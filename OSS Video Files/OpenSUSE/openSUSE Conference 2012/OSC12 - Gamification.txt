thank you um needham don't talk a little

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,269
bit about gamification and the

00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:16,410
implementing game elements in every day

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,980
designs um as I've heard of the first

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,910
one is a huge nada track which is quite

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:28,039
new and maybe either within the whole

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:34,110
conference I'm doing she knows so much

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:37,280
education association good can elope you

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:42,270
know getting origins which is working on

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:48,050
projects be engaged in projects let me

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:53,719
first talk a little bit about myself um

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,719
but instead he does when she's designing

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:04,650
actually what I really like to get

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:07,619
design is why are people motivated about

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,159
things that you do they really like that

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,460
you know how come they are so motivated

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,100
and if you look at games did you see

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,590
that people can get motivated in two

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,869
games that can really be indie games and

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,479
we really attached to the game and you

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,790
know be really in it and Walter churches

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:33,500
on it was his motivation is both

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:36,150
typically found in gaming so therefore

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,360
that few and you do that actually within

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,030
three companies this one it seems great

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,040
exceeds its popularity projects the

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,700
different companies on employing game

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,470
elements into 30 points but I'm also

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,380
working in a company called David

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,170
indication where we're going so we're

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,840
trying to build bridges between the game

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,040
industry and a non game industry and by

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,340
doing work using different

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,259
specifications and thirdly I'm also

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,469
working on a company which holds the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:12,080
idiot and its products were launching

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:17,210
and cooking an issue we're trying to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,360
am I wasting also true gaming games and

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,210
gamification but i want to start

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,880
actually with this this guy this guy

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,760
Eddie lives to like wait before we start

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,870
started counting maybe use and it said

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,810
something which is still really good

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,540
today because he said if you tell me

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,440
something you know that I forget what

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm saying would you saying if you show

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,030
me something you really showed to me but

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:52,250
if you really hold me really oh really

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:53,930
and what is its more forward way of

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,740
approaching to media yes that's why we

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,480
called a justlena forward media and not

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,130
only in the living room or not only

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,080
within internally but you also see if

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:06,050
the micro connection which is being like

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,420
forced we compel the game controller

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,130
more booty can really like your hand and

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,500
you're bored here to be able to interact

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,430
to play games with also change X with

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,430
the TV for instance

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,719
toodle-oo

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:49,370
yes is it so just you see you Adam why

00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:02,370
okay go I just won't go get some maybe

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,260
we should take a little bit further like

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:10,500
this um okay that's just about the mark

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,290
16 X you know can be before using a

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,530
bottle but all those different place

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,989
actually the game controller coming up

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,310
like likely return items and this is

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:26,490
interaction color their solution and

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,860
well older people really like its way we

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,110
think and money and well and they're

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,310
really into the game we will claim the

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,180
office yet a little bit of exercise

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:42,870
which they lately like and a success he

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:45,389
enjoyed so this whole interested singing

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,039
we don't be like that and you know

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,560
that's probably one of the reasons why I

00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,099
v8 the tailpiece easier really for

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,300
polymerase especially like interest in

00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:57,450
the game you like to feel in control

00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,570
like you do they nice and you know get

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:07,460
sick from that yeah which engage these

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:10,710
rocks and then just a month ago in the

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,970
resistors that commercial company and

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,360
then you convert personal media channels

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,630
and election we have to do during

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,889
commercials so does it have a show like

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,479
if you manage that commercial and you

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,449
get the extra information about the

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:34,010
product you're using the conversion rate

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:38,070
and are pretty quiet and well this is

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:42,919
something you like it like we like them

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:46,020
some sort of control baby he ate written

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,729
yeah but those weapons things you get

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,240
anywhere moving into records like where

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:54,840
you use the information sending and

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,580
receiving like itt weapon in jersey

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:02,389
thinking character this is a camel too

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,740
much time waiting for words we were just

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,820
biting it if you forgot to web you stop

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,419
uh so that you know you're getting

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,419
things you use buzzing lips so the way

00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,780
we could use a couple things in the new

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,870
black medium watch please maybe Jenna

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,020
well let's about you can do you in the

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,030
loop again looking to do some more you

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,760
know this is actually an honest with you

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,540
you can watch position of course we

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,200
painting zum zp pro-union there there's

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:42,960
many and ever you can apply to lean

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:46,530
protein uh so the fishy regret this

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,410
purchase feelingly control come come I

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,970
really why do you want to be a 20 i do

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,580
why do we want to do you all those

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:59,360
things well yeah a little bit a little

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:02,789
bit 0 minutes and i won't play horse

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,310
outside IV in shower ever I don't you

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,630
have a tendency to kind of thing we're

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,479
not probably allow I'll do everything

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,460
you want to do but still resent any

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,460
imagination shave you do you will

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,060
consultations you create super agent

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:22,289
origin and thinking about you were

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:25,889
reading i have to tell you do whatever

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:28,320
they want to do and another important

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,479
jeffries explain like you like I give

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,820
you send it could you tell me this huge

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,340
black where they're just until

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,940
being so you know with your own

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,970
imagination and all three babe you have

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:46,169
already motivated to play and to make up

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,360
your own well I'm stories and you can

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:51,150
also learn as well and when we were

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,220
laying learning fragrance about

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,470
communication or about social skills we

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,289
would learn with the kids oh it was just

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,139
a little earner I would start early with

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,210
it and then maybe be played after

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,409
session we would definitely learn and

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,409
could you better

00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:16,929
so that is thrilling by lightning

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:18,729
although there there is a pillow and the

00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,469
free space to play in the fact that you

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,949
had freedom and you could decide for

00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:25,899
yourselves what you wanted to do but

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,610
also the ability to learn like the fact

00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:29,919
that you could learn something from the

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,959
things you were doing that's apparently

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,229
really important and these three things

00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:38,079
actually are you can find in games as

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,139
well so games are often about you know

00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:42,579
these great epic tales there's a free

00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,350
space to play because you can make your

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:46,779
own decisions and you're in control of

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,389
the things you want to do well you can

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,029
decide yourself how you want to defeat

00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,350
that dragon for instance and and there's

00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:55,449
this ability to learn because you have

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,939
to get better in the game in order to

00:08:55,449 --> 00:09:02,589
improve and to get further and to you

00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:03,880
know succeed in playing the levels so

00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,040
that you can find these in games as well

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,009
for instance in this one World of

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:15,899
Warcraft I think well known to everyone

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:20,079
here and well this this game is really

00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,310
popular some figures 12 million players

00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,560
worldwide I think it's even more

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,050
nowadays but the figure actually which

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,410
strikes me most is the 22 hours of

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,000
gameplay but it's an average so they're

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,069
probably people would just play this one

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,889
or two hours a week maybe but they're

00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:38,050
guys who do this like 40 50 60 hours a

00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,600
week that's like a full-time job playing

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,639
World of Warcraft so you wonder why is

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,500
that like why is this game so immensely

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:48,339
popular what are the elements in this

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,040
game and which make it so really popular

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:55,029
and can we transfer these elements into

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,839
different fields which are not gaming so

00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:00,610
the question is actually that these

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,740
games are always about these fictive

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:10,089
worlds like it's it's never the real

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:13,569
world also always being imagined and and

00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,430
and so the question is actually can we

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,930
transfer this these elements which are

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,970
always being applied to this fictive

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,890
world into the real world so can we

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,630
combine

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,100
the elements of play which we had as

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,460
kids and you know where we're being

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,740
really motivated these kids to play with

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,660
the all the things we can do with the

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,870
lean forward media and can we combine

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,760
that and what do we get but actually if

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,540
you combine that you get into this

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,850
subject of gamification and which as a

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,180
gamification is the use of game elements

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,370
at techniques and so I've been borrowed

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,980
from the from the games industry it's a

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,680
non-game context so not in a game put in

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,350
something else to solve problems and

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,850
engage people and it's about applying

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,790
these game techniques into the real

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,920
world so in real situations and can we

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,300
do that and can we then achieve this

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,660
same level a same level of motivation

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,300
that you would get when playing games so

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,010
there well it's it's it's quite popular

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,540
actually and and there are already quite

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,790
a few examples so I want to give you

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,440
just a couple of examples of how games

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:25,390
get gamification is being applied

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,610
nowadays so and I will do that in a

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,430
couple of categories like this is the

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,250
first one and this is more the inside

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,890
out examples of gamification so company

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,720
decides to do something with

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,890
gamification on their own products or

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,360
service and to their consumers and so

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,600
they're applying that for all the people

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,950
who are using their product or service

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,330
second category is gamification just

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,720
within the company so within an

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,890
organization and I think this is

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,930
actually quite interesting for open

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,890
source as well because this is all about

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:04,620
how you how do you get your how do you

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:06,820
get your employees engaged into and well

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,950
creating your product and making a

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,470
better product and and being getting

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,330
them really engaged to work on it and

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,920
the third example which is a might be

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,710
interesting for for open source as well

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,690
is more of the outside in example so

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,780
it's it's well its of course the notion

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,150
of crowds crowd sourcing but can we use

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,400
gamification as well on crowdsourcing in

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,830
order to like motivate people and engage

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,350
people like lots of people in order to

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,550
bring data back to some sort of an

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,269
organization

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,589
just first category few examples and

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,990
within the field of mobility this is a

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:44,230
dashboard from the nissan leaf guard

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,810
which is electrical car and they build a

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,320
dashboard for all the Nissan Leaf

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:52,300
drivers and is said to them okay you

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,180
know this is your dashboard and you can

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,110
achieve points when you drive really

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,170
fuel efficient and the guy who or the

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:05,440
woman or the guy who drives the least we

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,750
uses the least few or least energy can

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,390
win a trophy so it's just a dashboard

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,760
it's really social everyone is it sits

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,350
in the dashboard and continuously you're

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,110
getting feedback on how you are doing

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,230
against all these other players and this

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:24,160
works really well apparently so people

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,600
really get motivated to UM be conscious

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,190
about their driving skills so

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,570
continuously when they're driving their

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,550
thinking about this dashboard and

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,870
they're thinking okay I want to do well

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,399
within this dashboard so for instance

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,430
you can drive fuel-efficient you know if

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,620
you accelerate really slowly or if you

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,600
take lots of time to break but you can

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,089
also drive really fuel efficient if you

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,880
don't stop for red light and apparently

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,440
that is happening like people are not

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,510
stopping for red lights because they

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,130
know if I stop for a red light I need to

00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,680
break and I need to accelerate and

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,350
that's not good for my position in the

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,300
dashboard so it's really strong this

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,360
this you know this notion of applying

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,709
these game elements here and and also in

00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,390
the field of sports this is an example

00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:09,370
there are many examples actually in the

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,250
field of sports and health but this is

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,740
one which is called stava and it's for a

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,529
cycling and this as well what they're

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,959
doing very well is you're getting points

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,459
for the fact that you're cycling and the

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,670
faster you cycle the more points you get

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:26,470
and they have this leaderboard where you

00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,449
can compare yourself to your friends but

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,360
also other people were cycling that

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,190
exact same route so you know that well

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,800
maybe you're cycling alone but you do

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:40,570
get the incentive of competition of

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:43,959
winning and winning from other cyclists

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:47,260
why not even even as sporting with them

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,760
and this you know this works very well

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,920
also also within running you got

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,140
RunKeeper you got nike plus there are

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,950
many examples and and they'll they'll

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,540
build on this idea of gamification and

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,940
also within the field of education the

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:04,600
Khan Academy maybe also unknown to to

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,400
some of you and but what they do is they

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,640
provide all kinds of online video

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,830
classes and they're giving this visual

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,350
map to all of their or students actually

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,080
and with the official map they're saying

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,720
okay you're really good in this area but

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,270
you have not succeeded yet this area so

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,100
if you want to have your whole your full

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,010
facial map colored because if you don't

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,430
if you don't do with something it's just

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,020
it's a black and white icon and then

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,480
then you get you know colored icons

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,250
there as well and and people like to

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,030
have their own visual map colored so

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,770
they're like working on on the facts so

00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:45,010
that they're working on that and getting

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:47,970
feedback from from from the system and

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,900
really trying to do everything and

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,410
really trying to do everything in all

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,110
the video classes in order to well get

00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,630
this whole visual map colored so those

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,340
are all examples from from inside out so

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,860
from an organization or company to all

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,750
the consumers or people users we're

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,210
using the product but also within

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,000
organizations and this is an example I

00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:13,090
found which is called play coal and it's

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,210
an example for in call centers and well

00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,610
you got the huge floors where

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,880
everybody's calling and often to sell

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,650
products but also support everything and

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,230
this is a system which is running on the

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,600
background while using the cooler well

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:33,220
while being on the phone and it monitors

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,560
your success of of what you're doing so

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,720
but your success but also your success

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,150
in relation to other other people were

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,990
you were in the call center so here also

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:47,140
you get a bit of competition between the

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,690
different people were on the phone and

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,190
that works really well as well and the

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,890
fact that there is competition works but

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,720
with only the fact that it's you know

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,960
that everybody can see what what

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,670
everyone is doing and how your success

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,000
rate is for example in all the calls you

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,190
do

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,490
so getting that feedback is already

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,010
really important and on on sales there's

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,939
this platform which is called sales

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,980
force which is monitoring all sales from

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,420
sales persons and also competing them

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,720
against each other and there are levels

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:22,060
there are points their badges rewards

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,160
everything so they borrowed a lot from

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,459
the gaming world had to apply that to

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,340
seals but also on and on the field of

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,990
crowdsourcing at Google well it's it I

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,480
don't think it ever got out of the beta

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,940
version but a couple years ago they had

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,430
the image labeler which is a bit of a

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:43,390
game so you're being attached to someone

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:46,270
else you login and you find another

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,820
player to play with and both of you get

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,550
an image for instance this image and you

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:54,340
have to type in text and if you type in

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,830
the the same tag then you get points you

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,450
both get points but you get more points

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,730
for special tags so if you would type in

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,070
your car then you just get you know and

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,900
not so many points but if you I don't

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,530
know if you would type in what is it an

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,300
oo D then you will get more points so

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,920
the thing is in the thing is that people

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,960
like to play with each other the whole

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,820
notion of having someone else somewhere

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,890
playing at that same time at the same

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,330
moment with you and for Google this is

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,240
extremely interesting because you know

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:26,050
it fills up their database with Dex so

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,450
it's crowdsourcing but then gamified and

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,700
as I think this is a really good example

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:35,110
it's called Foldit it's like really a

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,790
game and it's about enzymes and

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,800
apparently well I'm not really into this

00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,740
field but apparently enzymes are really

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,360
difficult structures and for computers

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,220
there are really difficult structures to

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,330
unfold like to really see how these

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,130
things are working and you know it has

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,050
all kinds of it has to do with patterns

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,840
and human human brains are actually

00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,190
really good in recognizing patterns so

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,440
what these guys did is they made a game

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:02,410
and they said okay we got a bunch of

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,590
enzymes here and you know please

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:08,290
recognize patterns for us and well this

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,020
is hugely popular and actually in 2011

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:14,380
last year there was a really good really

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,890
big breakthrough because a fire is that

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,050
could

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,290
us8 what was being discovered here

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,640
through the game and it was actually a

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,610
problem scientists were working on for

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,880
for more than 10 years and um gamers

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,780
lots of gamers and apparently figured it

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,530
out in just less than three weeks so

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,180
crowdsourcing of course is really

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,010
important but making it into a game

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,150
could engage lots of people more and

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,440
more to be able to work on this problem

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,660
so we could actually really say that

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,880
it's becoming a trend so if we look into

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,100
google trends and you type in

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,080
gamification we see that in late two

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,240
thousand ten it would was coming up and

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,460
it's you know it's getting higher and

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,290
higher so it's it's interesting it's

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,660
it's actually it's apparently popular

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,600
end well for some of the products it

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,640
really works and of course there are a

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,440
lot of people who do also forecasts into

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,630
the future and they're like and they're

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,910
saying well this gamification thing is

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,230
already like a big thing but it's

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,120
becoming bigger and bigger so they

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,730
expecting in two thousand i don't know

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,710
that is becoming like huge oh that every

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,950
company or every product has some sort

00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:26,410
of game elements in them in you know in

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:27,910
them to try to engage people um but then

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,040
the question is like how does it really

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,530
work like how does it how is it being

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,370
applied so let me just give you a brief

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,800
explanation on actually one of the well

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,250
maybe the company will start at the

00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,720
whole trend foursquare um it's just

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,860
about checking in and we'll actually

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,300
what their idea was to get people out of

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,410
the house more so that i wanted to have

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:57,180
a service for you for you to well see

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,740
your friends more and more and you know

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,460
what they did it was a check-in service

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:05,860
and i don't think they knew it got so

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,240
extremely popular but they use the

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,910
gamification elements quite good

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,100
actually so what they did is is it's a

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,680
four-step plan actually turn the first

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,970
step you have to give players some sort

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,330
of a choice you have to guide your

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,950
players and so you should never give too

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,540
much jersey or players so in the game as

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,480
well there always a couple of ways of

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,390
succeeding a mission they're never like

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,280
a hundred ways just a couple bridge

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,380
again make your own choice and making

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,390
your own choice means that you have

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,670
you're taking responsibility for that

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,290
choice you're making so in this case

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,260
well the choice is not that big because

00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,700
you can check in at different places and

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,350
in the second step what are you doing

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,990
you doing that choice you're performing

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,910
that action so in this case for

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,520
foursquare it's not checking in a

00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,130
certain venue and when you did that

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,360
you're getting directly feedback so in a

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,190
game as well you're doing something you

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,410
do in certain action getting directly

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,570
feedback on the things you've done so

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,860
what this this mean for you but what

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,330
does this mean for you in the game and

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:10,270
here as well you're getting directly

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,860
feedback in terms of points badges and

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,090
leaderboards so you're getting points

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,110
you can directly see in your leader

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,840
boards here it says in the in the bottom

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,030
that you're hot on Rick still so

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,470
apparently just a couple's checkings

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,480
check-ins more and then can beat him and

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,550
then the fourth step once you're getting

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,310
that feedback it means you can show

00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,330
progress so once you get feedback for

00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,280
instance you're getting a badge or

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,020
you're getting two batches you can show

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,300
progress and in this case it's being

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,240
shown as colored batches and black and

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,950
white things which you didn't get yet so

00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,260
this could motivate you to check-in more

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,310
because you want to get them all so

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,710
showing progress and then the following

00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,510
question is well how to apply to your

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,570
own product or service or business like

00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:01,390
if I've my own or maybe open source

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,340
projects how can I apply this and it's

00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,260
applying gamification like it's applying

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,090
these game elements always a guarantee

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,860
for success you know the gamification is

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,240
a bit of a trance but you know there's a

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,970
lot of sketches as well lots of people

00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,440
think well applying points and

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,550
leaderboards and badges doesn't work at

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,810
all and it's true it doesn't work like

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:26,770
it doesn't always work you have to

00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:29,050
applied in a good way it means that you

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,640
cannot just apply it but it means you

00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,710
really have to rethink about your

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,500
business like what is the thing I'm

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,320
doing what's the product I'm making and

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,910
how can i change that in order to get

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,330
people more and more engaged into my

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,330
products

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:50,650
so there there are several techniques

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,900
actually to apply a gamification and I

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,510
just want to give you a couple of them

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,950
and I think one of one of the things

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:02,200
which is really important to start with

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:04,030
is behavior it's always really important

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,030
to think about the users that are using

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,740
your product it could be if that's

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,750
applied internally that's your employees

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,300
but if it's for a product that is your

00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,309
users and and you need to think about

00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,100
what would kind of people they are and

00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:21,460
and what kind of behavior they're

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,650
currently in so in this case i already

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,630
showed this image the question is what's

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,160
their current behavior like well

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,900
apparently they're just sitting on the

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,090
couch doing nothing it's not really a

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,760
healthy lifestyle so in terms of healthy

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,620
lifestyle that desired behavior it

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,850
should be different a desired behavior

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,980
should be that there would be you know

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,360
being exercising more and more that

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,820
they're walking or that they're going

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,190
outside or doing something and this

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,309
company called Fitbit try to do that and

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:55,809
with little tracker and you keep it with

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:57,730
you during the day and once you walk and

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:02,200
once you take steps once you run it

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:04,929
monitors that and a little flower is

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,920
growing on this tracker and so in the

00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,350
beginning of the day this flower is

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,940
really small it just has one leaf but

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,890
maybe in the end of the day it has like

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,390
many leaves it has about ten leagues it

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,770
means that you had a good day that you

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,210
exercise that day so you're getting

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:21,100
feedback on your amount of exercise um

00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,320
and apparently this works this works

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,240
like people getting motivated to

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,860
exercise or at least a move because if

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,690
they do that if they're just going to

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,570
walk to the supermarket they see and and

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,820
actually leave on their Fitbit and it

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,730
motivates them to you know walk or run

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,929
more and more and also in this situation

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,990
and it's it's quite actually in a famous

00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:46,900
example it has been on the internet well

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,150
maybe almost everywhere but this is a

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,760
Stockholm is the exit of a subway

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,760
station where everybody always would

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,549
take the escalator no one would take the

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,129
stairs

00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:00,470
and why yeah because the escalator is

00:25:58,129 --> 00:26:03,259
simple it's easy to use like everyone

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:08,059
does that and taking the stairs would

00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:10,519
require serious skills or or well not

00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:14,389
skills but it would it would it would

00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:16,940
require some and some condition to to to

00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:18,739
walk up the stairs but what if we would

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,499
make it a little bit more fun to do what

00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:23,179
if we would give like direct feedback

00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:26,119
what if we would change the stairs into

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:29,389
a play on upstairs and then apparently

00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,429
that works because lots of in this in

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:34,700
this research apparently sixty-six

00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:37,279
percent of the people of a took the

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,320
stairs instead of the escalator and what

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,509
this thing does is that every step you

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,100
take on the on the stairs is making a

00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:45,109
different kind of sound so you can

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,299
compose your own music while walking

00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:51,679
walking up stairs or even work together

00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:55,340
with lots of people in order to to to

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,230
make ya a good music composition and

00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,690
this is lots of fun for people so they

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,039
think okay well this is fun so they're

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,629
working up the stairs but it's not only

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,100
fun it's also the fact that they're

00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:06,049
getting direct feedback the things they

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:10,340
do it's some sort of an instant

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,720
gratification and so people are changing

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,429
behavior so you always have to think

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,159
about what's the current behavior of the

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,769
users of my target group and what do I

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,879
want them to do how do I want them to

00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:23,809
behave so what's their desired behavior

00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:25,190
so once you figured out what that

00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:28,460
desired behavior is you're looking for

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,769
it's important to realize how to get

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:36,889
there like what goals and challenges are

00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:38,269
you presenting to these people and you

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,850
have to make sure that these goals and

00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:42,350
challenges are really interesting like

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:46,489
really interesting for that specific

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:49,220
target group so take a game of goal for

00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:51,889
instance it has quite a clear goal

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,179
there's this bowl there's this but and

00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:55,909
you have to place the ball on the pit

00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,529
that's it that's the goal so that's

00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,960
actually very easy you just grab the

00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:02,359
bowl walk through the birds will walk to

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,700
the hole and just drop it in that's it

00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:06,950
well that's not fun but that's

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,730
apparently the goal of the game so what

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,860
they did is well

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,010
they thought okay we make rules and we

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,270
make obstacles and let's try to make the

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,299
game of golf a little bit more difficult

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,700
and apparently that works to make the

00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,620
game more interesting so this is of

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,020
course an example but it counts for all

00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,270
kinds of sports and we apparently

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,250
voluntarily agree on upon these rules

00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,770
and obstacles so we say okay we're going

00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,840
to play golf and we agree on the facts

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:37,320
that there are boundaries and that we

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,820
cannot well that we need to stick to hit

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,309
the ball we cannot throw the ball all

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,620
kinds of things be fallin terribly agree

00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,350
upon that and then we play the game and

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,240
we think that is fun and why is that fun

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,980
because the challenge is it gives us are

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,570
really interesting like this is

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,210
interesting for golfers this is

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,220
interesting to be in there and to try to

00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,750
learn and to become better in in hitting

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,360
the ball out of the out of the sand pit

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,370
so then really achieving these

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,549
challenges and really succeeding in

00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:08,250
doing these and well feels good and it's

00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:12,150
fun to do so how did other websites do

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,860
that mint is a website where you where

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,370
they're trying to help you with your

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,660
financials personal financials there I

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:22,110
think lots of people who have really

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,880
trouble of on maintaining those and what

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,950
they're saying is well we are creating

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,679
really personal goals for you like goals

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,480
which are really interesting for you as

00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,850
a user and those goals are for instance

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,650
paying off your debts or saving for a

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,030
holiday for instance but maybe you

00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,220
really have to say for for a certain

00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,230
holiday want to do so you type in the

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,059
goal and mint is helping you to achieve

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:48,929
that goal so you're constantly getting

00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:50,610
feedback on how far you're off your

00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,070
holiday and what you still need to save

00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,020
we're still need to do in order to get

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,640
that holiday and then at a certain point

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,470
you achieve the goal you make the

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,410
challenge and then you're being rewarded

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,950
of course by that holiday so there's

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:06,870
always this constant feedback and fold

00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,080
it as well they are not so much so much

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:12,720
personal goals in here and well it could

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,750
be of course but I hope not actually but

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,220
there are social goals so once you

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,570
played it you really have the feeling

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,900
that you're part of something bigger

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,620
that you're part of a really big social

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,110
thing or experience

00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,990
and that thrives people as well like

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:31,800
being really motivated because they're

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:35,340
in this social projects and and the last

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,870
thing goals can also be really created

00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,930
around interest so this is a website

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:42,930
called get blue the interest here is TV

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,280
and a series and people are coming

00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,790
together year they are building this

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,059
huge community on information about

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,700
sharing information and knowledge about

00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:57,570
different movies or TV series and this

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:59,840
this platform is is huge like there are

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,190
lots of the community is really big and

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,340
and what is of course just an example

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,440
about TV series and films but creating

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,140
communities is always really difficult

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,320
but gamification solutions can really

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,890
help building this community and getting

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,050
these communities go viral and and you

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:23,130
know getting it really big in just a

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:25,170
short amount of time but again the goal

00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:28,500
should be really interesting the goals

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,150
need meaning because this doesn't have

00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,309
any meaning actually because if you

00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,700
would get this by just leaving the

00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,440
house and well it would probably not

00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,790
motivate you to leave the house if you

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,000
know we just get this badge and that's

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:45,360
it so it's just not a matter of applying

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,100
batches and there are other side effects

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,679
as well you need to think about so this

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,470
is a service called a cola and they

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,210
already stopped a couple of years ago

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,950
because well they did in the beginning

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,260
they grew really big like there was this

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,000
big community but then they stopped and

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,220
why is that well the idea of this

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,530
service was to get more social

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,140
connections between your friends or

00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:09,030
maybe people you don't even know and by

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,700
using these cards and one of these cards

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,470
is inviting someone for coffee so you

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
would go to one of your friends and you

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,980
would say oh come on let's drink a

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,260
coffee she'll go to cafe drink a coffee

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,580
and then once you would be there you

00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,590
would talk you would give him this card

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,700
and there would be a coat on there in

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:29,190
the little gray field you've given this

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,580
card and this guy need to go to the echo

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,650
website and fill in the emission ID and

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,070
then you are getting points because he

00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:39,070
filled in the cart

00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:41,050
and what is that the court could be

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,090
reused so you know where it was

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:46,420
travelling in the world like if it would

00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,740
where would go so that's nice but the

00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,380
thing is if you would drink coffee with

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,910
a friend of you he would say hey can you

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,430
please fill in this mission ID on the

00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:57,160
ICO website he would think like okay why

00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,930
why are you drinking coffee with me like

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,910
is it because you like me you want to

00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:03,040
talk to me or is it just because of this

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,110
stupid mission like why are you doing

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,350
this so it's really important as well

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,000
that if you are setting challenges and

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,950
goals for your users that you have to

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,040
think through different scenarios like

00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,890
what could happen and how could you you

00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:23,140
know how could this feel to certain

00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,610
people um okay so then you have the

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,290
goals and the challenges but then you

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,030
still need to get to those goals and

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,920
challenges and that's being done

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,870
actually by creating really small tasks

00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,670
so in games as well this is used as well

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:35,650
like a level is a goal or a challenge

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,820
we're in order to succeed on a goal or a

00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,570
challenge you have to do lots of

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:42,220
different small tasks and you have to

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,040
guide your user so you have to help them

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,320
on that so how do you do that um you

00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,720
have to give them the difference well

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,960
but it's really important that the tasks

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,400
are the right amount of difficulty so

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,990
let me just explain by a game we all

00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,280
know any words immensely popular while

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,130
it's actually strange because you have

00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,890
to throw little birds at little green

00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,510
pigs I mean if you explain that everyone

00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:11,650
would think okay you crazy this cannot

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:14,350
get popular but it's it's huge it's the

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,090
most popular mobile game so why is it

00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,920
popular well one of the reasons is that

00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,400
it's really well-designed and its really

00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,800
well-designed because of the relation

00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,150
between skills and difficulty so in the

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,400
beginning of the game the first levels

00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:30,730
are really easy to do so your skills are

00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,380
still really small um but the level of

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,660
difficulty you're getting is really low

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,030
as well so that's good but once you're

00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:39,880
getting into the game your skills are

00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:43,510
improving and you already threw some

00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,540
birds at pigs um so you know how it

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,860
works and but the difficulty the level

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,780
of difficulty is getting bigger as well

00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,460
so you you're getting this big

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,890
structures you need to overcome

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,150
difficult and then at the end of the

00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,220
game it's getting like extremely

00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:00,550
difficult but your skills are growing as

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:04,780
well so the importance here is that this

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:07,150
line is upwards and we call an in game

00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,150
design we call that flow and it's really

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,470
important to stay in that flow so this

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,270
is important for games but this is

00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,830
important for everything like this is

00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,720
important for schools as well with an

00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:19,060
education or we then work if you're

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,910
working in in our organization and you

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,960
get your getting things to do in the

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,090
beginning that you're working there

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,240
which are extremely difficult you know

00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,500
then you get some sort of an anxiety or

00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,690
inversion against that job you're doing

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,880
but also if you work already at a

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,290
company for a couple of years and the

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,380
things you have to do are still so

00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:40,270
extremely easy they're not difficult you

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,970
know then boredom sets in then it's not

00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:48,130
a fun job to do so staying in this flow

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:49,480
is extremely important um and staying in

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:51,040
this flow means learning because honey

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,020
your skills are improving over time so

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,990
it means learning and there was this

00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,640
game designer he said bearing is fun

00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,920
when we think back to our schools we

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,230
don't and necessarily agree on that not

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,100
always but actually like the human mind

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:08,830
wants to learn and learning is fun so

00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,840
only learning is actually only fun if

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:13,300
it's being done in the right conditions

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,430
liking it in the right setting we need

00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,930
the right context and games are fun

00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,940
because they're all he sets they're

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,280
clean systems which encourage our brains

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,840
to learn and eventually master them so

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,310
the fact that you know that you're

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,500
playing this game and you're learning

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,660
and you know that probably at the end of

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,260
the game you're really mastering those

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:35,200
skills you need to to be able to do the

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,710
game in to have successfully played the

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,910
whole game that motivates us and other

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:46,230
motivates us to play that game um and if

00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,970
you want to apply this to let's say a

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,820
community or some sort of a tool or

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,660
service online service you can do this

00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,610
by dividing your users into three

00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,640
different categories it could be more I

00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:02,099
think three is a good number so once

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,630
people are getting

00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,029
familiar with your product or service

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,170
they're still beginners but once they're

00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:09,269
already working a little bit on your

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,470
product serves their experts but once

00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,999
they're really good and they know all

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,890
the features and then there you know

00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:17,729
really know how to use it then their

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:20,549
master and Twitter for instance well the

00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:23,309
website does this end falling away like

00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:25,470
when you apply for a new accounts your

00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:28,019
beginner then on board against really

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,849
important so it's just you're just in

00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,529
this process for maybe a minute two

00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:33,720
minutes maybe even less than a minute

00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,160
the only thing here you have to do is to

00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,529
build your timeline so they're saying

00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,269
okay this is your goal they're saying

00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:41,039
start by following five people that's

00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:42,920
your goal really easy not difficult

00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,239
because your skills are still really low

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,579
you just follow five people so they give

00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,440
the list and once you doubt that you

00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,910
know once you've done that are you not

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,690
longer beginner any more than your

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,819
expert and an expert's what day one is a

00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,829
new content for new activities for maybe

00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:01,640
new friends so they want to get new

00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:04,140
interesting content so to look at

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,809
twitter is doing this on the left side

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,339
the other box saying who to follow so

00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:11,279
once you're already in the system you're

00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,719
using it already how can you like

00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:16,920
improve how can you get better into the

00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,869
system and you can really monster it by

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,569
really well by being lady gaga for

00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:23,749
instance with her 23 million followers

00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:25,950
probably a little bit more by now and

00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:29,400
you can see the cheese a monster because

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:33,390
she has the blue v at the end of the

00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,999
name so this is like a really like a

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,069
really personality within the service so

00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:39,299
this in every cervical work like in

00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:40,890
Foursquare for instance this is the

00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:42,660
mayor's like then you're really

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,339
mastering a certain venue with your

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,789
mastering the the service you really

00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:50,069
know how it works and lastly which is

00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:53,400
really important is don't forget the fun

00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:55,680
and fun is not meant here so much as

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,009
humor or you know making jokes or

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,839
whatever it is part of of having fun but

00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:04,229
also which I told earlier that learning

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,029
can be fun and Bernie de Koven is

00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:07,710
another game designer you said well if

00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:10,559
it's not fun why are we still playing so

00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,180
is he saying if you make a game which is

00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,190
not fun then you can forget it because

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,540
no one will play it so there needs to be

00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,270
elements of fun in there

00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,170
an element's of fun can also be in

00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:25,800
stories like this base invaders

00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:28,380
extremely successful game old game and

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,230
there is a huge narrative in here

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,440
because these are all aliens invading

00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,150
the world and you need to protect those

00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,160
aliens from reaching the world by

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,900
shooting at them so this is a lot of

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,430
this kind of an epic tale actually where

00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,650
you're in so you're being the hero if

00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,470
you succeed on killing all those aliens

00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,690
before they enter your world but if we

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,270
would say okay you're a green block and

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:53,910
these are white blocks and make sure the

00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,980
white blocks disappear then it's not so

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,670
fun anymore so then it's not a fun game

00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,960
so make sure you have a good narrative

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,360
so in game design this is of course

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,340
being applied all the time but also in

00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,720
gamification is being applied and and I

00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,510
really like this example it's called

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,130
zombies run and this is an iphone

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,200
application and you have it in your

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:16,080
pocket while you're running and you have

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,150
your ear plugs in and it has a GPS

00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,800
tracker so it knows where you are it

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,870
knows your speed of running so you start

00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,750
running and then really in the back you

00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,930
hear some zombies really slowly you'd

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,790
end up making that much sound yes but if

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,080
you don't run fast enough you will hear

00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,960
them coming and they're coming at you

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,370
like you even breathing your neck so you

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,140
need to run faster and once you run

00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,150
faster you you would notice that the

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,430
zombie sounds are getting lower and

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,930
lower again so this is really fun

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,180
they're they're applying like a really

00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:49,080
nice nice narrative into this game in

00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:51,660
order for people to run to exercise so

00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,250
that's that's this fun as well but the

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,880
fun can also be like really in a simple

00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:59,190
stuff mailchimp for instance they're

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,930
doing really simple things like you're

00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,180
the monkey saying I love the smell of

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:07,290
email in the morning it just gets you in

00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:09,900
a certain mood and and be able to do

00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:12,300
things who perform certain actions when

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,310
in a little bit over more relaxed fun

00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,310
mood is apparently far more productive

00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,570
and Foursquare is doing it as well once

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,240
you're getting batches for instance

00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,460
dispatch which is the historian badge

00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,550
probably because this guy went to some

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:27,660
sort of a historic venue um and the

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,620
badge is saying that Thomas Jefferson

00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,720
would be

00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:35,520
really proud of you because you visited

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:39,270
this venue so that's fun as well so to

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,890
conclude if you think about the desired

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,450
behavior you want to achieve really

00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,770
think about that and how this target

00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:47,040
group could achieve this desired

00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:49,020
behavior and think about who you want to

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,600
change and think about the current

00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:54,750
behavior and the desired behavior but

00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,700
also think about the values of this

00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,370
target group like what do they think is

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,990
important and how could they get to that

00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:03,180
desired behavior so what are the

00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,830
challenges that you're presenting to to

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,690
these users and are these challenges

00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,300
really interesting and personal for

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,310
these people but also really think about

00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,170
the side effects like which side effects

00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,780
can emerge really think about all the

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,640
scenarios let's think through the net

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,330
challenges that are in your game or in

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,630
your gamification solution always try to

00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:26,040
get your place in a certain flow make

00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,360
sure that the tasks and challenges

00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,670
they're getting in the beginning or easy

00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,050
but there are more difficult in the end

00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:35,450
of the game or in the gamification

00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:38,450
solution and never never forget the fun

00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,450
thank

00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:53,410
again maybe there are some questions

00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:58,029
from the audience I think there's my hi

00:42:53,410 --> 00:43:00,549
I wanted to ask about the flow you put a

00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:04,559
linear approach in though do you think

00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:08,170
any other growth rates would work like

00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:11,020
not so linear but in a curve I don't

00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:13,029
know well I think sir on it i never

00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,440
think it's always like a straight line

00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:16,599
because that would be impossible and

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,210
everyone is different so for everyone

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,660
that curve or line would be a little bit

00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,549
less or more steep so probably it's

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,829
always an area where you're in so

00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:28,539
they're probably like multiple lines but

00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:30,490
once you're in that area and you stay in

00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:33,430
that area so it could be like a bit of a

00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:35,410
wave as well then it's good so it's

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,270
always about an area which is important

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:44,140
to be in and the importance is probably

00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:46,270
not to get too far off that area I'm

00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:50,079
ready still tweet before the session

00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:52,720
that you said how gamification can help

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,630
open source did you recover that sir

00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,279
because I rather late well a little bit

00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,589
but not not too much actually because I

00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:00,700
was making his presentation and was not

00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:03,250
thinking too much about open source

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,470
actually but I do think that it could

00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:07,299
really help with an open source it's

00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,730
always it's of course really important

00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:11,680
that this group of people that is

00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,470
working on a project is co designing a

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,869
certain projects a certain software

00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,069
product for instance it's really

00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:22,270
important that all these people are

00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:25,210
really engaged in making that product

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,529
and I was I was thinking about that

00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,490
yesterday actually while we're having

00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:34,299
dinner with some of the speakers and

00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:36,270
that a it will the idea of open sources

00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:38,319
of course that everything you make is

00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:41,230
free and available and everyone can

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,750
build upon that but still the respect of

00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:47,529
the things you're making is really

00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:49,450
important and gamification is also all

00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:51,250
about respect as well like if you are

00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:55,299
doing something if you're sharing

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,740
information on a community then you can

00:44:55,299 --> 00:44:57,490
always still see where that information

00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,950
is coming

00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,510
so who gave that information and you can

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,630
see where that information is going and

00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:08,140
who is using that information and so if

00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:11,170
you apply those elements for like a

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,510
certain tool in order to well with that

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,770
to build your open source project then I

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,050
think gamification could definitely work

00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,700
in order to motivate people really to

00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:26,680
work on that project and get them really

00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:30,000
engaged um agree but I would be

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,460
extremely careful where it opens us a

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,060
employers because people contribute to

00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,490
open source mainly out of an intrinsic

00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,610
motivation so I do this because I like

00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:45,160
it or I want to make the world a better

00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:47,470
place and so on and not necessarily for

00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,210
an extrinsic motivation like someone is

00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,780
paying me or someone is giving my badges

00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:55,480
and so on so i think i need to be really

00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,970
careful where and how you employed us to

00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,869
not destroy the motivation for people

00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:04,000
who are in a long term yeah i totally

00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:06,220
agree in that like they're always needs

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,109
to be a really good balance between the

00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,540
intrinsic and the exchanging motivation

00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:13,720
so there's been a lot of ritual research

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,980
on that and apparently only intrinsic

00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,170
motivation doesn't work and only

00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,450
extrinsic motivation doesn't work so we

00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,040
always need to have a good balance and

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,780
that's actually why a lot of

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,520
gamification solutions are going wrong

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,859
because the only focus on the extrinsic

00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,390
and they really need to think about so

00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,270
that's always that's also with the goals

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:33,130
the goals need to be really personal or

00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,780
they need to be really social you need

00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:39,130
to somehow feel connected to the goals

00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:41,460
otherwise it wouldn't work we don't have

00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:44,050
time for more questions so please dial

00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,570
let us know where we can find you for

00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,310
more information well you can find me of

00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:51,490
course on one Twitter actually that

00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:55,240
would be the most easy it's on the

00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:57,609
bottom I'm talking about here oh but

00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:02,040
