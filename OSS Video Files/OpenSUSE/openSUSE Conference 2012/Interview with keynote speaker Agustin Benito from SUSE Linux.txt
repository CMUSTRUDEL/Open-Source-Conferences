00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,359
resources that suicide pool in opensuse

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,840
or open because they are too much too

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:41,550
many and and from the Canary Islands

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:45,120
pain I work in Germany hello and also I

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,360
have some professional background as

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,620
interpreter on manager project manager

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,469
program manager and also as a community

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,449
may background probably most of the

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,930
people know me because I'm involving

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,100
kitty what can we expect a deed in the

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,549
next event I'm proud okay in terms of

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:12,270
contents in terms of talks this is a

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:16,350
huge event we have something like seven

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,350
or eight tracks in a row we have not

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,409
just the four tracks we have on Saturday

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,500
and Sunday but we also have several

00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:29,189
other meetings different groups

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:33,119
organizing activities you in the end we

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:38,630
have booths so in terms of contents is a

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:43,430
really really big event so it's complex

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:47,270
that provides also a lot of choices and

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:51,299
we definitely have really good speakers

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:55,619
in all the areas in the technical part

00:01:51,299 --> 00:02:00,460
but also we have few really good talks

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:05,810
really good speakers that are going to

00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:09,860
deliver really nice conferences oriented

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,750
to non-technical audience so even if you

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,819
are not the developer even if you are

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,150
not in really involved in free software

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,190
but you are worried about technology or

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,310
you are excited about technology how it

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,860
changed how they affect society how we

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,920
affect some of our rights if you are

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,150
produce about cool problem that not just

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
from the technical perspective but also

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,080
from other perspective we have room for

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,700
you in the conference without an offer

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,970
for you in the conference and definitely

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,980
if you are a techie you're a geek if you

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,500
are free software developer you are

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,660
interested in telling in different

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,380
software technologies you will have

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,200
plenty of offers here even if you are

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,680
not an open suse user or developer or

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,560
gentle contributor or really involving

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:02,989
in the gnu/linux you have plenty of

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,540
interesting talks we also going to have

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:11,140
some contents business-friendly so if

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:16,220
you are a manager or you are planning to

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,989
buy or or you're interested on more than

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,769
more on the commercial side of the

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:24,230
technology we also have contents for you

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,630
we have parties of course the community

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:32,720
event without cool parties is not a

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:36,110
community event and I think we we have a

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,819
really really complete event for

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,200
different

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:46,049
audiences we are expecting a lot of food

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,209
energy a lot of attendance at least

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:54,000
thank you so what will be the subject of

00:03:49,209 --> 00:04:01,030
the keynote the keynote presentation

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,989
goes about or tries to make people aware

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:09,250
of how important already are but

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,010
especially might become the small

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,419
companies for community projects in

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,599
general that especially for

00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:21,820
distributions like open suse or like

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:27,220
gentle who are the two the two wounds in

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:33,310
every involved in this event so I don't

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:36,130
try to make people think about small

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,139
companies as a target and how beneficial

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,430
they could be called for us in some

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:45,419
areas so you argue that small businesses

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,800
are important for the success of lenox

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:52,030
how do you see the future of Susan

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,120
opensuse in that regard well Suzy has

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,270
been going through changes especially

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,490
since the attachment acquisition of the

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:06,340
bill we are we are doing really good in

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,949
the business and commercial part we are

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:14,560
growing and we are in a good position of

00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:17,139
support even more than we have done in

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:23,889
the past which was a lot opensuse

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:26,979
project this means that we are in that

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:31,180
good times are coming we are making the

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:33,340
internal changes to be able to support

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,919
even more and in a more efficient way to

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:41,080
open Susan and I think for during the

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,610
following year we will see many good

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:49,569
things happening

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:54,400
suisei not just because of this increase

00:05:49,569 --> 00:06:00,599
of support but also because the opensuse

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,599
community has some strength that we can

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:10,780
take advantage of to make some steps

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:13,439
forward and place yourself in a much

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,169
better position that we are right now

00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:23,469
especially in some in some important

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:27,219
areas so well associating lead I think

00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:31,050
we are going to see some exciting second

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:34,719
moments in the near future we are really

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,990
really happy about those in Susa we feel

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,389
that we have a lot to add to the to the

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,830
project and the project itself is going

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:49,180
to be I'm going to have a lot of good

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:52,240
energy in your future so yeah that's

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,659
that's probably the is probably not

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,940
clear now because we are still in the

00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:59,639
working in allowing bound but it will be

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,190
clear that during the following year

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,930
okay a brightening crushin future now

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,430
why would people want to be involved

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:11,919
with this and free software and general

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,569
for somebody that is young somebody that

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,750
is starting to want to become a

00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,969
developer one of the first things that

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:23,560
he has to understand in my opinion is

00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:28,270
that the only limitation to learn and to

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,550
become a good professional the only

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:36,659
limitation that this person should face

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,659
it's how strong how much he works and

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,720
there are there are other many other

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,510
limitations when you want to become a

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:52,240
good professional software developer

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:55,600
most of those limitations are has

00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:00,310
nothing to do with how much you can

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:04,930
learn how much you can improve it has to

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,960
do with barriers imposed by by third

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,170
parties by others the free software what

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,170
can provide you is the information you

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,610
need to make sure that the only

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:20,050
limitation you find out in your life

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:23,890
it's your own effort that you can get to

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,580
where we want because all the tools all

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:30,220
information all the people that you need

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,870
to do that you need to help you in the

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,520
in the in the way of becoming a

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:39,880
professional are valuable so I think

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,100
choosing free software us as the base or

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,550
your professional career it's a smart

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:51,160
move if you want to become a very big

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:55,870
developer so you make sure that you are

00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:00,340
the only career so all the limitations

00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:03,760
side side you're not outside of it I

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,440
think it's a smart move simply it's not

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,420
because it's better or it's worse

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,790
already know it simply is a smart

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,770
decision that concludes our interview

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,990
