I'd and get going so thanks for joining

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:10,710
the session today everyone kind of

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,530
reminds me when I used to do sound

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,480
systems from and when I was in college

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,210
but he would get some feedback

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,100
occasionally so the concept here for

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,699
this round table is to talk about how

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,300
the concepts and philosophy principles

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,160
of openness can apply to all kinds of

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,550
things in addition to open source

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,040
software so other elements of society in

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,649
our lives and we wanted to expand our

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,030
scope of discussion and kind of have a

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,489
philosophical philosophical in a

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,940
conceptual discussion all together today

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,010
with two maybe three panelists if our

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,309
third arrives and make this very

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,860
interactive and we've got some very

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,719
interesting folks here who work with the

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,300
concept of openness in a variety of

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,910
different ways so the idea here is that

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,850
we ask these guys some questions and

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,820
start a discussion and see where that

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,799
leads us so first I'd like to just do

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,420
some introductions I'll introduce myself

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,060
very quickly and then we'll have these

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,759
guys introduce themselves my name is

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,880
michael miller and have the privilege

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,090
and honor to be working at souza which

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,159
is great and do things like our

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,140
alliances and marketing product

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,750
management so I'm really excited to be

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,259
here and just to participate and get to

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,290
know you guys and talk about openness so

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,720
boss if you could introduce yourself

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,460
yeah so I'm bus I think some of the

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
people were already here when I did my

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:49,700
presentation but most of the stuff I do

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:53,070
is related to article that virtual the

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,409
virtual versus the physical and not not

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,560
so much versus but integration of these

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,969
two worlds so I'm much involved in fab

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,549
labs for example fabrication

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:07,740
laboratories yeah it by background is

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,410
interaction design and I work with

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,410
electronics both s with software so

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,200
all right my name is are mine I'm an

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,170
engineer as you can see I in my daily

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,330
job I mostly work with lawyers what I do

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,150
is I've been active for quite a quite a

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,470
while in GPL violation stork license

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,400
enforcement I'm doing stuff with

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,650
patterns mostly what I do is I care a

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,050
lot about reducing risk with openness

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,660
the well with open source and just

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,490
increasing openness and making sure that

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,670
people like developers like you can just

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:49,920
keep kicking ass alright so I've got a

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,900
few questions for these guys but ideally

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,430
were also interested in getting

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,770
questions for all of you in the audience

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,140
so it does anybody have a question they

00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,670
want to kick this off with and if not

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,730
I'll go ahead and throw one out there to

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,040
start us all right let me let me throw

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,660
one out there for four are mine you know

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,990
there's been a lot of a lot of lawsuits

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,380
lately and particularly in the mobile

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,650
industry and so you get some people you

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,640
know getting the question of does GPL

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,630
really work the way it should and and

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,780
you know what are your thoughts about

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,110
how effective is that model and how does

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,700
it relate to some of the more recent

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:34,470
high-profile litigation that's been

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,090
going on all right so first of all on

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,800
the things you are referring to our

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,330
patent lawsuits and patents and

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,780
copyrights are two completely distinct

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,040
distinct things there are completely

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,170
different beats because they're the

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,050
license is about actual code patterns

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,910
are more about no ideas things that are

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,100
very very fate vague you cannot just

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,930
look at something and then say that's an

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,900
idea but I can look at something and say

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,420
that's code so what I would like to do

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,270
is I like to keep those things apart and

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,510
I would not let I never like to mix

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:09,780
copyright stuff patent stuff but if

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,480
you're talking about GPL enforcement of

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,160
cases that that have been done in Europe

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,790
and also in the u.s. I think they

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,759
actually have

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,209
been very effective I've done some work

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,310
for companies in for example Taiwan and

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:26,550
while they were first very very hesitant

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,880
about doing anything with GPL because

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,320
they they were being sued by I well at

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,690
least one of their customers was being

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,180
sued they were very afraid of open sores

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,370
in a GPL right now they've got a few

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,800
people thinking and say well you know

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:44,070
maybe we should actually upstream all

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,539
this and and if in the next few months I

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,820
hope that they will I will get and get

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,490
to see the first few patches coming out

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,599
of Taiwan for those particular devices

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,610
and it's because they get it it needed

00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,770
they needed to have a push illegal push

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,620
but actually there was something good

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,669
coming out of it it took two years but

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,699
something good is coming out of it so I

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:12,750
actually think it is very effective I'm

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:15,539
very positive about that anybody in our

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,240
audience here have a question or

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:20,220
follow-up or comment on on that Klaus me

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:27,900
bring the mic to you or you go in there

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:30,210
ok so I'm interested how can we transfer

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,930
the concept of open to the consumers I

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:37,080
mean pushing companies legalize is one

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,449
way but I wonder would it be better if

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,630
the consumer would be pushing the

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:45,750
companies to be more open and I wonder

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:48,720
how how this could could be could be

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:51,360
done I mean all we geeks and hackers we

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,020
know how good open is but I even have

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,199
trouble transferring this to my kids and

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,000
they like your son come with a device

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,830
and the usual reaction from them throw

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,919
it away buy me a new one so what what

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,639
what could we do to to transfer the

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:17,220
value of open to a broader community

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:19,530
outside of the heck earth I think one of

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,380
the things which is really important is

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:25,560
that seeing openness not only as

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,129
openness but also as a verb you know

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,610
opening is is

00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:36,639
getting questions about you know being

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,769
being curious about what's inside being

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,599
aware of what what our stuff is made I

00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:46,219
think one of the things that really

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:50,689
helps there is still education so if you

00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:53,989
really want to start with the culture of

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:56,269
openness and the culture of opening and

00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:57,889
open culture itself I think you have to

00:06:56,269 --> 00:07:00,259
start with education as well to be able

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,319
to not only get it into the professional

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,269
sphere or you know once the hits

00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,599
the fan and you know you have to go

00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:09,769
legal on it it's an attitude you you

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,610
probably have to have within your

00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:15,019
education as well so I have a follow-up

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,659
question for you on that do you think

00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,469
that through education we can actually

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:25,129
create a a consumer of future consumers

00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:27,949
who see openness as as value actually

00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:30,679
create demand for openness rather than

00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,439
trying to push open us into the consumer

00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,999
market actually create demand where

00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,749
there's a value what that's understood

00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:41,209
and there's a pool instead of push yeah

00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:44,929
I think one of the interesting things

00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:48,139
when you look at education right now is

00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:49,939
that you see that I mean that I work

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,029
along with art schools I work a lot with

00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:54,319
design academies and that kind of

00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,909
institutes and and we have a full

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,379
program we run the creative comments

00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,839
program and not in the Netherlands and

00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:02,869
we have a full program on open design

00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,969
and besides all the legal issues we have

00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:07,909
there because that's huge when you go

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:13,550
into a real product there's also this

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:16,039
this thing where where you see that the

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,329
attitudes of people being created

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:23,300
especially in the creative and creative

00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:26,089
phase of know of getting to the ideas

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,219
making a design it's really important to

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,709
show people that they inspire each other

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,810
and that you can actually credit people

00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,370
for the inspiration you get that you can

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,500
work together that you have all these

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,490
technologies in place right now to do

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,320
things more distributed

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,430
and especially in Holland you see a lot

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,060
of ego design and ego centric signature

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,500
design which is we're really good at it

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,040
beautiful product but on the other hand

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,899
that I don't think it fits the world

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,520
right now and that's why both in come

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,040
together like your question was how can

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,670
it how can consumers react to that well

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,220
I think if if designers and engineers

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,560
and all these people take the effort to

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,899
create an open attitude towards their

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,240
consumers the consumers on the other

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,930
hand will see all the benefits they have

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:21,089
in you know not being a consumer but

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,800
also being part of the system any other

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,740
questions on that thread any other

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,810
comments you want an audience with

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:33,779
another question okay I wanted to ask

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,810
our mind to talk a little bit about the

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:39,540
the Linux defenders model and what that

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:44,010
means how that relates to protecting in

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,540
fostering innovation so I actually have

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,880
a whole talk about that and just after

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:52,920
lunch break what we what we mostly want

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
to do is many developers care a lot

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,880
about patents and patent threats and

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,649
what we must what we want to do is just

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,089
to give them a means to do something

00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,010
about it I know that most most

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,290
developers they

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,330
it's not the dick dislike patterns they

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,280
hate them with a passion they loathe

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,830
them they would rather just see them

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,790
just go away as go away with all that

00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:18,380
crap so we met we at the open invention

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,330
at work who I also work for we know that

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,300
that's not a really realistic option

00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:28,050
unfortunately so we're just wanting to

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,980
give them them a tool to work on to be

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:35,160
able to you know counter that threat of

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,110
it just like copyleft was a great hack

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,790
and copyright this stuff that we were

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,980
doing with linux defenders will be a

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,330
great hack on the patent system so

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,760
that's what we were where we want to do

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,380
we want to give you a tool to work

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,710
around all kinds of patent threats and

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:53,010
make the world now it is a little bit

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,840
easier to do for two more protect your

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,510
freedom to operate around linux and open

00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,540
source that's mostly what we want to do

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,840
it's a lot of work it's it's a challenge

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,550
because there are many people who

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,290
actually like patent so there's a lot of

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,760
resistance there's a lot of people who

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,800
hate patterns so there's a lot of

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,090
resistance from them we're a bit in a

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,240
Robin between a rock and a hard place

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:21,120
but it's still fun any questions or

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:27,630
follow up on that yeah up top we'll get

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:29,130
you a mic just a second thank you just

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,560
curious would you consider that all

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,450
patents are bad or specific some patents

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,060
for example was you recently exposed to

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:41,010
some food patents namely Monsanto and

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,330
I'm obviously aware of software patents

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,020
but would you consider that all patents

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,490
are bad for example utility patents and

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,620
design patents I guess we have a

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,620
designer here just curious

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,589
so open invention network only deals

00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:05,410
with software patents and open invention

00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:08,619
network itself is so for its patent

00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,790
agnostic we work with pro patent people

00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:17,199
and closer oh but then there will be a

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:22,259
lot more feedback oh thank you so we are

00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:24,970
we are patent agnostic and what we do is

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,999
we work with pro patent people we work

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:36,730
with anti patent people still a lot of

00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:38,679
feedback so we work with probate and pro

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,869
patent people anti-pattern people and

00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:46,420
what we mostly care about is getting rid

00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:51,100
of the we care most leave us feedback

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:53,049
yeah we mostly care about getting rid of

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,629
the bad quality software patents right

00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:57,220
now so bad quality software patents are

00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,740
things like where there's prior art

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:09,089
where they're trivial and so on for the

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:12,220
other patents not by business so

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,860
basically if that would be the job of

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,660
typically a corporation that wants to

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,490
procure the patent they would invalidate

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,189
then do things like that but in fact

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:27,009
your organization invalidates patents

00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:28,749
based on legal reasons they are there

00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,600
was prior art as you said or other such

00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:33,639
things is that correct get that while we

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,899
do is some stuff with in validating

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,899
patents be mostly

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:57,140
so like this ooh no feedback no feedback

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:59,420
thank you that's a great hack so if it

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,080
doesn't work we put it closer I should

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:05,450
remember that yeah definitely but most

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,630
hacks are counterintuitive right that

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,210
that's what makes makes them great hacks

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,610
we do we sometimes work with in

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,920
validating we sometimes work on in

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,730
validating patterns but mostly will we

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,010
try to work within the system so what I

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,590
will tell tell about this more after the

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,330
break but what we do is we have a

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,720
massive cross-licensing pool of

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,610
companies pledging non-aggression or we

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,470
say you know don't sue on these packages

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,240
and then you get the same grant from

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,640
other companies plus you get an

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,810
unlimited patent license grant from us

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,440
and what we mostly try to do is also

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:47,210
make sure that developer is that they

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,610
that they document their inventions as

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,070
prior art so no new patterns can be

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,930
granted on those inventions that's what

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,270
we care about most let's--oh but it's

00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:02,210
not about just invalidating patterns but

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,760
the i think is one issue now as far as i

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:08,960
know i know the u.s. recently joined up

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,600
with a first-to-file it's not first to

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,370
conceive but first a file so this seems

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,600
to be very difficult for organization

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:20,210
because what is prior art that is for

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,870
example documented published is not

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,640
first filed hence that would be very

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,500
difficult to defend in the US court in

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,060
the US right now has ugly things like

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,730
dmca and while numerous patents etc so I

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,470
just curious how you feel it will be in

00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,600
the future which was recently passed I

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,700
think within two months ago they just

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,460
ruled and now the US Patent Office has

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,990
changed to first a file yeah so first of

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,120
all I'm not an American so I don't care

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,520
that much about US law that second of

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,460
all add the US was the only country to

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,110
have I do not have first the file so the

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,850
rest of the world already had first a

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,589
fall so it's just it's more

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,300
of a synchronization thing with the rest

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,839
of the world then something really

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,699
really shocking when you talk about

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,500
documentation for example someone

00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:12,019
creating an idea software etc then the

00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,779
first-to-file in the whole world's

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:17,990
falling first-to-file I guess now then

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,550
if someone does document something is it

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,110
considered prior art in the

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,399
first-to-file system I guess that's the

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,680
question I don't know if it works like

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,110
that what we do is we what we actually

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,300
do we put it in a database with a notary

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,110
digital notary which and that database

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,730
is being searched by the many patent

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,339
offices around the world including US

00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:44,600
patent office so that does count as

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:46,610
prior art for sure it's not kind of

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,360
curious boss out of how this all this

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:52,160
discussion of copywriting and that sort

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,009
of stuff prior art all those concepts

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,149
how does that apply to the the physical

00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,870
world and the things that you work with

00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:02,120
in your area well that that's what

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,649
becomes really complicated because one

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,089
of the things we've been looking at and

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,400
one of the things you see happening

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,919
right now is that people apply all kinds

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,380
of creative comments and GPL licenses to

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,079
for example blueprint you know cad/cam

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:18,919
files when you look at all 3d printer

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:24,380
movement instructables you know makers

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:27,620
they all use these systems on on their

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,330
files their virtual stuff and that's

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,070
right on the intellectual property level

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,780
but when you're looking when you go into

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,809
the fit when you really make the product

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,299
you get into you know a totally new area

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:40,309
because then you have form rights you

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:42,500
have patents you have all but patents is

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:46,130
still on that virtual set but the phone

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:50,090
right specifically is is is a tricky one

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,100
because it's on every jurist you're so

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,630
many jurisdictions every country has its

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:58,370
own way of dealing with with the

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:01,490
physical matter so it could be in a

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,990
situation where you license a Creative

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,980
Commons license you know fully

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:10,620
accessible stuff on

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,630
of your one of your designs but then if

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,299
the design is protected by law you

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,330
wouldn't be able to make it so we have

00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:20,850
the design we can adjust the design but

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,320
you will never be able to really do

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,549
something with it so that's that's kind

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,799
of a weird situation that's what we're

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,299
working on with Creative Commons to see

00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,640
if Creative Commons is actually

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,530
applicable and and if we can change it

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,510
into something that's that would be

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,630
applicable to something is called open

00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,210
design and you weave away for example

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,990
the right or you have a weaver based on

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:46,290
you know i'm not going to apply for foam

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,250
rights or that kind of stuff so it

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,590
sounds like there's a there's a

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,360
distinction between that the virtual

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,210
elements of the design the description

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,150
of the thing and then the physical

00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:00,360
instantiation is yet something else

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:03,270
completely separate okay hey our third

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,830
panelist has joined us so why don't you

00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:08,100
come on up here let's have you introduce

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,410
yourself and join us up front thank you

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,669
very much I'm terribly sorry

00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,770
unfortunately no one told me actually

00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:17,100
that I was scheduled for the panel I was

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:19,049
just showing into picky yeah I actually

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,820
came by to see because I was interested

00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:22,890
in hearing what the panel had to say so

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,080
now I find myself on it immediately I

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,020
was just an interesting experience so

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,440
hello every hello everybody my name is

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,700
Gail clever i am the founder former

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,280
president of the Free Software

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,990
Foundation Europe which I ran until 2009

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,570
I've done a couple of things around free

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,690
software open standards ODF and so on

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:45,929
and so forth I've been quite involved in

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,580
the Oh XML standardization the ODF

00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:50,160
issues and so on and so forth in these

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,020
days i'm running a free software company

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,750
which is called up systems so we are a

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,490
hundred percent open-source none'a

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,470
propriety open core or anything like

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,160
that do group we're so productivity

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,020
stuff boring things I guess to some but

00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:07,440
actually quite central to quite a few

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:11,210
people and we try to free that domain

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,210
now in practice for everyone

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,730
well thanks for joining us anybody have

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:26,820
a question out in the audience there

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:28,680
yeah get you a mic jerk could you tell

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,420
us what's the difference between free

00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:37,200
software and open source software a

00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:45,570
bunch of letters ultimately the the two

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:48,180
are the same it's a branding and

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,510
marketing question which one you prefer

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,040
in the end of the day the whole free

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,440
software terminology dates back to the

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,260
80s which is when FSF and Richard

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,540
Stallman were pushing this defining it

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,550
through the Four Freedoms you know you

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:07,350
study share improve and ultimately

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,020
through those freedoms defined what they

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,880
meant by free software there were then

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,650
people who said well but in English free

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
software sounds like it's gratis you

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,590
know we want to build a business upon

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,420
this we have a problem here we want to

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,940
communicate differently can't you find

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,980
different terms and then there was a

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,870
whole flurry of terms invented I mean

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,750
there was a Libra software which

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,150
combined like the logical leap hood you

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,630
know the the the Spanish and Italian and

00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,120
so on roots of the word into a new term

00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:38,130
same definition then Debbie and had the

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,090
free software guidelines because they

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,110
were following the free software

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:45,510
terminology in 97 I think they were

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,190
publishing this and in 98 then Bruce

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,200
parents took the Debian free software

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,150
guidelines and just did a search and

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,680
replace on them for free software

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,600
replace it by open source and made that

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,900
the definition of the open source

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,970
definition and thus defining the term

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,710
open source so it's actually and at the

00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,420
time there was even in the faq of the

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,550
open source initiative that this is just

00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,990
a marketing exercise every branding the

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,690
same substance and so on and so forth

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,880
just different style of marketing so

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,990
ultimately all of this was meant to

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,820
always be the same unfortunately some of

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,830
the protagonists didn't get along very

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,159
well

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,080
and were feeling that some of these

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,990
terms had the wrong emphasis on the

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:37,320
wrong on the wrong issues where equating

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:39,779
communication with substance and there

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,640
was a whole long flame war that has

00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,440
lasted until today that made people

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,940
believe these two are somehow different

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,519
so if you find all these weird

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,380
interpretations of free software's only

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,240
copy left and open sources everything

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:56,130
else as well and so on that's nonsense

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,500
for all intents and purposes the two are

00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,389
the same there's sometimes someone

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,190
disagrees about whether that definition

00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:04,110
applied to that particular license

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,570
really means that that license meets the

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,809
definition but then that is always to be

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:12,330
expected i mean this level of human

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,669
discussion and dialogue is always there

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,279
but for ninety-nine point nine percent

00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,419
it's the same so it is your personal

00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,789
choice which term you prefer I myself

00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,590
like the software freedom expression I

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,889
think that actually gets it across very

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:31,260
well I like that term I'm still used to

00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,610
calling it free software but I use free

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,049
software and open source almost

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:36,269
interchangeably depending on the

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:37,440
audience whether I believe that they

00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,240
actually have heard one or the other

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,779
first so I try to pick them up where

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,000
they are and for me it is about freedom

00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,320
it's the defining momentum but every

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,460
open-source guy will tell you that as

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,039
well so in the end don't get too hung up

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,919
about the terminology it's actually the

00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:01,769
freedom that is behind it that makes the

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:03,870
difference anybody want to debate on

00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:08,159
that point that seems like it's a hotly

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,470
debated topic but I actually I tend to

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,880
agree with you it's the freedom and it

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:17,639
matters it's the it's the core

00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,409
regardless yeah so there is the

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:21,120
criticism that openness has been so

00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:23,159
abused that it's hard to even quantify

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,850
what it is anymore right it's open

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,799
everything you know no matter where you

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,450
go everything somehow suddenly open and

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,029
Microsoft's also open they're all open

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,700
right open is such a friendly fuzzy word

00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:36,490
everyone loves it and there is no push

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,800
back to

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,690
views of the term either which is why

00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,150
you have you know open core which is

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,950
effectively I mean you if you stretch

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:48,340
that definition Microsoft is an open

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,110
core company because they use lots of

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,420
PSD right and they put all sorts of

00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,030
stuff around it so they have an open

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,530
core it's just a very tiny core so the

00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:02,290
question is how big does that core have

00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:04,510
to be it's it's difficult I mean for me

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:08,650
now professionally I have to say I wish

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:10,809
there was some form of understanding and

00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,059
push back to protect the companies that

00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:16,210
actually do provide freedom to their

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:18,610
customers I mean zuza does that redhead

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,020
works to do it we work to do it there's

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,420
other companies in the field that really

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,309
tried to make sure the customer at the

00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,100
end of the day has the freedom that we

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:29,110
promised them a lot of companies don't

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,490
do that they still call themselves open

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:38,740
I personally find that upsetting to say

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:41,020
it mildly because it destroys a very

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,730
important part of who we are in our

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,640
communication capabilities we can no

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,620
longer tell the lame man what makes us

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,960
different from them and I think that's a

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,790
massive marketing problem so I would

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,850
really like to see those new proprietary

00:25:51,790 --> 00:26:00,250
guys be called what they are neo

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:02,170
proprietary or proprietary and I mean

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,600
they can be proprietary don't get me

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,640
wrong I'm not telling that they don't

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,020
have the right to call them to to be

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,350
proprietary but they shouldn't call

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,750
themselves open source of free software

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,210
that's mislabeling it's misleading the

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,040
user the consumer the person who buy

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,690
something from them and believes they

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,840
now bought something that gave them

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,540
freedom only 25 find out 23 years later

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,490
that that actually isn't true and that

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,220
is the part that annoys me so I think we

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,490
may have to have a debate around how do

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:37,300
we protect that marketing core that you

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:39,700
know communication core value but that

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,950
is not so much a matter of terminology I

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,510
guess it's more a matter of all of us

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,020
standing together to actually make sure

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:50,210
we get the message right you know I

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:53,430
think with the growing

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:57,300
emergence of open source and its success

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:59,160
in all kinds of areas of cross

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,430
technology I think it's become more and

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:05,790
more attractive to closed companies to

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,310
co-opt the term openness because it's

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,620
perceived as being valuable people value

00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:13,560
choice they value openness and so I

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,460
think it's often co-opted and in use so

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,840
it is a big challenge for us in the open

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,540
source business and in other areas of

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,420
openness to protect that that's going to

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:30,060
be a challenge any comments from you

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:32,160
guys on that whole thread I really agree

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:36,120
on the marketing value of these things

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,540
as well but one of them you know that

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,760
looking at the phone we work and we're

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,680
working on a fair trade fair fair phone

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,350
in the phone is called fair and what's

00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,690
fair it's even worse you might say you

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,640
know open is like okay you have an idea

00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,350
but fair is even like it becomes really

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,480
philosophical and culturally determined

00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:00,930
but one of the things you do know is is

00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,970
that if you say something is closed then

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,550
it's you know people feel something on

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:10,950
you know open is undetermined but closed

00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:12,840
is very determined like unfair is very

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,870
determined people know what everybody

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,640
knows what unfair is nobody can exactly

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,790
say what's fair is but everybody knows

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,090
you know like you said that's not fair

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:26,370
so maybe if you switch it around and

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,370
look at look at look at it from that

00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,900
perspective like openness of course you

00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:33,800
know it's it's it's a term listen

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,230
terminology which has been kind of

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,120
scattered around everything but on the

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,070
other hand I think it's also really

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,600
important to keep focus on to not just

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,420
say well we're going to find another

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,540
term and and you know we have to we have

00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:54,780
to fill also responsible too low to put

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,910
meaning into that openness as being the

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,220
first ones to you know put meaning into

00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,630
it and not just leave it there as you

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,090
say well it's not interesting anymore

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,700
because marketing-wise it

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:08,710
work anymore so I think you know it's

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:13,340
it's hard but I agree but it's it's also

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:16,460
well there's one imminent problem here

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:19,100
and I think michael has that too as

00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,049
companies you can run around say bar but

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,900
you are closed boo I mean negative

00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:26,179
statements around the other participants

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:32,179
in the market and not necessarily good

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:34,039
marketing so we try to positively

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:37,159
distinguish ourselves where we can write

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:42,100
that means we need to have a word that

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:44,390
says what we are that we can use in our

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,220
communications that the other person

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,340
ideally cannot use because they don't

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,360
meet the criteria of using that term and

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:57,580
open has lost a bit of that which for me

00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,500
is to some extent a problem I mean

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,919
especially in my field most of the

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,779
competition is new proprietary yet has

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:14,960
no qualms over calling themselves open

00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:17,200
this and open that okay any questions

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,279
out there in the audience any other

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,279
topics you guys want to throw out yeah

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:29,750
mmm I'm not exactly sure who of you is

00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:31,520
going to answer my question if I

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,940
remember rightly somebody was talking

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,149
about the cases when companies were

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:40,610
using a GPL licensed code in their

00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:47,690
proprietary software can you give us

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:49,700
some examples how many hours do you want

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,600
me to give examples there plant there

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:57,230
plenty of companies who are using GPL

00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,380
suffer in all of their products I think

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,330
that was insane wasn't it Gardner who

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,000
did a year's study a few years ago that

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:10,340
says but ninety percent of companies

00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,899
would be using open source right now by

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:15,200
now it should be our night their

00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:15,890
favorite right yeah so I can I could

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,170
just

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,960
pick any name out there who is using GPL

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,960
software even Microsoft and a day they

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,660
shipped GPL suffer for a long long time

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,550
GPL compliant as well but it's you know

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,760
it is going to just go into any

00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:34,280
electronic store just point at a router

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,990
it's I think it's seventy percent likely

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,050
that there's GPL suffer and sometimes

00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:41,870
more than seventy percent likely so any

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:44,450
big brand out there is using GPL suffer

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,130
whether they do it GPL complaint or not

00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:54,410
that's a whole different issue that I'm

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:57,080
dealing with on a daily basis so the

00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,420
correct question would be do they use it

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,370
in a way what are the cases where they

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,340
use it in a way which doesn't comply

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,990
with the license I must say that the big

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,530
guys they they generally get it the

00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:12,730
companies like Cisco netgear companies

00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:15,680
they do get it they actually have people

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,030
going through all of their source and

00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,100
all that and work they're working very

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,520
actively also with upstream projects to

00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:25,610
make sure that that that goes well what

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,940
doesn't go well white box just go into

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,040
dino alibaba.com the website it's

00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,840
fantastic you just go there alibaba.com

00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,510
and you can buy anything from anywhere

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,100
in any quantity that you like not for it

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,200
not for any price but you can get some

00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,420
really good deals and if you just search

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,730
there and you see what what what often

00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,440
happens is the companies that sell here

00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,750
in the shops there they're fairly small

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,700
you get a few marketeers and that's it

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,820
they don't have any engineers few

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,710
marketeers director a sales guy that's

00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,510
it and what they did it they just

00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:00,320
literally go through a catalog and say I

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,750
want that device in blood they're chua

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,180
lino often no contracts about things

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,100
like copyrights and nothing and that's

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,960
where it goes wrong and you don't you

00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,440
should not underestimate the amount of

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,650
devices that comes onto the market that

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,930
way it's a lot it's billions and

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,810
millions of devices per month in Europe

00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:23,420
alone so that's where it goes wrong in

00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:26,510
Seoul where it actually goes wrong is

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,149
companies in the Far East who make these

00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:32,299
devices ship it off to Europe and

00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:34,820
it's just relabeled and they don't get

00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,950
it how it works they say you know a bit

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,099
actually they see you know free software

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:43,639
gratis you can just reuse it just slap

00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:45,529
it on there done well and they don't

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:47,809
understand that there is another extra

00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:49,879
extra obligations oh and because they

00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:51,440
don't ship to the end consumer like us

00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:53,629
where we can put where we can have legal

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,399
actions well it's their consumers

00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:57,619
problem and they might just do one

00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:59,239
one-off business deal and then they move

00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,580
on to a different supplier that's how it

00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:04,099
works it's frustrating but that's how it

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,190
works so what do you do what are steps

00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:09,710
when you realize somebody's so there are

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,899
a few individuals and companies who

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:15,230
actually do GPL license enforcement that

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:17,750
differs per jurisdiction so in the u.s.

00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,329
there for example FSF has done

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,510
enforcement software freedom Conservancy

00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,369
has enforcement as done enforcement in

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,129
Germany how old that he is done

00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:31,909
enforcement with GPL violation store org

00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:34,429
and I know very well how that works well

00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,710
usually what happens he goes to a shop

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,859
or online shop makes a test purchase

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,029
verifies there's a there's a violation

00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,460
then it's lawyer send a cease-and-desist

00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,829
letter basically say you have to stop

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,779
doing this or we'll take your product of

00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,109
the market and taking it off the market

00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:53,960
includes things like no more

00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:56,329
advertisement pie well usually not

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,890
confiscation of the other supplies but I

00:34:56,329 --> 00:35:02,000
know that in the u.s. they tried to do

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:04,099
that you know just and maker and he will

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,750
just bring on the pain most companies

00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:07,819
don't want the pain they just say all

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,720
right so we didn't know we acted in good

00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:13,339
faith we want to be able to fix that

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,099
very few cases actually go to court I

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:21,020
think in a lot since 2005 we've solved

00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:23,450
several hundred cases with using lawyers

00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,250
and also several hundred cases where we

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:30,230
did not use lawyers but only mailed the

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,880
company say guys wrong fix it and that's

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,760
usually how we do it it's a lot of work

00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,859
it's very frustrating i can tell you but

00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,789
it's and that's by putting pressure on

00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:42,950
the on the companies here in Europe we

00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:45,560
try to get into the supply chain

00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,930
and get into it and fix it there one

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,060
layer up and then one other layer up and

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,770
then one other layer up sometimes you

00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,570
have to go really really far if you know

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,880
how many companies are involved in put

00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,670
just making one device sometimes it's

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:04,510
five six layers deep you have to fix it

00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:07,160
at every step so the it is it if

00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:09,200
somebody is producing some some hardware

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,530
which is using which is having some

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,829
firmware in it and the firmware has a

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:19,640
GPL licensed code who what is the proper

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:22,640
way to do it I mean does it mean the

00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:28,400
company can't sell the I mean the

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:32,030
rooters are I mean people consider

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,510
Reuters hardware so they think they are

00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:38,599
buying or maybe the the producer thinks

00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,520
he's selling the hardware and he's not

00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,609
not charging anything for the software

00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,530
well yeah that's that's indeed a problem

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:47,420
I've talked to hardware vendors and I

00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,849
said you know what suffer is running out

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,560
said no it's not suffer because in his

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:57,170
mind software was something you download

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:59,180
from pirate bay so yeah that that is a

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,910
big big issue that people don't see that

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,680
software is basically everywhere I mean

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,660
there there there tons of companies out

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,640
there that are basically they think of

00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,220
themselves as soft as hardware companies

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,960
but there are software companies klm is

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,470
selling Android tablets in their own

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,940
airplanes klm is a software company

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,550
almost everyone out there is a software

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:25,369
company these days but they don't

00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:27,109
realize it yet I know that that's kind

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,829
of confusing that's what the companies

00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:34,310
think as well it is it is it is a very

00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:36,970
tough problem to in to handle and it is

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,650
difficult we can talk about that later

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:42,200
just curious made me think about you

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:43,700
know your work is obviously involved it

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,630
sounds like something like penetrating

00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,310
organized crime and you know one of the

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:54,090
ways organized crime shields itself is

00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:57,420
by layers and outside people and such so

00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:59,610
I feel your pain a bit but I want to

00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,470
understand is when you do approach these

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:03,600
companies and you say they are compliant

00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,270
it's very convenient for a person to

00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,210
admit that oh we didn't know it's a

00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,100
common practice but in fact there's

00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,950
still damages done there's still a lot

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,990
of good hearted open source coders that

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,510
have to dedicate a tremendous amount of

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:23,340
time over pizza and coca-cola to to

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:24,870
write this stuff and and yet from my

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,810
outside experience it seems like

00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:31,350
corporations at different levels at many

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:33,630
levels get away with get away with this

00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:35,550
by just saying oh well yeah will cease

00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:39,630
and desist it's not enough I'm just

00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:42,330
curious do you do you charge any damages

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:45,990
does it does it ever see I don't know I

00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:48,420
don't know how it's its remedied and in

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,250
so in Europe it's a bit hard at least in

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,600
civil law systems it's a bit hard to sue

00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,820
for damages that's what least what

00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,560
Harold well does lawyers told me but

00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,230
according to in German law there is a

00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,130
very convenient contractual penalty that

00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,810
you can put into a in end into a season

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,240
desist letter so if they if they sign is

00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:08,130
a declaration to cease and desist by

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,370
German law there has to be a penalty in

00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,820
there and each time they divide late DD

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:17,070
agreement the penalty goes up and that

00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,940
can that can cause a significant amount

00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:23,460
of pain there is actually one company

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:26,750
you let pay so much that was cheaper to

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,520
hire a lawyer hire a lawyer full time

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,890
but even when the cease and desist a

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,110
letter falls upon their lap there's

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:38,220
already been a plenty of time that's

00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:40,470
eroded the I don't know what we call it

00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,040
the honor or the open source agreement

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,480
so that time they've profited that time

00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,780
they've damaged the open source

00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,450
community will have you or to honor a

00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:54,690
GPL so by the time the cease-and-desist

00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:58,260
letter it falls upon their lap are they

00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:00,360
charged damages then that depends on the

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,730
case and I I should defer that question

00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,560
to the lawyers who are not here right

00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,750
now I don't know all the details about

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,740
that I'm I mostly involved with the

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,510
engineering finally

00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,650
evidence shooting enough to the lawyers

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:16,860
and let them handle all that stuff one

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:19,619
comment on that though since I've been

00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:21,380
involved in the meta discussion with the

00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,090
lawyers about these issues and

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,450
ultimately the question is I mean ask

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:30,060
yourself what is the goal right is your

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,740
goal to make it so painful to use free

00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,140
software that companies will say no no

00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,180
no I'm not touching the or is your

00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,369
goal to make it possible for them to

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,890
engage with the free software community

00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:42,740
in a way that works for everyone so our

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,090
software gets used on those devices

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,280
there's a balance to be struck here

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:49,290
which clearly shouldn't just say yeah

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,820
yeah sure you know yeah we know we put

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,830
that license on there you can just

00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,930
ignore it that we clearly shouldn't do

00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,300
but I would also say we also shouldn't

00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,220
go like on oh you know I'm gonna sue you

00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,740
for your farm and the other farm and

00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:06,380
your neighbors farm as well because you

00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,380
had the audacity to use my software

00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:28,700
Andre the building probably will not

00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,700
explode

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:50,080
he just did you gotta go but yeah so so

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,580
just from a overall perspective I mean

00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,280
can understand that you're upset about

00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:56,830
the fact that they just use the software

00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,070
without applying respecting the license

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:01,600
that people have put on it and you're

00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:04,630
emotionally is not a good thing at the

00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,960
same time most software developers write

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,580
software because they wanted to be used

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,310
so you need to find a way to make it

00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,290
possible for them to do this right in a

00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,810
way that actually economically works for

00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,910
everyone so they can still push all

00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,290
devices in ways that actually make them

00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,930
money because otherwise they wouldn't do

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,490
it so you need to find a way to somehow

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,230
balance those interests and that's a

00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:29,440
tricky act I mean Shane's been doing

00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,030
this for a long time as well so I

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,590
suggest that you actually have a chat

00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:36,520
with him because he now lives in the

00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:39,700
hotbed of hardware manufacturing if if

00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,800
you know the all these questions around

00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:48,490
those imbalances are of interest to you

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,200
I just like to note that I'm d ha the

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,330
margins for the hardware manufacturers

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,560
like if you put out these devices they

00:42:52,330 --> 00:43:03,790
aren't all that big they exactly that

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:05,740
tiny just to respond to your argument

00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,660
it's not that I want to you know make

00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,340
them stop but it was as simple as

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,560
including a small sheet of paper that

00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:14,110
says this is GPL if you wish to request

00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,690
a source code you can etc but they don't

00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:18,850
even go that far and that's where the

00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,410
the damage is done they just need to

00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:22,750
include a small piece of paper or some

00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,220
information that allows the end user to

00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,660
acquire the source code and go there

00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,290
after i'm speaking about GPL in this

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:31,120
case so i would imagine it'd be

00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:34,030
deliberate the software the firmware

00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,340
that runs on their hardware is acquired

00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:39,970
either through some real time compiler

00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:42,100
they have to pay for or they are

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:44,470
downloading it in which the license is

00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,460
there in plain whatever multiple

00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:50,230
languages so I don't I don't I'm not

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,880
saying they can't use it but again they

00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,220
need to adhere that

00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,440
it didn't get there for free and it's

00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,900
equal to the hardware as far as value if

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,990
not sometimes in some cases more and

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:08,330
it's just basically being good stewards

00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:10,120
of I don't know property set so as I

00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,370
said in response to an earlier question

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:16,220
yes that's how it should be done but the

00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,860
company is whose news whose name is on

00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,960
the box and who are actually liable they

00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,900
just buy everything prefab the real

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,060
problem is is upstream and yes of course

00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,280
companies whose name is on the box they

00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,550
often don't check because they don't

00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,890
know how it is it is actually pretty

00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:35,090
difficult for for these companies to

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,010
check these things like hey

00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:39,290
telemarketing like yeah i just opened VI

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,990
and just look through the firmer which

00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:47,030
is what I do but and they just go what

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:48,680
firmer VI that's not so I offer what I

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,480
found in the last seven years of

00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,150
compliance engineering is most of them

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,800
have actually acted on good faith they

00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,410
should be doing more the real problem is

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,210
definitely more upstream and that it

00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:02,450
that is very very difficult and

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:06,130
difficult to check so I mean that's

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:09,230
difficult to fix these companies they

00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:11,360
basically like any big industry it works

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:14,480
a lot different than what you think how

00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,250
it actually works I did some work in the

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,920
food industry I can tell you completely

00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,540
different than what you think you don't

00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,920
want to know you definitely don't want

00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,990
to know it i T and the Consumer

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,140
Electronics is the same nothing nothing

00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:30,080
is what it what it seems it is it is

00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,820
very very difficult just talk just go

00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:35,930
into one of those companies and talk to

00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:37,910
them hear their actual stories it

00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,500
doesn't excuse that they violate the GPL

00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,510
but it is it's all a little bit more

00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,240
it's actually a lot more complicated

00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,220
than this just what he said about the

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,130
margins if you just go to the shop and

00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:53,630
buy a 40 year old router how much do you

00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:55,160
think goes to the shop seriously how

00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,720
much do you think goes to the show I as

00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,810
far as I understand it's I think their

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,540
march is about four percent four percent

00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:05,390
profit yeah so how much of that is bull

00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:09,490
it about half of the

00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:13,580
it goes to goes to the shop so the idea

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:15,430
and the shop pays about 20 euros for

00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,410
that 20 euros everything has to be made

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:21,890
printed shipped from from for example

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:23,720
Taiwan to Europe and most of the cost in

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,020
there are actually only all things like

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:30,560
you know hardware chips all that natural

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:33,890
cost of software that's so that's almost

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,930
zero so they have something which you

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,880
just use as a commodity and they have

00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,070
and they don't pay anything for it and

00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,890
then they is have to check it the

00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,450
software isn't the real cost I mean

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,940
maybe that's how the industry works it's

00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:50,840
 yeah I know maybe maybe the these

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,330
solution is I don't know maybe letting

00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,100
go telling government to tell industry

00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,810
retail and otherwise to be more aware of

00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,210
what they're buying a broad that they

00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,250
are in fact responsible as long as I

00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,960
know that then I think that kind of

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,930
education is valuable that I don't think

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,020
anyone running a business selling

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:11,330
electronics can be can actually not know

00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:12,770
that there may be software involved you

00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,960
sign a license with just about every

00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,670
piece of equipment any piece of

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,210
intelligent equipment has some license

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:23,300
attached to it about the software inside

00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:25,070
so I I'm not trying to be a hardliner

00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,900
yearly I totally agree with I'm just

00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:29,990
saying very very hard they really need

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,060
to be more responsible more better

00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,340
stewards maybe comes from governments

00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:36,860
telling people look you're importing be

00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,440
aware you know whatever you're you're

00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,810
using white box etc that there may be

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,810
something involved in your importation

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:47,540
because as you mentioned in the u.s. if

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,910
there's some infraction if the lawyers

00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:52,310
do their job right the container will

00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:53,870
stop at the docks and then it's either

00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:56,660
destroyed or I don't know sent back at

00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:59,020
their at their cost whatever I don't

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:02,900
know how it works in Europe are

00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,960
elsewhere but i imagine that business

00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:08,720
would have that same amount of power or

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:13,070
let's say an organization you know to to

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,720
such damages or infraction i wish i wish

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,980
it were that simple I've been to I've

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,020
been doing this for the last seven years

00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,930
it's very very difficult and

00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,970
we've made quite a few successes not as

00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,860
much as I would help but I still

00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:29,120
continuing your fight but it is very

00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:30,590
very difficult thank you so we've got a

00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,350
little bit of time left and I wanted to

00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:35,720
introduce another topic threat here and

00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,770
get some questions going on it and one

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,800
of the things that really distinguishes

00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,390
open source software that's so

00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,180
interesting to me and I think to you

00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:47,270
guys as well is the blurring of the line

00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,490
between creator and consumer right where

00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,800
there there's an opportunity to be one

00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,410
in the same or to cross those lines and

00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,820
I'd be interested to hear boss from you

00:48:54,410 --> 00:49:00,830
for example in your world how does that

00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:04,340
concept of creator consumer and the

00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:06,410
blurring of those lines work in to fit

00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:11,290
into the things that you're doing with

00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:14,590
your labs well first of all I think it's

00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:17,330
yeah it's you can compare these things

00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,250
especially from the when you look at the

00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,160
fabrication laboratories where you see

00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:25,940
where computation and you know the bits

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,980
and atoms kind of come together it's it

00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,070
becomes easier also to work

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,660
collaboratively on products one of the

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,130
things I see in the lab we have in

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,850
Amsterdam is that people come there

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:39,440
really come there to create their own to

00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,790
create their own devices to create their

00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,220
own stuff to create their own designs

00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:46,040
that means that people are both the

00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:48,260
designer and the consumer of the other

00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,780
stuff they they make so that what we we

00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,570
call that personal fabrication the nice

00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,280
thing about that is that you see I had

00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:58,340
this guy in the lab working on a

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,990
wheelchair at door step climber he was

00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:01,970
in a wheelchair and he couldn't go into

00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,910
houses a lot of the houses in Amsterdam

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:09,620
have really high I call this door steps

00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:10,970
and so he went in and together with with

00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,790
the help of other people who got

00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:16,040
interested in what he was doing he made

00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,780
a caterpillar for his wheelchair to be

00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,370
able to climb up you know the electric

00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,750
wheelchair to climb up these doors that

00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:27,170
and there is no industry at this point

00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:29,150
who provides him with something like a

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,260
Dorset primer specifically for his

00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,900
wheelchair

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,480
and what what was really nice to see is

00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:38,750
that and I like that with open source

00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:41,150
software as well that there isn't that

00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:44,300
doesn't exist a niche which you can't

00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,130
fill up with you know the needs through

00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,320
open source software or open source

00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:51,440
hardware or if you give people the means

00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,450
the knowledge and the community to be

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,220
able to create this they they will come

00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:58,430
up with solutions for their own needs

00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:01,520
and these needs make them both you know

00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:03,470
the designer and their consumer and

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,000
that's really interesting to see in

00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:10,100
hardware as well anybody have any

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,870
thoughts or questions on that like

00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,810
that's just an interesting area where it

00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:17,050
if you think about the spirit of

00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:19,640
openness and what it means that that

00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:23,270
ability to be both creator and consumer

00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,890
seems like a central theme any other

00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:30,740
questions comments out there we've got

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:32,420
about three or four minutes left okay

00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,580
any final words from you guys do you

00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:43,450
want to share some final comments we'll

00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:46,250
start out of his end well yeah like

00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:57,640
final words sometimes tend to be so

00:51:46,250 --> 00:52:00,320
final I don't know ultimately I think

00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,740
the challenges we currently face are

00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:08,380
that we need to somehow focus and grow

00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:14,990
our message in our community and

00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:18,650
actually realize that we are no longer a

00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:21,320
fringe community the rules have changed

00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:24,080
to some extent I mean it's there's a

00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,790
point where you know 10 years ago 15

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,130
years ago we were discussing Oh wouldn't

00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:31,880
it be awesome if everyone was using this

00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:34,310
and you know we were just a small group

00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,900
of people really worldwide was getting

00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:38,030
together and we were like doing things

00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,040
but we were very excited but at the same

00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,710
time you know there was the big question

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,690
of you know

00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,660
do we get this into the mainstream well

00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:48,400
I mean we are a mainstream now and it

00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,670
creates a whole new set of challenges

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,849
and I think as a community we actually

00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:58,300
need to think about this once in a while

00:52:53,849 --> 00:53:01,960
in a sensible way to see how do we need

00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:05,109
to to adjust to the changing realities

00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:10,450
in order to not totally lose our focus

00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:13,720
because we are now dancing with quite a

00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:15,700
few Giants as well that creates its own

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:20,349
challenges it's awesome I mean that

00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:24,190
Giants can be good dancers but sometimes

00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:26,589
they also step on your feet and so

00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,960
there's a couple of things here we need

00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:32,740
to think about and what I would actually

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,540
like to encourage everyone to do is to

00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,510
you know start thinking about what is

00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,520
that world that you would like to see

00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:42,190
and start you know sharing that vision

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,170
because I think we need to bring a bit

00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,200
more vision into some of our discussions

00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:49,270
since we've had a lot of new entrants

00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,010
who came you to they say oh this is all

00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,060
exciting you know the big companies are

00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,420
here and so on and so forth that's all

00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:56,680
good but some of them no longer have the

00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,660
same background in terms of

00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,810
understanding why this was started and

00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:06,369
why this is important so perhaps that is

00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:08,890
something worthwhile considering well

00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,570
said I'd like to add to that enjoy lunch

00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:19,359
and be back for my talk in 30 minutes

00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:21,070
I'll get really sure then thanks all

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,680
right thanks everybody and thanks to our

00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:26,880
panelist for this talk and there is 30

00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,940
minutes left of lunch so enjoy

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,940
