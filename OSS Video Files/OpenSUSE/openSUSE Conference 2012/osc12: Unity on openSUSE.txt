Damon Eve enough let's begin ok welcome

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,520
all thanks for coming I wanted to show

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:23,279
you off unity for opensuse so first

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,599
let's see I want to introduce myself and

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:32,189
why I pot unity to open those up I'm

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,700
villain in daytime I work as an engineer

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:40,590
named big IT company but i'm using linux

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,480
since already 10 years at the moment I

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,180
was not satisfied with the desktop

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,570
situation in Linux and in opensuse

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:53,030
because I saw some very things I don't

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,920
like in norm chow and then caddy and

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,789
unity should be available in any case

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,340
even for some users who'd like it and

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:06,140
who only stays with a bunt 0 because of

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:10,770
unity and the software scent of course

00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:12,810
so why OBS because we have ported also

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,590
unity to fedora you may have noticed

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,650
this in the news already obvious is very

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:25,470
very great tool which made it possible

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:29,460
for us to vonage packages of opensuse

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,150
factory and from other projects inside

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,939
of OBS and to import fedora packages for

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:41,640
this the unity packages the important

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,119
ones are the upstream packages we have

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,549
their the you touch framework knocks

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,149
compass and unity which are for the

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:55,920
graphic rendering the indicators and the

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,640
bamf stuff of course we have the

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,680
overlays guava and we have some curry

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:10,979
and naan packages which in covers

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:14,210
features of unity into caddy and norm so

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:18,860
we have still you may have fell off

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:22,950
packages who require patches from

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,970
standards opens other packages this

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,730
includes gtk2 and gtk3 for the up- in

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,010
the Couture and also a bunch of non

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,220
packages like the control center the

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:40,320
settings demon the menus and the network

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,470
manager we also have the sum X of X orc

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,150
staff which are actually just required

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,490
for the panel to outer height the

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:56,070
question is here why is this not

00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:59,160
upstream while packaging this for

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:03,630
opensuse I reviewed the packages and

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:07,530
each patch has actually an upstream back

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:10,620
report and was declined for some reason

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:14,640
from genome or from the other projects

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,110
as an example for the groom control

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:23,459
center there was a patch adding a

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:26,280
feature for what to do on lid closed

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:30,410
should it suspend should I shut down and

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,440
this was declined as a patch for genome

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:43,130
because it's well too much options for

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:43,130
the fog norm so you want any screenshots

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:56,300
no let's short life maybe so let's unity

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,300
for opensuse

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:11,860
so we can prove it of course here we

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:14,980
have yest and well it's actually quite

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:21,400
everything working we have you read the

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:23,440
different lenses of course here I don't

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,680
have anything in the music collection

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,410
because that's just a fresh install so

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,230
to test that it's working on a fresh

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:39,010
install we have of course the yep money

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:43,770
here in the top working for every kind

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:54,660
of packages for the ones using no menu

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:54,660
for Cutie packages and for gtk packages

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:08,620
so may you have already noticed that

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:12,520
here in the upper corner it reloads for

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,460
a second that's actually we didn't

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,150
figure it out yet some problem is you

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,680
power because it happens only when the

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:27,000
laptop is not connected to the power

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,000
only when zone running on battery

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,610
so what actually is still not one

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,020
hundred percent working we need a

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:48,840
workaround for get EK apps to export

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,330
their up menu and it must be set with

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,600
this environment variable each time you

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,890
run the package at the moment we are

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,710
trying to figure out what's the best

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,340
practice for opensuse and fedora to

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,630
include it into the RPM package and to

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:13,530
set its system-wide like sis config or

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:17,160
some global exported variable the other

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,890
thing you see the login manager when you

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,250
when you have the g DM screen popping up

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,560
you can choose the session it already

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,830
shows the ubuntu session or unity

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:33,660
session but when you start it you get

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:39,530
the gnome shell that's because of a

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:42,750
custom part of opensuse in gdm always

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,180
especially the ignore section attends

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:49,200
it's a bit differently not vanilla when

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:55,080
they were like the gnome session starts

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:57,300
actually a file called genome which a

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,840
wrapper for if you are running on a live

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,990
CD it creates the icon and the favorite

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,050
for the life and stour and we would have

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,600
to wrap around it so we could not use

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:14,100
the gnomes or unity session for move on

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,240
to like I've mentioned before you power

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:22,770
and the battery indicator it's flashing

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,110
sometimes each about in 30 seconds but

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,730
it's no problem at all it's a problem

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:30,800
when you have when you try to use the

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:35,610
indicators in the norm classic panel

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:38,780
then it's actually crashing the panel we

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,780
have the message indicator

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:51,760
it's here quite empty because you need

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,950
also to package every single chat

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,230
program which are using the message

00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:02,620
indicator with some custom Ubuntu page

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:07,600
and we would require there some help

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:18,940
from opensuse or some supports to get

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:21,670
this into mainstream so what about the

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,190
future of this project we are of course

00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:29,470
trying to get it into factory or our

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:31,480
heights in fedora the the biggest

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,260
problem here would be for fedora for

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,150
open lose it would be quite

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:42,640
straightforward because of the use of

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:48,910
OBS we actually do the packages which

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,310
require pay patches they conflicts with

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,600
the mainstream packages and have the

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:58,870
suffix dash Ubuntu so you would have in

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,820
ended in the district gtk3 and geeky

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,650
case we you would dash you want to and

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:08,410
you can choose which one to install so

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,410
what else would there be destroyed best

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:16,840
practices of course we packaged it in

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:19,330
the norm I itano on OBS for fedora and

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,630
opensuse and we also enabled a

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,960
repository for arch maybe that's the

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:31,450
right time I didn't mention it in the

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:34,810
beginning shaolong sin is the is another

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:40,060
guy working very very much on this

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,250
project he actually was the first one

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,800
who ported unity some to some other

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:51,130
distribution he ported it to ash linux

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,140
after i found this out I what I wet on

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,540
the internet that he is switching to

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,529
fedora so I

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:04,389
dr. Tim and he said yeah well let's try

00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:06,970
to use to be OBS together and T world

00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:10,060
already some spec files I wrote some

00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:16,120
specs files for opensuse and now it's

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:21,190
working for opensuse and for fedora so

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:24,310
what about unity unity 2d it's actually

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,610
already depreciated by cannon shell for

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:31,810
your bond room but it is a very

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,230
interesting concept using the qml and it

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:41,949
it does not require llvm pipe like norm

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:44,620
shell or unity does what I'm really

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,509
interested in is you need to get unity

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,610
features into other desktop environments

00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:54,160
like KDE and gnome fall back panel we

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,040
may drop this with the norm for back

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,750
panel because it's going to be dropped

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,839
most likely in the next few months so we

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,199
will try to get it into caddy caddy

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:13,180
already has the an icon tasks plasmid

00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:17,110
and window button blah sweet you also

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,810
have the up- running into caddy what we

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:33,279
still would require is a bit polishing

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:40,899
and the the indicators and the dash any

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:44,199
questions up to here okay we have the

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:47,519
software center which is now was part of

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:52,630
the last year's google Summer of Code

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,819
and there was a very big progress so it

00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:01,839
may integrate well with newer versions

00:11:54,819 --> 00:12:05,110
of of our unity dash here yeah well

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,860
that's it may if you have some interest

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,040
I can just do a fashion style and show

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:22,470
you

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:22,470
how to install it so was this a yes

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:36,250
thank you for the presentation we will

00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:39,069
have a break for a quiet hour afterwards

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,560
we will have the presentation desktop

00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:44,019
for education and server for education

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,470
every client and server solution for

00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,470
