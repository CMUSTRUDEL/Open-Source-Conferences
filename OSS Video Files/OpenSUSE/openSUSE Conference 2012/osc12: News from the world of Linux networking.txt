00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:35,119
scosche car it isn't open a little bit

00:01:38,149 --> 00:02:03,929
like a cns Koshka the object ah muzu I

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:06,090
can't say something yeah so welcome and

00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,789
let me introduce our first speaker of

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,310
our for this afternoon mr. Parvati Murda

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,890
who works in a red hat as maintainer of

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,769
network manager package you will be

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:24,209
talking about some news from little

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:27,660
networking and network configuration ok

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:31,680
so i was already introduced that's nice

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,290
here i will be talking about mostly our

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,350
project means that work manager but i'll

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,840
be trying to speak a little bit more

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:43,680
about the current infrastructure of

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,920
linux network configuration um actually

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:52,260
i need to start with something really

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,380
low level to to work with that means you

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,290
always use Cardinal networking

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,590
infrastructure for your computers with

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,950
linux so that means even if you have

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,459
things on top of it you always need to

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,340
configure the canal itself and this can

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:15,299
be done with the IP command from the IP

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,230
out package and this way you can set up

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,880
all sorts of things with the colonel and

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,100
even some things are maintained by the

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,400
kernel itself for example if you

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,400
activate the loopback interface the AP

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,239
IP address is for both ipv6 and ipv4

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,720
protocols are and not just by the kernel

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,720
so you're not getting this is there with

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,510
this approach you

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,970
can easily put a lot of comments in a

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,250
shell script and just run them as you

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,830
would do with iptables or something like

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,470
that and you are done with some

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,200
aesthetic network configuration this is

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,200
suitable for distinct I'm doing this all

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,110
the time on networking trainings so that

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,200
we really know what's going on and this

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,210
is also usable for real use cases if you

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,070
have a very static environment and you

00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:13,200
don't need any fancy stuff that is

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:16,260
changing during the run time on top of

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,230
that you can you can put a rather tiny

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:25,140
layer over this IP out projects or

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,660
ifconfig or whatever you're using and I

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,670
had this way you can have networking

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,790
scripts that you can activate for

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:36,090
specific interfaces you can you can act

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,740
at run time for this you have various

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:43,020
configuration format and you know the

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,890
important thing is it's always the use

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:51,240
cases this is perfectly suitable for

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,760
menu addressing and stuff this is pretty

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,310
usable if you have just dhcp to connect

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,340
to your network well it's totally

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,860
unusable with the ipv6 protocol and it's

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,060
unusable if you're using multiple

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:10,229
connections using DHCP so it's really

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,080
really limited some people say that this

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:15,600
is this is enough for us but no we can't

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,570
we can't agree with that it's a it's not

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,900
possible to go any forward with just

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,450
that working scripts for us another

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:28,470
thing we would like would like to work

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:30,870
with is VPNs and DNS SEC and and stuff

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:36,720
like that so you actually need some

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:39,090
central point so that we talk about some

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,720
some specific software's and some

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:46,740
specific variants you have ifconfig or

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,140
AF CFG these are used by many

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,700
distributions including rata

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,300
distributions including Susa

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,909
distributions

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,879
and they're there they differ slightly

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:00,849
so it may be sometimes sometimes

00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:04,120
different to work with them you have a

00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:06,310
fab down for debian and ubuntu i think

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,889
this is the most flexible one of those

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:11,500
you can you can see here may be gentle

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,629
guys would disagree I don't know but you

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,530
can you can still do a lot of stuff with

00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:22,000
the DNA variants and something that

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:24,789
works for routers and for building up

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,150
more complicated networks is the UCI

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:33,789
version you see a variant for open wrt

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,030
well here knows open WR TN and you see I

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:44,500
a configuration it's pretty pretty

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:49,240
flexible isn't it so we are getting to

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:53,050
the point the conclusion of all these

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,419
things over a long time is that

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,060
networking scripts are not good enough

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,930
for us and we actually need a network

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,270
configuration demon maybe some of you

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,069
disagree is there anyone who thinks we

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,069
don't need a network configuration demon

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:18,310
mckeldin shitski as usual ok ok we are

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,919
talking about many use cases yes many

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,430
many of them can be done without it but

00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,620
if you want something to get to the end

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,529
users to the customers to virtualization

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,560
users it's pretty complicated to get

00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:39,430
over with just networking scripts or

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:41,379
something so what's the purpose of the

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,150
configuration email first it's its

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,580
configuration of the colonel it's

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:49,990
communication with all these other

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:54,550
demons so so it actually works as a

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:58,029
central point and it manages default

00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:02,900
default route device selection and and

00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:07,120
so on and dns service selection you know

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,860
so everyone really wants to have his own

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,830
network management demon so currently we

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,370
have something like six of them we have

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:18,199
network manager which is our project

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,410
network manager has some something like

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:25,639
four active people employed by redhead

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:29,539
and many contributors that send us

00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:33,110
patches time had time from Lebanon from

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:35,469
maybe Susie but that's not so often from

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:41,839
jen to yeah we have some contributors

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:45,830
but it's it's a project of ours desk on

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:50,060
man which was promoted by Intel and was

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:53,510
was programmed at was program for the

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,660
meego operating system I was actually

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,690
trying to rank on man yeah it was

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,360
possible the demon was working the

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,050
graphical user interface for genome was

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,870
sort of yeah ethernet worked when I

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,900
tried to do the wireless yeah just

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:17,420
crashed and nothing more so i could not

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,820
really use that there's the week d or VI

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,060
CD or how you want to read it there's

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,450
just a simple demon so i don't want to

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:30,950
be talking about it so long actually

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:34,070
Knox has their have their net CFG which

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,850
is something like the other demons but

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:41,870
they're trying to configure it in a more

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:45,800
shell manner so you're just preparing

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:49,640
some some shell variables and so on but

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:53,020
it looks like it might work too Nativity

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,950
is something I was really interested in

00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:00,529
it it's developed by open wrt folks and

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,990
they are trying to just extend the

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:06,950
original configuration not to not to

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,630
change it from scratch and just provide

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,290
a demon so that all the configurations

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,690
work correctly and then we have wicked

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,690
but I wouldn't be talking about this one

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:23,310
because

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:26,070
another talk about this so why are we

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,610
actually using and promoting network

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:34,200
manager currently it's that we have long

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:37,380
long history of desktop usage or maybe

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,080
rather laptop usage on wireless and so

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,820
on so originally as it was just just a

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,820
desktop thing or let the thing to

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:48,180
connect to wireless and stuff and this

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:52,560
is how it started it actually works well

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,360
with ipv6 works well does not mean it

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,150
follows all the standards it does not

00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,670
mean it reconfigures whatever you want

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,920
to because we had no time for that

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,240
actually we are working on other stuff

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:12,530
and we could not do this but it's on the

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:17,670
planet you have to have two version Oh

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:19,230
964 for good ipv6 experience and it's

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,520
under active development which is

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:26,070
something I said ready it influences

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,980
kernel development and development of

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,190
other tools because we are finding lots

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,250
of problems lots of bugs that you don't

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,340
see when you're just using command line

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:41,760
tools because these bugs are usually

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:45,150
related to timing so we are we are even

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,060
based we receive some events and react

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,430
on them and sometimes they sit this is a

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,520
problem with the kernel or with some

00:11:50,430 --> 00:12:00,980
other tools what we are trying to do is

00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:04,410
to also improve the ietf standards

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:08,460
because we found many things that we

00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:12,540
just have to choose whether to do it the

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:15,810
standard way or make it actually work so

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,120
we just make it work you just break the

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,339
standards but we are trying to get back

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:27,380
our work to the standards too and also

00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,520
that means all of these things mean that

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,820
when you are not using

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,910
dog manager you still can see some

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:41,640
improvement in the kernel that is the

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:44,940
output of our work so what's the problem

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,660
because we we have problems we admit it

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,810
you're not just just hiding in some

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,780
holes or something so network manager

00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,230
was primarily designed for desktop it

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,580
just the same ways just don't work for

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,880
so we're going to work for visualization

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,790
so this is something must be must be

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,370
covered it likes some important features

00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,920
currently it lacks preaching which is

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:15,840
for virtualization it's something you

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:18,570
just can't avoid we are working on it we

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,690
have versions that work with bridging we

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,600
are just experimenting because yeah I

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:28,230
was trying my bridging branch and it

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,560
worked on Ethernet it worked with DHCP

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:36,960
it need not work with the wireless we

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:39,930
are working on this and what what we

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,840
have as a long-term problem is that

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,110
network manager sometimes just we

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,070
announce some features then we break

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,410
them it does not work or we announce

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,630
some features test them in some specific

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,910
environment that works for us then users

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,520
come try to use it and it does not work

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm talking about this all the time with

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,120
my colleagues because i think it's it's

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:09,300
a bad way to do any development and

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:13,680
there's some output and we are going to

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:16,140
change this and the way we are going to

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,270
change it change this is a whole bunch

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:23,130
of changes we are going to do we are

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:26,460
redesigning the whole platform

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,520
interaction stuff that means interaction

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,320
with colonel and you deaf we are

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,130
actually rewriting this from scratch

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:39,530
because there's just no other way to do

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:43,170
it right we are trying to put together

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:46,889
some hacks that we use to avoid

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:50,790
or workaround Colonel bucks we are

00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:53,730
trying to work around some library

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:57,420
compatibility stuff because we are still

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,699
supporting lip and l1 for communication

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,010
with kernel which is an old version we

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,920
now have flippin out three what they

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:07,410
differ quite substantially so yeah it's

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,100
it's a lot of work it's a lot of a lot

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,899
of hex it's a lot of ugly code but we

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,130
need to have it you want to have it in

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:19,639
one place so we can cope with it and the

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,889
next thing is that we are actually

00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,769
putting the whole platform stuff in one

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,709
place which can be replaced with fake

00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,740
blood firm code and this will be used

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,540
for for regression testing so we will

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,880
have the whole network miniature

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,320
behavior tested yeah that's that's

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,720
something that's that's really new

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,810
because we only test the configuration

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,720
code and we do not test the actual

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:53,730
behavior so this this is currently

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:55,560
changing it may help anyone anyone who

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,930
would like to port network manager to

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,260
other platforms but this is not actually

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,670
our goal it's just a side effect of you

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:09,089
are doing and this everything I'm now

00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:13,079
talking about is about maybe clear code

00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:16,800
but definitely testing and preventing

00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:20,040
any regressions and preventing code that

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,709
just works for some developers and does

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,209
not work for users to go out to the to

00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:29,130
the actual issues this is just one thing

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:33,649
that we are working about there is

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:37,470
another a connection configuration is

00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:42,389
really user-oriented or desktop user

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:44,279
oriented which does not work for us we

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,019
will have to support some runtime

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,540
configuration that is not saved to disk

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,240
or you can save it to disk later or you

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,660
can make configuration make

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,140
configuration changes but then see that

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,000
they don't work

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,150
this is especially for visualization

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,170
purposes when the administrator is

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:06,810
connected from some fire host and he's

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,540
just changing the network configuration

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:13,300
it screws up and he's disconnected and

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:16,120
with proper proper tools with some

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:18,550
checkpointing and so on it's possible to

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,420
detect this and roll back to the state

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:27,160
that allowed him to connect back to his

00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:34,020
machine so this is this is also part of

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:37,440
our plans and we are also going to offer

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,790
API for all configuration changes

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,340
because we are currently providing like

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,250
five plugins for different configuration

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:50,530
formats we are going to continue with

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:54,190
that but we are trying to make other

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:59,100
projects like lebreton and similar to

00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:01,420
use the API so that it always succeeds

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:07,780
regardless what configuration format we

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:10,990
are using currently and we are going to

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:16,300
support IP configuration on devices that

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:18,550
are not supported by network manager but

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:22,390
don't be afraid this will not be all

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:26,200
automatic like like it used to be we

00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:29,500
will support things that that you want

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,760
to do explicitly and not just let

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,760
network manager take over everything

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:43,020
will be also supporting like runtime

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,400
connections that are not actually

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,710
configured by network manager that means

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,810
you have some network configuration from

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:54,790
some in Atari tools or something that

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:57,580
prepares it for you before the system

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,280
starts and network manager will just

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,320
take over to the correct utility so it

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,510
will take over the current configuration

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:10,020
and will not take it down as its it is

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,020
doing currently

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:24,070
so with the network manager and with

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:28,690
other tools we are going to fulfill some

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,030
some big picture of networking but

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,860
there's lots of other problems in Linux

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:37,630
at working we are trying to discuss and

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,810
trying to talk to people that could

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,390
solve them for us sometimes we are

00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,490
solving them ourselves because nobody

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:50,650
just does anything for us so it's it's

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:53,230
it's quite who have you works in the

00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:57,010
open source development community sure

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:59,410
knows what I'm talking about so we have

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:03,160
problems with DNS SEC because it works

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:06,490
but it does not work with VPNs it's it

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:10,570
has interoperability problems we are

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:12,490
trying to do ipv6 correctly with the

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,670
colonel but that's not possible we have

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:21,100
lots of workarounds to actually get the

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:24,790
proper information and what does not

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,030
really relates to network manager is the

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:32,050
current GF c code that can break

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:34,090
localhost if whoever wants to use your

00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,790
local host when you're disconnected it

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:42,430
might not work even with ipv4 even with

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:45,040
ipv6 so we are trying to discuss and

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,600
trying to fix also things in other

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,180
projects that are related to networking

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:58,060
and sometimes it's a problem multicast

00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:01,240
DNS elahi that's another chapter it

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,450
unfortunately have to rely on killip see

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,330
that means it can't even work with link

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,850
local addresses currently if you want to

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,160
have more information on this just poke

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:17,050
me I will send you the proper links and

00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,220
no problem so what we currently don't

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,560
support this is the dynamic

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,130
reconfiguration when you already have

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,650
your configuration of a type II

00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:27,530
six but it's changing at work this is

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:35,480
something we are just postponing so that

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:38,030
we can work on our stuff so just to just

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,730
to have a good picture of what we are

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,400
trying to achieve we are trying to

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,490
extend the target use cases of network

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,870
manager from desktop and laptop which we

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:54,260
like to keep working well with it too

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:57,230
just simple servers to more complicated

00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,760
virtualization hosts and we are

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,940
targeting also the interim FS images

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:08,720
which may be a surprise for some people

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:11,510
but we wanted to know from the inner

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,930
drama fest people and in fedora from the

00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:18,170
tech people what needs to be done to

00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,350
support this use case and whether we

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,570
need to make Network measure more

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:28,790
modular remove some stuff to make it

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,590
smaller remove some dependencies and we

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,840
realize that the other dependencies in

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,110
any time FS are much bigger than what

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,520
what we have with metal furniture so

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:41,180
currently we need we don't need to do

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,520
anything in the long term yeah it would

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,520
be nice to have some some improvement

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,490
simple routing use cases are mostly just

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,610
connection sharing but we are still

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:59,240
discussing some some extension of this

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,940
but we have especially problems with

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,800
ipv6 networking where we are trying to

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:09,250
avoid the ugly old network address

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,140
translation from many addresses to one

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:17,690
so that there's not a simple solution

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:19,820
and especially we want to prepare

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,970
network manager to work in a controlled

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:26,450
environment in which by which we mean

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:30,050
that network manager will not to do

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:32,300
anything automatically will not work for

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,360
the user but will work for some other

00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,990
demon let's specify exactly what we need

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,010
to do

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:47,150
so let's call it just a network API and

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:50,059
we are reaching the end of my talk we

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:55,480
asked the community to help us in ways

00:23:50,059 --> 00:24:01,490
they can and they want oh we actually

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:05,300
with network manager I I joined in my

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:09,620
horse in the beginning of May and I

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:13,820
think before I came we may be lost a

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:17,750
little bit because our bugzilla was full

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:21,980
of full of useless bug reports that were

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:25,160
not handled by our developers but now we

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,260
are changing this if you go to network

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,600
manager bugzilla if you look at the

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,480
general component which is all of this

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,250
stuff related to connections related to

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,050
configuration and you know everything

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:44,120
that is not wireless or VPN yourself

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:48,380
something it has something like 90 or

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:52,309
100 bug reports of which like 60 or 70 s

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:55,190
just feature requests and that means we

00:24:52,309 --> 00:25:00,290
are trying to to handle the bug reports

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:03,170
in some better manner we are happy to

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:09,020
hear about problems we are happy to hear

00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:14,270
about new possible features we kindly

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:17,750
receive by chase and we like anyone who

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:22,910
wants to work with us for some longer

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:28,640
time and in some some some matter that

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:31,070
will actually help the project so if you
