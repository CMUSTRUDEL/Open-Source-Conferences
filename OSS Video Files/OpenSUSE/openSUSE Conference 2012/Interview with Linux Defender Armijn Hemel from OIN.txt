header my name is your support fleet and

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,230
you're about to hear me interview our

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:17,740
man hey moe he has been defending the

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:21,279
new public license GPL violations dog

00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,350
since 2005 and now he is European

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,980
coordinator of the Linux defenders at

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:28,930
the open invention network and he will

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,300
be speaking at foreign one linux

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:34,449
conference in Prague and I asked him

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,430
about this linux defenders title our

00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:40,059
mind linux defenders that sounds really

00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,010
cool all is that about well it does

00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:44,080
really sound cool and what it is about

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,970
is you probably know that there have

00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,190
been quite a few pattern software patent

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,799
cases in the last few years loans

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,809
defenders is mostly about letting

00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,170
developers do what they do best which is

00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:58,570
make awesome software in kick-ass there

00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,030
quite a few companies out there who they

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:03,010
obviously are not a big fan of linux and

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:06,130
open source because it cuts directly

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,290
into their profit and what we do we try

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,780
to make sure that people can just do

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:15,310
what what they want without worrying too

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,140
much about being sued by a by patents by

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,430
a patent troll or a company you has

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,109
patterns and who doesn't like free

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,880
software so how does it work how do you

00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:28,430
do what you do I would say

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,610
it's not easy it's complex it's a lot of

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,070
politics but what we mostly do and what

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,020
I'm mostly focusing on is working with

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,659
developers and making sure that they

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,110
document their inventions yo Dakota

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:44,869
programs their ideas as explicit prior

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,509
art which we then put into a database

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,880
which is searching for by d x varies

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,700
patent offices around the world to make

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,409
sure that patents on their inventions

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,060
cannot be granted okay so I'm guessing

00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,549
this is what you'll talk about that

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,409
coffins I will talk about this and but

00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,149
also about more about open invention

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,989
network in general because we did we do

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:11,930
a lot more we work with we are working

00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:13,940
on long-term strategy to fix the patent

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,700
system because right now and the patent

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,340
system itself I think you could say that

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,099
it is stuff optimal when it comes to

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,680
software patents I wish I'm the fix that

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,209
and we have a short-term strategy

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,340
midterm and a long-term so i will talk

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,709
about that all talk about how people can

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,780
contribute with how they can work with

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,420
us what companies can do to make sure

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,579
that they can and that they keep the

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,880
freedom to innovate around their own

00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:44,450
inventions okay good these things are

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,019
really important but how did you get

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,090
involved next wing it's legal salmon I

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,609
wouldn't really find a very interesting

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,380
to be honest yeah so my man but my

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:56,120
background is actually I'm a I'm a

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,549
software engineer I studied computer

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,889
science and when I was at University one

00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:02,780
of the things I cared about is things

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:06,850
that I call software hygiene you know a

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:11,180
portability security all that and

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:13,370
licenses in MA and also patents are more

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,579
or less a logical extension there a

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:19,010
legal hygiene and the business IG and

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,590
Saturday that is the common theme and I

00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:26,019
thought I think that no

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,099
a software portability reducing bugs

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,930
making sure you got the license is

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,120
correct and also making sure that you

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,540
are and that you and you've got your pad

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,730
and stuff you know in order that

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,340
actually means you're lowering risk and

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,400
that is how I got involved because to be

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,510
honest I'm not a very good engineer and

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,610
there are many people out there who are

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,390
a lot better with that with coding and I

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,340
just want them to continue to make to

00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,459
make some awesome stuff I can then use

00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,280
that is my main motivation I just want

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:03,010
others to I to do what they're best at

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:06,709
which is being creative just kicking ass

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,840
yes that's what I'm a my motivation that

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,209
I was kick ass without bothering about

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,890
all this boring stuff so you take care

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,379
of them boring legal stuff so we know

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,430
Houston yeah so I'm shoveling a legal

00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:21,889
 yes that's true well that's greatly

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,510
