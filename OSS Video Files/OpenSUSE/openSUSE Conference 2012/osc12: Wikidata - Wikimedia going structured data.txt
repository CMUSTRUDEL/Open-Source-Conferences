alright so let me introduce Lydia

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,009
pincher from German Wikimedia to talk

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:19,199
about structure data and wiki data what

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:21,359
you become thank you um right so my

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:37,760
topic is a wicked data the next big

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:37,760
thing for Wikipedia um hello why is it

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,490
ah okay um so let's start with the

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,600
question how many of you have actually

00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:54,960
edited Wikipedia so far awesome that's

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,400
way more than I usually get it's

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,640
impressive okay oh so then you might

00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,949
know that this is the vision the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,750
Wikimedia movement aspires to imagine a

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,840
world in which every single human being

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,840
can fare in the sum of all knowledge and

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,740
we are trying to achieve this for

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,590
example through these projects you might

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:30,390
know some of them like we have a key or

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:35,250
well Wikipedia wikiversity decode and so

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:41,330
on um the most well-known one wikipedia

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,640
has over 23 million articles by now

00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:50,429
created through over 1.4 billion edits

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:56,009
and there's wikipedias in 285 languages

00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:57,360
by now that's quite huge and every time

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,700
I see these numbers it's quite

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,700
impressive for me but of course not

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,910
everything is great and Rosie in wickham

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,460
in your land um starting with the fact

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,000
that the software we keep here is

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:18,270
running on and its sister projects

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,090
mediawiki is actually if you look at it

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:27,150
pretty low-tech it's powerful but pretty

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,270
low-tech so for example if you take this

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,940
question which trucks are on the World

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,120
Health Organization's list of essential

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,470
medicine and approved for use during

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,790
pregnancy in the US wikipedia has all

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,780
the data for example the list of

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,129
essential medicines according to the

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,180
world health organization's and it has

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,900
pages on and it has the data about it is

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,010
approved for use during pregnancy

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,170
or not oh and we also have stuff like

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,950
the list of animal for the fraudulent

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:09,310
diploma or the list of inventors that

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,310
were killed by their own invention but

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,959
in the end this question is really hard

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,859
to answer because you have to go through

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,599
all of them and check is the son of this

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:25,359
or is it not on the list that's time

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:28,420
consuming um the second thing right now

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:31,269
editor retention and crew recording so

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:35,879
if you look at this picture it's a

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,879
screenshot of editing the

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:46,389
english-language wikipedia article on

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:50,799
Berlin um it's not really inviting so if

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:55,030
I have to go on the street and put a

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,549
random person in front of this they

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:01,720
would probably not be able to make any

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:04,419
useful at this article the other thing

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:09,160
is this is a smaller language wikipedia

00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:14,799
does anyone recognize the language no

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:17,760
it's hausa language in Africa um and the

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,729
four days before i took the screenshot

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,520
each edit on this wikipedia was done by

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,979
a bot so it was basically just pods

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,440
coming from the logic appears to this

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:33,520
wikipedia and setting for example links

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,610
between language versions that's really

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,860
if you're someone who speaks house' and

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:44,229
looks at recent changes on this

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:49,440
wikipedia the third thing is coverage

00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:52,479
and reach if you look at this um its

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,669
articles that are geotagged on the

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,909
english-language wikipedia so if tears

00:04:54,669 --> 00:05:00,580
for example an article on Paris there's

00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:02,740
a little dot on this picture and as you

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,150
can see english-language wikipedia

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,670
covers the word pretty well click be

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,200
better but you can pretty much see a map

00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:17,400
if you look at French now it's already

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:21,670
less you can't really see the whole

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:26,860
world land out anymore if you look at

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:30,340
the Italian yeah yeah not really a lot

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:42,490
outside of Italy right if you look at

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:44,760
greek and turkish well if if you look at

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:49,030
these numbers say I said have over 1

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,750
million articles for 40 week appears

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,730
have over 100,000 articles and we have a

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,830
total of 285 so there's a huge gap of

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,270
wikipedia's that are that exists and

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:07,300
have a article based but that are only

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:11,800
marginally useful to people who only

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:15,610
speak that language so we actually not

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:20,710
there yet we don't reach everyone was

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,900
the sum of all knowledge this is well

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,160
where we get a title project I'm working

00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,020
on comes in to help it will not fix all

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,380
of the problems that i mentioned but it

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,840
will help with some of them so what is

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:39,610
Vicky data it's a repository for

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,460
structured data repository for the

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:48,520
world's knowledge so you have to kind of

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:52,510
imagine it like of a Rolodex maybe but

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,160
you have cards about specific things and

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,440
then you have data like telephone number

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:03,610
and whatever on it it's a database that

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,390
anyone can read and edit it will be

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,800
multilingual because yeah we have 285

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,090
languages and we have to serve all of

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,040
them and it's designed to deal with the

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,410
reality wikipedia has to deal with what

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,750
I mean was that I've come to like him

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,390
and of course the whole thing is free

00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,560
software because if you run a free and

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:28,450
open

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,830
like we hear you better run it on free

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:36,040
and open software so this is an early

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:38,200
mock-up about how one page in Wicca date

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,010
I could look like about wicked editor in

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,540
this case oh there's for example the

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:48,730
organization that's doing it wikimedia

00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,160
dodge fund there's the IRC channel and

00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:54,880
it says that this particular one is on

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:59,160
freenode oh and by the way there's five

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,160
sources saying that it's an open project

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:06,040
the project is being done in three

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,930
phases the first one is actually only

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,880
really interesting for people inside

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:17,530
Wikipedia but it's basically blink about

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,720
linking languages or yeah if you have an

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,060
article in the German language wikipedia

00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,100
for example right now at the end of the

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,950
article you will have individual text

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,320
something saying oh and in the French

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,110
language wikipedia this is this article

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,479
in English languages but wikipedia it's

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,360
just article or and in Spanish by the

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,000
way it's this one and you have this in

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,669
each language and each article there's a

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,780
lot of duplication what you're doing in

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,800
this first phase is basically just

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,530
providing a means to put this in one

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,470
central place instead of having it

00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:57,310
duplicated in each article the second

00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:02,910
phases is about infoboxes so if you go

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:06,430
to an article in basically any wikipedia

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,709
you are very likely to find a little box

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:11,459
with the most important internet about

00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:13,930
the subject you're interested in and

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,880
basically what we want to do is to

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,660
provide the data in these and four boxes

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,830
in one central repository so each

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,440
language can have access to this data

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,080
because right now this sharing doesn't

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:36,480
happen so if for example the United

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:39,000
States what's um a new president soon

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,420
day someone will have to go and update

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,730
the article about the president of

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,930
United States in each language that has

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,850
such an article what we want to do is to

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,800
provide a means to chest to this once in

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:59,010
one place and the third phase is about

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,250
list so there's a lot of articles on

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,339
Wikipedia that are like list of United

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:09,630
States Presidents after the elections

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,209
someone will have to amend the list by

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,740
hand right now to actually reflect

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:19,769
effect or there's a new president um

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:24,630
what we want to do is to allow these

00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:28,880
lists to be created automatically I'd no

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:34,350
longer by hand and updated of course oh

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:38,130
and we're here right now so in the

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,750
second phase so but how well would you

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:44,970
be a regret I actually helped with the

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:48,660
problems I i mentioned before the first

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,930
one instead it will allow of a lot of

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,550
new micro contributions so people will

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,550
not have to write a finished article and

00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:02,930
get that on to Wikipedia but instead in

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:08,880
this case they can provide one data and

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:10,680
edit this particular data point instead

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,180
of yeah having to ride in a whole

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,190
article and can make a useful

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,880
contribution this way already and of

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:20,910
course the data has to move from each

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,260
language version of Wikipedia to the

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:29,970
central place siddhesh law that people

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:32,790
can can do um then we will support

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,180
smaller languages because they don't

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:39,870
have the manpower to to do a lot of the

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,899
research that is needed to be I keep up

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,279
with a huge article is so they will be

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:50,689
able to rely on the work being done and

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,689
sorry in larger wikipedias

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,810
suffering rehab is dead people well not

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,300
for this I have to put up with a

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,270
triptych wikitext but instead will be

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,940
able to use a form-based editor ready

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:16,980
contrast enter their stuff in a in a

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:19,890
nice form that will guide them um and of

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,810
course once you have to structure data

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,930
it is possible to automate a lot of

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,970
stuff that is currently be done by hand

00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:31,890
like amending lists articles after an

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:35,240
election um so this is all nice right

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:38,370
but why why is this actually special as

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,430
I said it will have to handle a lot of

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:46,589
languages um usually systems like that

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:49,560
don't the next thing is that it can

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:52,220
handle qualifiers and sources what baby

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:57,540
might add um if you look at Berlin here

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,550
um it says instead it has 8000

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,760
inhabitants of course it doesn't have

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:07,290
them right now but instead this was in

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:11,880
the 15th century so you can qualify your

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:15,980
data to make it more specific let's say

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:19,350
that for example here Angela Merkel the

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:25,130
Chancellor of Germany and she's the

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:27,660
transformations so 2005 and of course um

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:30,810
where viability is very important for

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,270
Wikipedia so you can enter sources

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:43,380
saying oh I have this data from this

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:45,770
place um there are some people laughing

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:52,459
in the audience they know the picture

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:57,120
okay um this to explain laughter is the

00:13:52,459 --> 00:14:02,930
donut home and there was a long

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,930
discussion about whether this assay and

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:12,930
I I thought it stopped but okay okay

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:19,020
this discussion is about whether this is

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:23,820
a few point or TV tower yes exactly and

00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:29,220
so wicked data will have to deal with

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:32,030
things like that um what does this mean

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:36,050
for for the world outside wikimedia

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:43,140
first of all we will provide a large

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:46,590
multilingual base of data that is under

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:50,460
an open license that people can use for

00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:54,500
free also outside wikimedia there will

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,330
be an API that people can access and

00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,140
yeah have access to a large ranch page

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:06,600
that it's edited by a large editor base

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:10,110
and kept great hopefully and of course

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,720
it's free software so you can also run

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:16,950
your own instance if you feel like it

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,860
and do other awesome stuff with it for

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:24,450
example people are already talking about

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,810
doing some of this with Ricky data for

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,990
example a watersports wiki so Ricky

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:37,710
about places that are great for diving

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:39,870
or canoeing and so on um then someone

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,700
talk to me about using it to track

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,770
patterns and how they influence each

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:48,720
other um or government institutions who

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,700
want to publish the data but don't

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,550
really know how and in which format and

00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:01,760
who hoped that this can be one place

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:04,500
that different institutions can actually

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,730
sorry different institutions can

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:12,000
actually agree on so they have a common

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,100
format and all of that and as a project

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,840
was interested in using it to track

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:22,630
ordnance data so

00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:27,100
data about mines and weapons and to use

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:28,990
this 24 disarm and basically um the

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,830
question that what you are going to do

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:35,880
with it um I hope a lot and I hope

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:45,400
you're going to help us make this vision

00:16:35,880 --> 00:17:07,480
reality thank you very much yes

00:16:45,400 --> 00:17:09,670
questions I just want to know what's the

00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,850
difference between what you're doing and

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,760
say semantic media wiki wiki wiki or

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,460
Kiwi wiki and a first one was semantic

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,520
mediawiki is it symantec mediawiki you

00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:27,450
you also using audio DF store I suppose

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:31,960
um so semantic mediawiki started out in

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:36,310
2005 was started by Danny funded church

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,100
and Marcos coach danny is currently is

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:43,330
actually very much involved as well so

00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,980
there are ties semantic mediawiki photos

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,370
who don't know it started out as a

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,760
project to bring over the goal to bring

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,300
semantics to Wikipedia which for various

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,410
reasons in yet did not work out but

00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:01,360
somatic mediawiki is used in a lot of

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:07,960
other places and quite successful um and

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:09,880
the relation is that yeah people for

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,560
example next week there's a sim

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,750
purchased a conference of this

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:19,240
multimedia with you guys um which we

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:22,270
will attend and in the end what we are

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,880
doing here is storing data in one

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:29,730
central place where a semantic mediawiki

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,730
did it inside the articles

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,590
yeah that's one difference the other

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,260
difference instead somatic mediawiki is

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:45,820
not from from starlight out to deal with

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:50,679
a lot of languages and it's not laid out

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,200
from start to deal with different data

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,260
for for the same thing so for example if

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,720
I the example with they do not form it's

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,059
not laid out to handle things like oh

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,929
there's disagreement about what this

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:12,399
actually is yeah I hope that answers

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:15,250
your question more questions I remember

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:18,399
seeing and data collecting open data

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,220
collecting side some years ago and I

00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:23,919
think it even had the possibility to

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:27,520
have different views on one thing like

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,440
it is a TV tower so it has this radio

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,320
stations ended as a viewpoint so it has

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:37,600
this properties and it could have both

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:48,520
at the same time okay I just forgot

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:50,110
tonight okay more questions no well then

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,610
thank you very much I will be around if

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,610
