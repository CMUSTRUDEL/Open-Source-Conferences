	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,660
afternoon to everyone my name is Gary go

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:14,730
I'm the guy who stands between yeah a

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,970
nice evening and yourself so well I've

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:22,010
got the honor to talk with you about

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:29,900
BYOD bring your own device in terms of

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,900
onboarding of Linux based devices so the

00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:42,270
BYOD is a phenomenon we are facing more

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,320
and more since almost i would say since

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,110
about one and a half year now since some

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,980
specific devices became more popular and

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,980
especially management people requested

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,510
their networking guys well this is a

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,640
nice device i don't want to use this

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,280
only for my private purposes i would

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,590
like also to use it for company purposes

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,920
so especially aruba networks as a

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:19,500
company which is focused on the wireless

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:24,470
Wi-Fi access as needs to have answer for

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:28,130
this because the new devices have no

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:32,130
Ethernet port and therefore Wi-Fi is the

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:36,540
premium or is the only opportunity to

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,390
get connected to a network just want to

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,170
go a little bit into Aruba Networks some

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,360
idea so that you know who is talking or

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,750
for which company I'm talking here rubra

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,820
networks the company is ten years old

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:56,159
now so we were founded ten years ago in

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,680
in 2002 and we are we started as a pure

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,310
Wi-Fi networking company so in times

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,420
when Wi-Fi was more an optional access

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,450
technology and especially universities

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,090
research environments adopted this

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,330
technology

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:21,330
in the early days in the meantime our

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:26,290
today especially because of the 802 11 n

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:28,900
standard the Wi-Fi became an alternative

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,489
access technology alternative to the

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:37,450
classical an axis and therefore today we

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:39,640
changed our our motto into people move

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,799
network must follow because the mobility

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,940
is what is in the in the Sun in the

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:50,290
center of what we are providing in terms

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:53,140
of solutions so therefore we designed or

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,680
week we invented an architecture which

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,959
is called Aruba move architecture which

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,200
is the mobile open virtual enterprise

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,140
architecture and which should ensure

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,470
that people are not limited to a land

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,319
port or to a Wi-Fi to get connected so

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,950
it should be independent for you where

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,470
you try to connect to to your corporate

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,260
resources and it should be also

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,380
independent of which kind of device you

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:29,760
are using so this is the aruba move

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:33,340
architecture aruba has round about 1,300

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,269
employees on a worldwide basis we have

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,959
round about 300 in Europe 10 of them are

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,630
in in Germany from which we are covering

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:48,310
also the central Eastern European Aryan

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:51,220
and yeah we're working together with

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,650
partners we have a very strong way of

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,200
linking with our partners and our

00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,650
strongest part in

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,620
in our territory is Error access error

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,290
excess is represented by a frank cypher

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,750
today and we have the honor to provide

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,879
the Wi-Fi here in this at this

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,040
conference and I hope that every one of

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,530
you is satisfied with the quality of the

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,660
exit ok so from the Prophet product

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,639
perspective we have our classical

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,240
products so the wireless LAN products

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,330
with a with a mobility controller so

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,820
which is the central brain of each Wi-Fi

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,919
network as a controller either it is a

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,810
dedicated controller or is the

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,910
functionality which is implemented in an

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:43,160
access point then we have land switches

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,970
which get provisioned in the same way

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:52,360
like access points I get provisioned and

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:56,030
we call them wired access points this is

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,320
especially because of we have customers

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:02,180
which have very specific security

00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,919
requirements they ask us isn't it

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,260
possible to have the same level of

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,860
security which we have in our Wi-Fi and

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,440
the same way to deploy it in an inner

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,229
inner switch so and then that was I

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,320
think it was I remember I think it

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:21,560
should be a should have been SI p which

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,510
asked us for that they are using a

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,139
rouble wife on a worldwide basis and day

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,760
and that was a starting point to go with

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,780
with lance which is then we have remote

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,380
office solutions that is for sure also

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:40,150
partially it is it has Wi-Fi technology

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:44,630
and then we have the VPN technology

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:47,510
using for that the same we have for as a

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,880
dedicated physics we have called wire

00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:54,590
client which is a VPN client which we

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:58,980
provide and last but not least we have

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,870
the the access management solution

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,040
called clear paths and this is exactly

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:10,680
what I would like to to talk with you

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:14,250
today so BYOD we headed on the first

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,880
slide bring your own device that is the

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,970
explanation like I found it in on the

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,570
kapadia so bring your own device is a

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,900
concept where people use services on a

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,660
device which is not owned by the service

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,950
provider or by the employer we can say

00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,400
as well let us bring your own device and

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:42,450
I was also googling for some some

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,810
further explanations of BYOD and I found

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,539
some very funny thing so for sure bring

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:52,590
your own device or perhaps bring your

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:54,840
own drink or something I am people often

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,090
uses bring your own disaster that is

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,330
especially coming from the network

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:04,770
admins when we talk with them about

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:09,110
abroad enabling the employees or guests

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:12,330
to bring their own devices so and

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:16,830
eventually you have some on your side

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:19,430
which i can add then and yeah do you

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:23,010
have some more but perhaps in the end

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,849
okay so what is the reason to think

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:29,479
about that it's really it's a massive

00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:32,210
it's a massive growth of mobile devices

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:36,060
so it's in general the the massive

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:40,760
explosion of the number of devices why

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:44,460
we need to be or we need to think more

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,970
flexible easier and getting devices

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:52,110
managed and connected something which is

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:56,990
which I found extremely impressive is

00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:04,740
the shift of of a windows dominated

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:05,310
world into some more balanced IT client

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,410
worlds

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:11,100
for sure we have the androids and the

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:15,390
iOS operating system me and we have we

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,430
have windows and we have linux so so the

00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:22,410
world is not just windows so the world

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:24,660
is much more cow of colorful and for us

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:28,230
it's important when we talk about

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,560
solutions to provide an open solution so

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,840
that is one of the main aspects we were

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,880
we need to cover so in when we think

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:41,460
about 2000 l11 it was really more I of

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,460
devices which should have should be

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:49,470
should get connected to a network so it

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:51,930
was more of the demand in 2012 it the

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,900
world looks different so we we're not

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,700
just talking about iOS we're not just

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,910
talking about about Android really

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,030
really talking about providing an open

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:10,920
approach of connecting guests and

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:15,030
employees clients devices the major

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:19,770
concerns is really to have a 22 address

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:23,330
on one hand the the high level of secure

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:26,330
trust environment with company-owned

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:29,970
fully managed and fully controlled

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,640
devices and on the other side to

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,150
tolerate that employers bring their

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,330
devices so that is exactly where we're

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:45,000
standing in between and it is and the

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:49,350
main point is operations so the we don't

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,050
want to to provide more load to the IT

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:57,630
guys so we will you our approaches to

00:09:52,050 --> 00:10:00,630
make it easier to to to have a high

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,540
level of self service in the

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,800
registration process so really to

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,620
simplify the provisioning of the devices

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,040
to maintain the visibility so to make

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,010
the device which get connected to the

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,350
network to make them really visible

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:25,610
and last but not least to keep the

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,290
highest security level which aruba

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,270
provided for 10 years already so these

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,850
are the i would say them free major

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:38,280
points which need to be addressed when

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:41,040
an organization goes into an BYOD

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,960
initiative so really to to make it a

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,620
plan to provide this service or not just

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,110
instantly to provide device or to

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,470
provide onboarding for employee-owned

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,940
the device just enough in just some

00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,220
certain situations who really make a

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:06,900
plan out of it the approaches to have an

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:12,740
open architecture so any device any user

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:17,220
and any location and forth really

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:23,970
policies across a heterogenous network

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:26,580
over Wi-Fi over wired up to to VPN

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:30,570
connection so to make it really easy for

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,760
for users to get connected independent

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,320
of which networking access technology

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:41,670
they are using oops there should be

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,070
device profiling so to enable so it's in

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:50,400
terms of visibility it's important to

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:57,090
know is this device employee-owned one

00:11:50,400 --> 00:12:00,390
is this ipad which we also deploy from a

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,730
corporate perspective a corporate one or

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:05,580
is a private one so the profiling really

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,290
to exactly know which kind of device is

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,900
used to get access to the corporate

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,690
resources multi-point that is should be

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,670
really independent of Wi-Fi technology

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:22,770
despite the fact that I ruwa started

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:26,220
with Wi-Fi it's okay thank you it

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,730
shouldn't matter secure and highly

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,639
scalable

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:36,709
that is it should Enterprise great

00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:39,319
solution the aruba clearpass access

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:44,600
management solution consists of four

00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:46,790
major components which is plus the clear

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,339
pass policy manager which is the central

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,429
the heart of the Clipper solution to

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:56,529
clear pass policy manager is the is a

00:12:52,429 --> 00:13:00,439
radio static x server enterprise-grade

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:03,470
radius server then we have the guest

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:06,920
access management we have the profiling

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,230
of the devices we have the onboarding so

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,029
the provisioning of the devices which

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,540
get connected should get connected and

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:18,220
we have the on guard for the posture

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,939
checks or for the health checks

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:27,139
everything works in a inner circle of

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:30,350
onboarding device yeah general pushing

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:39,620
the policies to the device and then

00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:43,249
enforcing the policies Quick Connect is

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:47,689
one of its is a service out of the cloud

00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:52,399
which combines all these aspects in one

00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:55,970
in one solution for organizations with

00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:00,860
which have which are starting to roll

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:03,230
out 80 to 1 X and implement 80 to 1 X

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:09,980
into their into the access management

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:12,529
for getting very fast rollout processes

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,499
for example in universities or in large

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,649
organizations which have highly in high

00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:23,720
numbers of devices which need to be

00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:26,569
rolled out and afterwards they they have

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:38,590
a normal that we say normal continuous

00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:42,520
business or or it yeah or sorry

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,590
and so so it's a it's a service out of

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,600
the cloud so company or jogging

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,930
organization doesn't want to take care

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:55,180
about a known infrastructure providing

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:58,350
the services so the level the way is we

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,440
have either a web portal where the the

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:06,790
the employee connects to or he has a

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:10,930
distributed media CD for example to to

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:17,860
get the Quick Connect enrollment service

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:21,310
and the the network admin has has access

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:25,270
to has access to the to the server and

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:28,660
has defined profiles for different for

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:32,410
different clients and in the process

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:39,730
then works in that way that the employee

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:43,210
gets connected it gets verified and gets

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:46,750
back the whole configuration so that all

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,970
the network setups eventually

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,940
applications will be pushed for

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,630
installation so that by the end of the

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,930
process the client is fully provisioned

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:01,350
for neck network access to corporate

00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,350
resources

00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:11,880
so simple as it is a self-service based

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:16,560
approach with which we have to really to

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:20,480
to make enrolling easy it's available

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:26,400
for Windows Linux Mac OS iOS and Android

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:29,190
platforms and it reduces the impact on

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:34,820
the IT people because they will they

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:41,130
just define all the profiles and then

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:44,580
it's a self provisioning service the

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,650
same we have on a in-house solution

00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,350
where we have the clear past policy

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:52,110
manager in the house and not host it

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,370
like it isn't in the in the Quick

00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:01,100
Connect service where the policies are

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:07,620
on the in the in the policy manager and

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:11,670
the the the user gets with his client to

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:14,579
the to the to the portal and get in the

00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:19,770
same way the settings and gets

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:22,560
provisioned and yeah and get the

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:26,040
application which needs to be to be

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,930
installed before he gets connected to

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,870
the network some specific client is the

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,960
guests that we have a very nice solution

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:42,720
which makes it easy again for the IT

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:45,750
staff it's a solution which can can

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,770
could be based on a sponsor sponsorship

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:54,120
that means when the guest comes to the

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:59,250
registration side besides he he selects

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:02,820
the person he is visiting and this

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,039
person gets a notification email which

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,019
needs to be

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:12,470
agreed on and then the the provisioning

00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:15,259
or their own the enrollment process gets

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,229
gets further and the guest gets a

00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:22,009
connection to the network so that is

00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:24,850
something which is especially in we see

00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:27,590
it very strongly in universities already

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:33,889
which makes it really easy to get

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:38,029
connected the on the on guard is a

00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:40,220
further module so the the clear path

00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:42,919
solution is based on the policy manager

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,859
and then you select which kind of module

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:51,609
and on guard is one of the modules which

00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:55,419
is responsible for checking whether yeah

00:18:51,609 --> 00:19:02,059
the personal firewall has the right

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:06,729
release and the antivirus petters are on

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:11,179
a current level so and and then

00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:14,570
depending on the result the the client

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:17,749
stays in a in a kind of current in VLAN

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:23,269
or gets connected to the network also

00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:26,179
this should cover all operating systems

00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:29,349
so we talk about Windows we talk about

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:33,470
linux and we talk about Mac OS operating

00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:35,869
systems in terms of iOS devices what we

00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,200
can do is we can use a specific service

00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:42,349
of iOS devices and do the network

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,749
settings on the device but we as you as

00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:47,509
you for sure you know we cannot push any

00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:50,479
application to the device but we can do

00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:52,609
the network settings in terms yeah

00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:57,229
compliant with the policies of the

00:19:52,609 --> 00:20:02,419
organization's running the network yeah

00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:06,739
and then policies need to be yeah rolled

00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:09,229
out and that is in a Wi-Fi network like

00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:11,479
we have it here it's done by the

00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:14,749
controller and as we have a multi-vendor

00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,330
solution this is done by the policy

00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:19,320
manager

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:22,380
and it can be granular to what kind of

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,350
device is the user using which operating

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:30,990
system at which location so it can be

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:33,270
very granular decide these are some some

00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,360
pictures which you are getting so that

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,280
you exactly know which kind of devices

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,700
get connected to the network so that you

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:48,030
have the visibility you need or you you

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:51,240
yeah you need to have and this is a the

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:54,210
level of accuracy we can reach so the

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,310
different aspects of of profiling and

00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:05,120
device and then for sure the policies

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:10,320
get well the policy get enforced and

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:13,130
this is fully standard come Senate based

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,320
and it doesn't matter with which kind of

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:24,000
Wi-Fi or Land infrastructure is behind

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:30,030
that so put together in a picture like

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:36,050
this process works so set up the

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:36,050
connection device and fingerprinting

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:47,340
get certificate and then we know who is

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:49,649
on the network and then we talk about

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,600
the applications talk about application

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:54,919
fingerprinting in terms of quality of

00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:00,840
service for specific applications and

00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:16,980
then this this scales and this okay this

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:21,269
is some for sure so we usually do that

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:26,789
on so the question was how we can ensure

00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:31,409
that that the one who gets access to

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:36,779
network and claims to be mr. X or mrs.

00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:41,999
epsilon so we can do it in many ways so

00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:45,059
we can we can do it by a password and ID

00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:49,679
we can do it whether we can do it

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:55,730
furthermore with with tokens we can so

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,730
we can can have multiple multiple

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:08,519
methods to two or we also combined to

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,879
get the security that you are the one

00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:17,570
you are claiming to be in terms of

00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:17,570
getting access to the network yes sir

00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:42,379
so what we are we are doing that this is

00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:47,489
question to be honest I cannot answer if

00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:50,909
it is required so what what a clear path

00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:54,330
is doing in terms of knack is that we

00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:59,429
are checking against against databases

00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:03,119
if the antivirus software on a device is

00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:07,589
current or or or not and needs to be

00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:14,749
updated and then to to put you in a in a

00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:18,539
certain current keen for example yeah

00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:21,419
but I'm here for for long I guess till

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:24,719
the end of the day so if you have any

00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:29,339
questions i guess i'm outside of this

00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:31,759
room and and can answer them ok thank

00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,759
