	00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:18,930
I talk yeah you stuff okay and do wrap

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,610
it off quickly like to give a tiny

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:26,039
little bit of background on why we had

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:28,770
this track at the conference so I don't

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,390
know how many here came for this track

00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,770
to the confident for any of the talks on

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:39,530
this track there are not many people

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:41,850
left but yeah there's no one left so no

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,470
reason we wanted to do this was to get a

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,570
little bit of a wider scope to the

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,090
conference right one hand maybe to get

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,250
people here who wouldn't come to a

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,540
conference just about technology and I

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,340
think that is in general a good thing

00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,010
trying and get people here who are

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,780
interested in in technology but not per

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,289
se in the hard core programming stuff

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,660
that a lot of us do and the other goal

00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:08,759
of it was to simply let the people who

00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,039
are or would come to this conference

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,920
anyway give them an opportunity to look

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,899
a little bit beyond the technology

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
specifically that we're working on so

00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:21,959
some of the talks here were about well

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,849
wiki data broadband free broadband

00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,910
networks I mean those are things that

00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:28,800
are not per se about open source

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,750
software but there are things that are

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,149
related to the spirit of what we are

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,119
doing right they they explore other

00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:39,899
areas where the freedom that is central

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,720
to what we do is relevant to and I think

00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:45,229
that in itself is worth while another

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,060
sides of that is also that you can see

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:51,090
benefits of the technology that we

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,920
develop in for example the open relief

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,750
project where our technology is actually

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,580
helping people I think it's really

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,660
important for us to realize that what we

00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,459
do actually matters to people outside of

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,979
our own group I mean a lot of people

00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,229
have free software say or do this to

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,420
scratch the round itch and that's really

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,250
cool but I think it's also important to

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,380
realize that what we do actually matters

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,870
I mean your grief said at some point

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,200
that we're as in the free shuttle

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,690
community are creating value

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,660
business for the European Union about

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,700
what was it 350 billion I mean that's

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,080
quite a bit of money that's quite

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,700
impressive you know for a bunch of

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,470
people just scratching around age I

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,720
think it's important for us to realize

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,360
that you know not only as motivation but

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,489
also to realize it's not just about the

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,090
cult it's also about people and about

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:45,630
society where we're making a difference

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:49,680
yeah I think when you was asked me and I

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,380
was teen to to host this this discussion

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,840
i was i was really happy to see that we

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,079
have such track because i think a lot of

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,720
the successful open source projects or

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,700
open development projects are for this

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,920
particular group they do it for

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,010
themselves and I think sessions like

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,500
this help to understand number one where

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,780
where other in other areas are these

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,430
things being used maybe what challenges

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,190
do these people have like as we heard

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,069
you know they like he had no expertise

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,349
on a narrow aerospace engineering right

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,660
but he had this great idea and in the

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,220
sense of common collaborating of sharing

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,799
knowledge I think it is important that

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,130
we as engineers so here I'm talking for

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,980
me and for my engineers watch left and

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,799
right and understand what our potential

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,950
users outside of our direct scope

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,709
actually use this for and what kind of

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,579
challenges they have I'm convinced that

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,680
if we have more of these sessions there

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,450
will be more people having this as a

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,989
thought not only as an afterthought when

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,170
I when I listen to social media articles

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,359
I'm very often smiling and saying you

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,000
know yeah this is social media Facebook

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,340
my girls now do this actually this is a

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
community much like our community here

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,120
but they are all users they are not

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,400
developers right somebody built it and

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,760
they are just using it so I think for us

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,829
it's important as developers to better

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,380
understand our user community and yes

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,169
it's being used in in really weird ways

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,450
we would never imagine and I think there

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,919
is more work for us to do not in the

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,229
sense that we have done a bad job but I

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,940
think there's way more open source that

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,390
can go in many more different

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,370
yes we just have to build these bridges

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,990
yeah there are a lot of people I you

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,780
know these days I believe the column

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,420
digital natives but I've also heard the

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,290
term being used digital zombies because

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,090
yes they know how to use Facebook but

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,510
knowing how to use Facebook let's be

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,160
honest not a particularly useful skill

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,660
being able to play a game and a computer

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,640
doesn't mean you can make again being

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,200
able to use Facebook doesn't mean you

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,730
really understand social media I

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,680
understand the impacts and the impact of

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,570
those things is really huge you know

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,060
gear across touching on you know what

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,430
you don't understand still controls you

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,920
and that's really an issue I think

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,750
becoming in our society most people you

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,190
know there are digital zombies that just

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,100
use this stuff and they don't really

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,290
realize that someone can walk around and

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,880
hack into their pacemaker well okay the

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,640
average digital native doesn't have a

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,820
pacemaker yet but 40 years from now they

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,180
might and this this is important and I

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,500
think a lot of us are actually directly

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,030
or indirectly working on these issues

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,710
but they might not always see the full

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,000
scope of it and it would be nice I mean

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,230
this was just the first time we did a

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,720
track like this at the opposite of

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,270
conference / linux ice now really hope

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,880
to be able to do more of this and maybe

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,790
we can manage to get more people outside

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,710
of a community to come here and not only

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,140
see what we are doing but also talk to

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,290
us about their needs and you know why it

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,970
matters what we do and I think that

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,130
would be really good thing in the future

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:07,950
so yeah I'm definitely gonna try and

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:12,030
keep this happening it definitely can be

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,640
beneficial both sides I mean if we the

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:18,120
amount of open source developers is kind

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,310
of a limited spaces there is so many

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
more users out there and the more

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,820
contributions and I'm saying

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,490
contributions by the users because not

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,830
everything has to be code we can get the

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,220
bigger our our community actually grows

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,380
and and vice versa the more they

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,690
actually sends the benefit of being able

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,970
to talk to a developer to change

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,440
something to their needs that's when

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,600
they realize that's the difference

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,880
between open sores and buying a product

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,129
of the shelf and just having a hotline

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,989
that's

00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,800
beautiful it's absolutely true i think

00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:53,869
people don't they just consume they

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,819
don't realize that's what i mean if this

00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:59,209
is some B's right you don't realize how

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,619
easy it can be to change things i mean i

00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:02,779
think a lot of us actually have had this

00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:05,300
experience of you know the first time

00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:07,069
you you submitted a bug report and

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,529
actually something changed I mean you'd

00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,539
that's really an interesting almost

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,369
exhilarating moment right you actually

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,989
made a difference here and the first

00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,149
pets you got in the first packets at

00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:20,869
what first you get flamed that's well

00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:24,469
yeah that also first might be a little

00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:26,059
less pleasant but yeah these these

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,649
things really make a difference I think

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:29,869
and the more people we can give this

00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,969
experience you know the more potential

00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:34,580
contributors we have or at least you

00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:36,949
know people you know using our software

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,139
is in itself already beneficial even if

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:41,539
they don't contribute per se they're at

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,689
least exercising their rights of freedom

00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,059
and that also in itself diminishes the

00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,999
power that of course certain well big

00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:55,309
companies have over technology and over

00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:57,349
software and general I think it was the

00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:00,379
idea of the wrap up to explain exactly

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:02,360
and encourage people to build more

00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:05,439
bridges yeah so the non-technical world

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,419
two things and thanks for coming and

00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,249
input is really appreciated I mean we

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,189
wanna do more of this and especially

00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:17,029
also from the speakers actually Ramona's

00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,740
here still Shane is here I would really

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,889
appreciate feedback also from you guys

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,629
on you know maybe how can we involve

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,999
your communities in this you know can we

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:28,669
get people from your communities to to

00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:30,559
to get closer to our community that we

00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,380
could really make a difference for both

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:38,649
I think we can help you you can maybe

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,649
