	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
okay hello everybody again here we have

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,970
buzz bondable that works at the media

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,380
research laboratory research is the

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,780
connection between technology and

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,310
society technology and society yes and

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,060
he will talk us about the owners

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,289
manifesto and an example of it of the

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,349
fairphone project okay let's welcome him

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:29,460
okay thanks for the introduction well

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,489
thanks everyone for being here

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,920
especially because I think for some

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,440
group it's already lunchtime I saw in

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,050
the program that it's kind of a mixed

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,399
thing like if you're in that area you

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,789
have lunch time now and if you're here

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,809
you can wait till I think someone passed

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,219
half past one so I think it's really

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,600
good for you being here even though it's

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,520
lunchtime so that's that's up front I'd

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,239
also like to thank opensuse for being

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,039
able to tell this this story so one of

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,750
the things I'd like to start with is

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:08,460
this and maybe some people here notice

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,700
feeling you know you have this feeling

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,520
where the whole world is pushing on you

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,990
and coming down in you but you you don't

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,170
know where to start you don't have an

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,280
idea how to and how to change that and

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,049
one of the things you can do is what

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,430
this guy did the occupied Wall Street

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,290
and make this sign obviously but I'm a

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,060
maker and I'll make stuff and I'd like

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,180
to believe that you can change systems

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,110
through starting with the product you

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,820
can change systems through starting to

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,250
open up stuff and that's what I'm going

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:49,320
to talk about today how you can change

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:53,159
systems through opening up stuff so why

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,979
is it important to open up stuff well

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,810
first of all if you open up something

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,840
you understand the systems behind it

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,909
it's a way to understand not only the

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,820
hardware the matter of stuff but also

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,590
what's around it and where it's coming

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,959
from it makes have transparent and if

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,940
you understand stuff it's much easier to

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,980
take action

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,980
because then you have a reason to do

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,390
something and you know that it's the you

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,470
know what the reason is behind that what

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,140
you what your action will be so like the

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,930
guy i started with i had my own shitty

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,610
moment a few months ago when my son came

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,490
to me and he had i have a nine-year-old

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,290
well he's ten-year-old right now but

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,650
he's at that time he was nine year old

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:44,060
and I think you guys can imagine a nine

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,250
year old when his Nintendo breaks and

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,320
the DEA's broke and you'll notice device

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,230
so it broke and he came to me crying of

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,489
course like that my Nintendo it's not

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,780
working anymore i saw the screen

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,970
flickering and i have a technical

00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,580
background side i know a bit of

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,940
technology i know how to use you know

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,760
screws on devices to be able to open

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,290
them so i thought well you know it's

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,840
probably a loose connector inside the

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,120
device and I'll open up the device and

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,720
I'll just fix it and my son is happy and

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,400
I can read my newspaper again but I took

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,500
the device i started screwing and

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,209
screwing and screen scoring and the

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,410
problem has set a certain point at a

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:31,620
certain point the the metal dust came up

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:33,870
and at that time I knew that I screwed

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,340
up the screws and if you screw up the

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:42,440
screws well you're screwed because if

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,170
you're if you have a screw which has and

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,700
that's the funny thing with Nintendo if

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,769
you have a screw which has a try wing

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,680
and you use a like the fore wing screw

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,299
on it it does no way to be able if you

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,549
if you mess it up to be able to open up

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,320
this device so what I did I got really

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,860
angry and of not as well of course I

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,230
smashed the thing like I smash like my

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,900
laptop is already i mean the latter was

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,110
ok but it's still you know and pieces

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,540
keeping together but when stuff doesn't

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,269
work for me this way i got really angry

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,780
and so I'm in tandem and in a way made

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:21,710
me throw away that the device and of

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,570
course i had a crying son and that was

00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,930
was you know the worst thing about all

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,810
situation

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,789
but in a way so you can see Nintendo

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,889
doesn't want you to be able to fix this

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,300
because it's you know they have it's

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:39,070
probably within their business model

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,240
it's within their liability you know

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,650
there's all kinds of reasons probably

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,259
why they don't want you to fix it but

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,820
you know I found out that they really do

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,830
not want you to fix it and now you can

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,539
buy this the screwdriver online i just

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,039
bought i think at five of these

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,560
screwdrivers because i wanted to make

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,949
sure that i had one if i needed one so

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,740
there's always someone who makes this

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:03,430
these things match but anyway i think

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,979
you get the point it's not only nintendo

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,099
and proprietary systems that are the

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,599
problem for being you know for for not

00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:14,009
being able to open up our devices

00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:18,180
there's also this thing i'd like to call

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:22,539
electronic anorexia we like thin and

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,599
that also goes for our devices if you

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:28,810
look at if if you look at the laptops

00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:31,900
electronic so thin they get it's great

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,150
and we love it but there's also downside

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,610
to it so let's take a look inside the

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:42,190
laptop so if you open it if you really

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,530
if you are able to open it then you get

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,110
into this product here and what you see

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,300
here is that the battery of the macbook

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,080
the newest macbook is threatening retina

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,900
macbook from Mac it's glued to the

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,780
casing and it's glued to the casing not

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,340
you know for because they like it like

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,780
the glue to the to the casing but it's

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,940
glued to the casing because they want to

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,130
have it thin it's the set factor that

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,530
counts with in consumer electronics the

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,349
same goes for phones so embedded

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,070
batteries are a result of a design

00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:17,620
decision which is aimed at consumers and

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,120
because we consumers like a thin Apple

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,770
things well let's make it thinner and

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,419
lets you know glue the batteries to it

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:31,919
because that's the only way we can make

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:31,919
it thinner and that has consequences so

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,390
if you look at this this is one of the

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,120
consequences from making a stuffed

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,510
thinner what Apple did is they pulled

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,250
back a while ago from the AP 80 and the

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:53,040
apt is a green electronics label they

00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:58,350
basically set up the apt at that a few

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:02,760
years ago and what they said is well our

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,920
standards do not really fit the design

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,320
the desired the standards of the apt

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,380
don't really fit the design direction we

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,210
have with Apple right now so and I'm a

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,400
designer have my background is also

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,980
designed so for me that's really weird

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,510
it's like saying well you know I'm going

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,130
to design something and normally you

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,570
have the requirements and you know you

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,370
have to design something recording too

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,800
little bit you know regarding the

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,690
requirements and what apple says is well

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,940
we make something and afterwards we look

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,400
at if it fits the requirements and if it

00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,600
doesn't fit the requirements then we say

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,330
the requirements suck so that's kind of

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,550
turning the world upside down and that's

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,020
a mistake i think and luckily apple

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,690
thought the same because they had a lot

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,510
of angry people the day after day they

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:52,350
pulled out of the apt and they went back

00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,900
in again and this is one of the rare

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,190
mistakes you will see from from Apple in

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,080
that respect and you know I might sound

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,330
a bit like I'm bashing apple and I'm

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,880
also standing here with you know I think

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,410
everyone in the future media Trek kind

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,510
of agreed on bringing their apples

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,810
because till now I've only seen apples

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,820
but it's not about Apple but at the

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,350
point i'd like to make because I I can't

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,290
of like the device because I've tested

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:23,550
it around many times and it still lives

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:27,330
so it's kind of sustainable but there's

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,950
designs decisions related to you know if

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,340
you if you look at the design decisions

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,810
people make for consumers or any kind of

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,640
reasons the business models around it

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,560
and how it impacts for example the

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,690
environment how it impacts also the

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,670
ownership for people because if you

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,230
cannot own your product how can you you

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,840
know how can you be able to own them how

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,980
can you feel ownership of this for

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,920
of that of these products so I think

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,140
that's one of the key elements this is a

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,150
quote from makes in if you can't open it

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,670
you don't own it I don't know if you

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:05,330
people people you know mixing and make

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,130
you know it's a it's an online it's both

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,920
offline and online environment for

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,160
people to you know who enjoy making

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,380
things and it's much more than a

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,180
magazine only it's it's it's it's a

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,600
community of people getting together and

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,350
make stuff and what I really like about

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,360
this community is that they see

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,510
ownership not as property but much more

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,790
as in as an engagement no it's not that

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,470
i own this product you know they say if

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,180
you can't open it you don't own it not

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,970
owning in the ways of you know it's mine

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,430
but owning in a way of okay i can engage

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,580
in the product so i feel this ownership

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,350
and these are the kind of people like

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,440
myself i want to be able to repair their

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:53,750
own mac order nintendo so they came up

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,560
with a manifesto the makers Bill of

00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:01,370
Rights and for the fun of it i'm i'm

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:05,200
putting the the apple macbook next to

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,200
the manifesto and see how they fit so

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,420
cases shall be easy to open well i've

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,190
showed you that that's kind of hard

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,900
because it's all glued and there's no

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,720
you have to send back your apple also to

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,180
or your iPhone or whatever to be able to

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,690
open it these of repair shall we design

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,010
a deal not enough afterthought well no

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,750
battery should be replaceable well they

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,410
glue to the casings or they aren't not

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,610
replaceable for people themselves

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,870
special tools are allowed only four darn

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,180
good reasons well the try wing

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,080
illustrates that it's not the case for

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,420
many of our electronic devices and screw

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:46,090
is better than glue as well at that one

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:49,520
as well so you can see that the

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:54,380
manifesto kind of holds and attitudes

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:57,230
which we also see in the internet in an

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,270
Internet community it's it's about

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,960
exchange of information it's about open

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,690
products it's about being able

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,150
to access information about what what

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,830
you're doing and being able to access

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,010
information about the products your own

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,570
or the systems your own and in that way

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,150
I think also looking at the maker

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,290
community it's really interesting to see

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:23,450
because what they do is they apply

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:26,460
open-source principles the real stuff

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:29,340
but if you apply open-source principles

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,730
also software principles to real stuff

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:37,080
it also raises the question like what is

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,610
open source of real stuff and it's not

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,230
only you know it's not it's definitely

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,670
not only the design of being I've been

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,320
showing you like how you design stuff

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,060
it's not only the cat files you can

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,760
share online and people can download it

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,960
I think it goes much further and to

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,150
answer this question let's have a look

00:11:48,960 --> 00:12:00,060
at some of the stuff is made so anyone

00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:04,050
has any idea what this is I knew there

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,760
was someone here would notice so yeah

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,250
it's a capacitor it's a lecture later

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,250
capacitor and and do you know because

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,740
you obviously are familiar with the with

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:23,730
the thing you also know what what is

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:25,230
made of like the minerals inside know so

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,660
there are minerals inside and one of the

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,810
main components for an electrolytic

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,530
capacitor is scholten a Colton is a

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,590
mineral which is mined in Congo eastern

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,420
Congo for a big part you know it comes

00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,690
from others other areas in the world but

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,570
eastern Congo is an area where Colton is

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:50,000
being mine as well and well let's have a

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,000
look how that works in conroe

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:12,009
this chance he's 16 he says that for the

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,130
last three years has been working in DC

00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:17,940
the biggest illegal mine in Congo he

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,940
wants to take me there

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,430
see this is a holy book were there

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,320
they're living with really horrible four

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,590
years ago this place was nothing but

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,030
jungle today 15 to 25 thousand people

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,710
are working autumn about it different

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:50,400
armed groups are fighting to gain

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:54,390
control over the mind these teenage boys

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,310
stay down here for several days taking

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:59,910
out minerals essential for the mobile

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,940
industry minds like these are feeling

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,970
the world in the last 15 years more than

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:09,180
four million people have died these

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:12,390
minerals end up in mobile phones like my

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,580
nokia does that make me responsible we

00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,400
are all responsible and you know that

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,250
all this is going into you we must be

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,490
revoked by this situation where you

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,490
might be

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,519
well that's that's really eyes of a

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,360
documentary maker of course you know

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,600
it's it's dramatic dramatic Lee but it's

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,939
true on the other side so I wanted to

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,459
show you that you know to give you some

00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:54,009
of the context and you know what what if

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:56,860
after this stuff comes from the mines

00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:59,350
and it's been melted into Colton it goes

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,029
to these kind of factories and you you

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,139
might know some of the stories around

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:07,149
Foxconn and the production of Mac

00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:10,779
products but also send some nokia all

00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:14,050
these big companies there at these these

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:15,879
kind of factories in China and even

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:19,120
though they are in the news of doing

00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,499
really really bad they're compared to

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,230
your other factories in China they're

00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:26,379
doing really splendid job so you can you

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,749
can imagine how bad it is if you go

00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:31,329
second third fourth fifth tier into the

00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:34,389
production chain the suppliers of the

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:36,040
supply is it also becomes exponentially

00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,230
more complicated to trace all these

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,899
minerals and to to look at how the

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,990
production line is in place but anyway

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:45,309
so we get this stuff into our products

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,079
and then we get the products and we're

00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:49,540
not allowed to open them because they

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:52,600
you know we want them thin and they put

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:57,399
them together and well you got these

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:00,790
these embedded batteries again and if we

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:05,529
are ready with consuming our products

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:08,559
and I think we as Westerners produce

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:10,779
about 15 kilograms of e-waste I've every

00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,519
year and all this stuff ends up

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,139
somewhere around the world and most of

00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,500
the stuff ends up somewhere in Africa or

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:19,629
India or you know as a waste with all

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,910
the chemicals and meta batteries and all

00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,589
this stuff connected to it so who is

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:28,629
responsible who's you know where's the

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:31,179
ownership of this stuff and where is the

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:36,100
transparency and where's the the shared

00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:40,179
value in all these products so if you

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:46,950
want to change this you know you can put

00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:49,980
up a sign like this but like I said I'm

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,920
like to make things and i'm also i

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,200
really believe that we can start with

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,530
the stuff around us to be able to change

00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,870
these systems so i'll illustrate that

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,900
with a project we did that boxer cited

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,730
the media lab by i work with and we're

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,560
still working on a product project and

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,959
it's it's really cool because it's

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,000
really becoming a product now with a new

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,670
company around it and the project is

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,579
called fairphone and which fairphone is

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:21,589
based it's really simple because what we

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:24,839
said we're going to make our own phone

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:27,449
and that's the easy part and why do we

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:31,140
want to make our own phone well you you

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:34,500
saw why because this phone will be based

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,480
on human values and the goal is to

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,580
really put this phone into the market to

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,220
offer alternative but it's also a means

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,840
to an end by making the phone you have

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,600
to tell the story you have to go through

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,500
all the systems that a normal phone

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,610
producer would go to through as well and

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,260
in that way it becomes kind of a

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,150
storytelling artifact we want to create

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,850
a phone which tells a story which shows

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,010
what's wrong and which shows also how

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,930
you can do it better and it also creates

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,320
a platform where other people can join

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,790
and also helped create this this better

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,430
situation around the whole supply chain

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,660
and create this shared value of all the

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:15,350
people involved so in a way it's like

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,000
you know creating world peace but

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,810
there's no fun and creative oh please

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,820
and its really now youths fun to create

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,800
a phone and I think a lot of people are

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,840
already helping us in that so in that

00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,960
way what we've done what we've done is

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,930
to make it really tangible and small by

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,420
taking the phone as you know the message

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:40,230
but also the means to an end and the

00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:45,270
goal itself so how do we do that we

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:47,570
started with in Congo also Africa earth

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,570
mining

00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:02,210
lonely plan the dignity simpatico sadly

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:06,410
so nice to our model i miss something

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:12,500
sashimi plotted versus you buddha don't

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:16,640
bow by my harness something can you say

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,070
something fairphone is the world's first

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,740
collective nonprofit technology company

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,280
developing a phone using minerals mined

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,440
insoles under equity conditions recently

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,900
fairphone undertook affect finding

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,640
mission to katanga the most southern

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,150
province of the Democratic Republic of

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,280
Congo katanga soil is full of copper and

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,770
cobalt the letter being used in

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,049
batteries for mobile phones the

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,510
fairphone crew visited various parties

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:48,130
in the mining industry from high-ranking

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:50,960
officials to artisanal miners the AV guy

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,179
this short film shows you some

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,910
highlights of a very successful dope

00:19:53,179 --> 00:20:01,640
bumpy expedition towards the heartland

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:04,400
of Congo's copper belt ok so but it's

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,190
not only the the mining we're talking

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,540
about of course because it's the whole

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,330
production chain you also have to think

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,520
about about the design of a phone and I

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,010
just I just found out yesterday actually

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,260
that dice was involved in making this

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,870
design one year ago one and a half years

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,350
ago something like that so what we did

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,350
we we also place calls online through

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,380
websites for people to help us come up

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,510
with with ideas on creating a fair phone

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,640
of course you cannot put all these

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:37,010
designs in the phone already we're not

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,440
going to produce you know a design which

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:42,650
is which is more likely futuristic

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,929
thinking but it helps us also to find

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,880
also you know what is important to

00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,730
people and where they want to you know

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,370
where they want to go to so involve

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,190
people in the design look at new

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,900
technologies like 3d printing and open

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,809
source you know we're talking with

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,380
Firefox OS to implement it into the

00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:03,020
first phone

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,730
Mozilla to find out if we can get you

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,890
know more radical transparency into the

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,940
phone as well but still keep it as a

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,590
good consumer product and we also have

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,750
to look at how we design in such way

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,000
that we encourage this new engagement

00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,450
you know this new ownership instead of

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
putting it as a closed system but also

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:26,600
what is the lifespan of a phone alchemy

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,790
encourage encourage longer people to use

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,300
their phones longer because 18 months

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,100
it's really nothing and I'll show you

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,420
you know the question is do we really

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,780
need a new phone and I'll show you a

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,220
short short film and then all this kind

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,020
of funny how people react when the new

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,360
iPhone comes up some people actually get

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,610
mad why would they make another product

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,950
I desperately want to buy those bastards

00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,290
it's almost as if the new iphone somehow

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,940
ruins the old iphone but it doesn't it's

00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,890
it's all in your head in fact we set a

00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,300
camera out on the street today we told

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:00,110
people outside to check out the new

00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,400
iphone 5 which is unavailable so far so

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,100
in reality they were what they were

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,770
looking at is the current iphone 4s that

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,970
everyone has and well here's how that

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,970
experiment played out

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,790
the new iphone 5 just came out today we

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,080
want to know if you'll take a look at it

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:20,870
tell us how it compares to the last

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,720
iphone I'd love to oh it's way better

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,490
yeah it's nice

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,260
let's definitely noticeably better it's

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,000
a little a little thinner looks like the

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,130
screens a little bigger seemed a little

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,400
bit faster yeah well you get the point

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,929
so I think one of the one of the

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,620
important things here is also that we

00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,590
had we need to know that you know as a

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,789
consumer is consuming as a political act

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,590
but to be able to make it a political

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:50,360
act you also need to know the stories

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,190
behind the product and that's what we

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,919
try to do with this phone to tell that

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,570
story to also get consumers involved in

00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,539
that and to show them that they actually

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,220
their decision is also one of the things

00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:06,860
that determines how the supply chain

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:08,419
will be able to change so it is not only

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,799
about the story you also need a great

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:11,690
product and that's one of the hard

00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,760
challenges you know I come from a more

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,010
idealistic background but then you know

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,650
at a certain point that now we're really

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,630
going to make a phone and people have to

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:24,470
buy that phone to be able to keep this

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,450
thing sustainable so in our first phone

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,330
we do you know we take the first steps

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,409
because we cannot make it a fair one

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,760
hundred percent fair I don't really

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,860
believe hundred percent because it's not

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,350
an absolute thing but we take it

00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,940
step-by-step conflict-free thin we

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,760
already put that in the first phone we

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,530
have a self assessment system in place

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,559
where people in the factories can self

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,850
assess their working conditions and

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,760
we're getting back electronic eway

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:55,190
through a system with a NGO who's taking

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:59,270
back to us from Ghana and then you

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,919
needed price will be around 220 pounds

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,419
so it will be you know the price will be

00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,370
okay compared to all the other

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,980
smartphones and then the phone has to be

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,590
beautiful of course so that's why we at

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,360
now we're really designing this phone we

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,700
have some of the investments ready and

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,740
it's kind of weird because we started as

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,710
a campaign but now we're really you know

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:22,460
going into production so buddy I think

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:24,080
next year june we will produce around

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,789
ten thousands of these phones so if

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,039
people you know if people interested go

00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:34,370
to the website you can already

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:35,899
pre-register just to wrap up let's take

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,740
a step back and it shows you fair phone

00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:38,660
and

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,630
and I think fairphone is about creating

00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,370
creating meaningful relations and it's

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,290
about consumers it's about the makers

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,410
involved in the end this whole system

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,510
and i think that's that's also like what

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,059
we do with open source you create a

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,940
shared value around all the people

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:58,100
involved it's not you know the consumer

00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,780
and you have the maker no it's it's like

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:04,309
this whole community of people working

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:07,040
on one product and and to me it's also a

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:09,620
way to reverse what what you know what

00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,470
Marx already predicted that you got this

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,500
alienating effect when you make stuff

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,240
more and more complicated and of course

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,160
things have become so complicated that

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,590
we cannot grasp it anymore but if we

00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,360
create communities around it we can at

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,880
least feel part of that complicated

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,360
complicated system and feel attached to

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,970
all these dots and the whole system so

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,400
why is it important to open up stuff

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,770
well because you can understand the

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,630
systems behind it and if you understand

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,980
the systems behind it you can engage and

00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,420
take action I think that's really

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,610
important to be able to solve all these

00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:47,170
big issues we're dealing it at the

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,170
moment so thank you

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,179
less time for questions we don't have

00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:01,710
time for questions but okay you will

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,960
still be here for the round table so

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:11,730
after that if anybody wants to ask

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:14,610
something after that all right okay do I

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,820
need to keep this on then put a round

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,820
table

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,610
