alright thank you very much shoulders

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,020
not too many people but at least that

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,890
means that the people who are here are

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,800
interested I hope so just a quick show

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:27,390
of hands who here dislikes software

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,609
patents so that's a one hundred percent

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,189
score so who is completely loathes

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,500
software patents and hates them with a

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,579
passion I guess that's also almost one

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,380
hundred percent so a little bit of

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,700
background information I'm actually an

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,510
engineer I'm not a lawyer I'm not a

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,820
patent guy I started out with with doing

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,460
all kinds of stuff that revolve around

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,160
reducing risk I did stuff with build

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,770
forms to fix portability bugs I dabbled

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,570
in security as since about seven years

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,010
have been doing a lot with copyright

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,480
enforcing copyright licenses and to me

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,270
dealing with patents is not a forum to

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,460
reduce risk namely business risk because

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,920
there is a lot of there's a lot of

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,470
patent aggression and patent issues

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,909
there are in the world right now and I

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,340
think those should be addressed because

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,610
otherwise they could vastly hurt or a

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,479
community and our freedom to operate so

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,369
I work for open invention network I

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,890
first slide about open invention for

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,650
what we actually do open invention

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,750
network is committed to ensuring freedom

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,600
to operate around linux and open source

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,530
we do this by various things for example

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,810
we are and we are trying to create a no

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,170
patent no-fly zone around linux and open

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,070
source and making sure that Linux is a

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,649
safe platform for innovation and

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,070
deployment we did it well we do a few

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,159
things we're involved in long term

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:59,070
patent reform which is very interesting

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,200
and challenging but its long-term mostly

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,750
what we do is we do things that try to

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,590
fix current issues we do things with

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,590
defensive publications we have a patent

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,790
pool that we that we try to create wear

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,410
it with companies pledging

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,000
non-aggression I will talk about that a

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,659
little bit late

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,989
but our core goals are limiting the

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:26,760
threat of patent aggression and also if

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,500
possible removing the threat so just to

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,780
make sure we're on the same line I just

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,170
want to know when to give a little bit

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,049
of a definition about what a patent is a

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:41,489
patent is a time-limited monopoly in

00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:44,340
exchange for full disclosure so if you

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,230
have a patent description then from that

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,810
description you should be able to

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,360
re-enter to remake the invention that

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,489
the inventor has described so that's why

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,230
when you when you see a medic mechanical

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,299
invention you see all these charts and

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,549
diagrams and all that and that someone

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,640
who is knowledgeable in the field should

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,670
be able to recreate the invention based

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,250
on the on the information in the patent

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,060
and it's an agreement that that people

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:14,160
say you know you have a valuable idea

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,230
you're willing to open it up completely

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
so in exchange we will give you a

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,660
monopoly for a limited number of years I

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,989
think it's 20 years event there there's

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,260
a variety of of years that can be

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,540
granted and so that's actually what a

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,900
patent is in exchange for full

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:39,000
disclosure you can be you you're allowed

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,370
to become filthy rich of that patent so

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,859
the amount of patents are increasing so

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,299
this is this is just the US patents was

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,450
made by by one of my colleagues in the

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,940
US so it's only only focuses on the US

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,459
but right now so the overall pattern

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,190
grants so not applications but grants

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,900
patterns that are actually assigned it's

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,590
right now it's about so last year was

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,470
around 240,000 good this includes I

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,660
design patterns mechanical eye medicine

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,489
you name it this is not just software

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,000
patents all patents in the US that have

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,889
been granted and also the amount of

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,070
software patents so the first bar

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,750
actually says 1991 but that means

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,209
pre-1990 one so all of the software

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,580
patents granted pre-1990 one is the

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,310
first bar and then you can see the

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,730
increase of what has been granted in up

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,440
until last year

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,410
you can see that it's it's steadily

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,380
growing even even if growing very very

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:40,210
fast in the last two years and with that

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,190
again this is just the US and with that

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,910
the amount of software patent lawsuits

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:48,190
is increasing as well again the US but

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:54,460
it's it actually has gone off the chart

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,930
literally so that you know debts comes

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,730
with the territory there's more no more

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,740
patterns or more software patents or

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:04,690
results they're also more patent

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:08,980
lawsuits and this is a problem at least

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,600
for for some companies so before I

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,220
continue some remarks about the patent

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,310
system and many people say you know the

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,900
patent system is I don't know if

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,280
that breaks breaks during the code of

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,310
conduct but I'm going just going to say

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,960
many people think it's screwed and it's

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,220
true there are many software patents if

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,720
you just look at software patents there

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,130
are many software patents that are of

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,110
bad quality they suck big time but we

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,820
have to face it the patent system is not

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,360
going away anytime soon because the

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,530
patent system is much much bigger than

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,240
dangerous software patents if you looked

00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,280
at the charge carefully you would see

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,170
that the amount of software patents

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,580
being granted is about twenty-five

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,160
percent of all the patterns that are

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,370
granted so if you are going for patent

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,410
system reform that means that even

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,350
though software patents is becoming a

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,240
big chunk it's still only a part the

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,090
vast majority still some other patterns

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,390
so if you're going for the for a patent

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,820
system reform you will have to battle

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,340
companies that have vast vast amounts of

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,500
money and many many lawyers it's not

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,480
easy so that means that right now not

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,760
playing the patent game especially in

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,880
the US is not an option for many

00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,820
companies and even even outside the US

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,170
it's becoming less and less of an option

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,940
so I know of companies who are you

00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,680
eternal even on the US market and

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,690
they're being sued by patent trolls from

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,490
the US and you violate our patent

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,640
they're not even doing business in the

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:40,720
US so this is becoming a much more of a

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,560
global threat as I said panel system

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,000
reform

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,669
we'll take a long time and even if we

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,950
can get a patent system reform we don't

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,840
know if it will be what we want with

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,790
what we want it to be it could take

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,090
decades and we could be worse off than

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,800
we are off right now so we are trying

00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,400
with open invention at work we're trying

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,380
to work within the system and fix we're

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,380
much more focused on fixing current

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:10,120
issues so the software patents as I said

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,340
they're often off a bad quality so what

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,919
does it mean first of all I want to

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,620
stress I am NOT saying that there are

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,900
good software patents open invention

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,639
network is patent diagnostic basically

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,380
we don't care if there are patents or

00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,780
not the only thing we care about is

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,160
freedom to operate but we do know that

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,740
there are software patents that are of

00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,830
bad quality bad quality meaning they're

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,560
trivial they're not novel there exists

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,930
prior art so the invention has been done

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,440
before or even the same method has

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,790
already been patented by someone else or

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,320
the claims are just you know to vague

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:48,910
too broad and they seem to cover

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,800
everything and that makes it makes it a

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,510
big threat also pet software patents are

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,430
not limited to the u.s. many people

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:57,010
think you know hearing your safe will

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,250
forget it software patents are a reality

00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,440
in Europe then they always say no but

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,190
what about pure software patents it is

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,419
true that pure software patents bear not

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,460
being a force but they are being

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:13,660
assigned they are being granted and

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,940
within a few years with all these

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,860
bilateral agreements i can tell you that

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,630
there will be a point that software

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,270
patents pure software patents will be

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,580
enforced in Europe I mean there was this

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,460
what we're all these acts will act on

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:30,490
this its successor it's gonna it's going

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,440
to be a mess also due to all kinds of

00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,380
bilateral agreements with comp with

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,400
between countries US patents are valid

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:42,909
in Japan in Taiwan and Australia and

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,110
also say you are a company and you say

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,410
you know I don't like don't like

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,900
software patents bank of america has a

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,089
huge amount of cash and says you know we

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,380
want to have your solution implemented

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,450
in the US are you going to turn them

00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,640
away

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,230
if they say you know we were going to

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,420
pay you I don't know 10 million u.s.

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,860
dollars 20 million 30 million are you

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,260
going to say you know you know I don't

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,000
really like the US patent system so I

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,090
don't want to take your dirty dirty

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,330
money no of course not you're gonna say

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,750
yeah come bring it at least that that's

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,280
what I would do so far I know of I think

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,570
about two companies who've said

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,740
something like that now we don't want to

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,610
do anything in the US market though if

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,890
you're a company if you're a business

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,840
guy then you would definitely you would

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,350
not turn down an American company that

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,940
just did it just has a has vast amounts

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,090
of cash and then you will have to care

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,690
about patterns it's a sad truth I wish

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:43,800
it wasn't like that but it's like that

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:45,600
so if it would want to limit or you know

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,950
or remove the pattern threat there are

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,170
three points in time where we can

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,500
interfere the first the point is before

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,060
a patent claim is even submitted so that

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,710
means when when it's submitted the

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,110
patent examiner looks and says you know

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,020
there's prior art but for that we need

00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,550
to have documented prior art and it can

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,990
be down to the fat as a defense of

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,320
publication and I will talk about that

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,050
later on more also during patent plain

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,300
examination there right now their

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,090
systems in place in Europe and also

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,190
since September 16 in the US where

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,190
people can submit prior art after

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,140
reading a patent application so you know

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,450
for this patent application there exists

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,190
priority you can find it here and you

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,990
can submit it to the Patent Office and

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,660
they might or might not take it into

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,670
consideration to either bust the pad and

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,970
bust the patent claim or narrow down its

00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,920
claims all you could do it as a post

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,470
issue so the pattern has been granted

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,310
and you're trying to bust it the earlier

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,080
we the earlier in time we can do it the

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,060
more effective it is and definitely the

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,800
more cheaper it is it's it's like you

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,230
know software engineering the waterfall

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,320
model downstream it's very expensive to

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,280
fix something in the system upstream the

00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,470
beginning it's cheap so for example

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,690
defense publications are very cheap very

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,120
easy to write and they could prevent

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,089
patterns from being granted trying to

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,439
bust a patent it's very expensive

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:14,839
they could take many years and many

00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:17,569
losses so i want to talk a little bit of

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,339
a bad history about em some high-profile

00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:21,920
cases which have been fought in the last

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,199
few years so microsoft vs tomtom

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,879
microsoft vs barnes and nobles microsoft

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,160
vs motorola i don't want to single out

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,259
microsoft but these are these cases have

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,389
been very very visible there are other

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:35,629
companies who have also been aggressive

00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:38,779
with these these ones got the most

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:42,170
attention so for example Microsoft

00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,059
versus barnes and nobles Barnes and

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,309
Noble is a bookshop they sell books and

00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:48,559
coffee well actually died a collocated

00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,339
with Starbucks but they sell books and

00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,809
coffee they're not a technology company

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:57,499
but they had the very successful nuke

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:59,329
tablet and Microsoft came up to them and

00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:01,490
said you know you're violating a few of

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:04,309
our patterns so what could barnes noble

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,189
do nothing they're not a technology

00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:08,720
company the only the only thing they

00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,910
could do is we're no longer going to

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,350
sell microsoft press books well no

00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:18,620
that's gonna hurt them big time not so

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,449
barnes noble had no option but to settle

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,480
with microsoft there was a very very

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,980
expensive lawsuit and forever Barnes and

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,589
Noble said no we're going to fight this

00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,779
fight this fight this and it was pretty

00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,490
sure they were there were no it was very

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,639
clear that we're going to going to lose

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,790
and then I think a few months ago by two

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,410
months ago plus it was dropped they

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,439
signed an agreement and the next version

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,230
of the nuke will not be running Linux

00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:49,939
and will we it will be a windows tablet

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:52,819
so what Microsoft did they they they use

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,949
their patents to actually make linux

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:57,259
look unsafe and force the device of the

00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,389
market a linux device of the market and

00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,279
have a bigger market share for windows

00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:06,050
tile for the windows tablets that's what

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,220
they did microsoft vs motorola was also

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,370
an interesting one i will talk about

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,920
that later on but it was all about a few

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,209
patterns that microsoft used extensively

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,519
to to push these cases namely the fat

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,860
patterns they used a few ones which are

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,660
about the fat file system

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,339
to wedge their way in and say and to

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,440
make linux look unsafe because that's

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,750
that's one of the strategies that that

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,510
companies who are doing patent lawsuits

00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,920
care about either they're into cash or

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,110
they want to force a product of the

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,529
market they want to make a competitor

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,649
look unsafe and create what they call a

00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:45,920
platform switch soul innocence is unsafe

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:49,490
switch to windows much safer that's what

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,750
some companies do they use quite a few

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:56,180
they used the fat patterns but what if

00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,149
these should never have been issued

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,269
because prior art existed so the

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:05,839
microsoft fat patterns especially

00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:08,149
especially about one pattern vfat so

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,480
those of you who used windows you

00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:13,670
probably know the 803 notation which was

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,589
then that i also had a longer notation

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,519
where you could have arbitrary long

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,290
filenames with the wiggle matilda so

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,110
they applied for a patent and actually

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,820
got it so they applied for it in 1996

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,250
and gathered about one and a half years

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,890
later and that this pattern was

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,410
challenged by many people well well not

00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,970
my bent by many people but bit by a few

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,459
companies they challenged it and said

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,560
you know this is not novel this is not

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:44,089
original there should be no pattern this

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:46,100
pen should be should be bust but it was

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,320
upheld by various courts which actually

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,660
made the pattern stronger because then

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,720
microsoft said you know these companies

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,500
they tried they gave it our best best

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,610
shot didn't work so they actually

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,490
thought you know we've got a really good

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,769
pattern and this led to a lot more

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,949
patent aggression from microsoft against

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,899
other businesses but it wasn't

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,329
definitely not innovative because in

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,660
1992 linen store vaults you might know

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,949
him he described a similar method for

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,140
the MINIX file system he never

00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:20,959
implemented it but there was someone who

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,440
asked how can we do long file names on

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,000
minix and what he said was you know we

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,390
can have a magic cookie at the end and

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,540
when a program sees that then it should

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:34,100
look in the next i know'd and then the

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,900
phone and we'll continue there and

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,150
that's exactly what Microsoft

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,150
did and this was four years before they

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,280
filed the patent so in the Microsoft vs

00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,260
motorola case this is the evidence that

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,020
that that Motorola gave and Lina's was

00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,600
actually had gone to court to give his

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:52,430
testimony and an administrative law

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,270
judge from the Federal Trade Commission

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,860
actually said this patent is not valid

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,200
Microsoft can challenge it but when a

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,350
federal when I administrative law judge

00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,590
of the Federal Trade Commission says

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,780
padded not valid it's not very well it's

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:14,540
very unlikely but someone else will

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:16,400
reinstate it so this patent is gone so

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,330
what if the Patent Office had actually

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,890
known about the idea and that Lina's had

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,350
back in the day then they probably would

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,480
never have have granted the iron granted

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:32,900
the patent in the first place but they

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:36,740
didn't know because they I am its they

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,690
didn't know it existed but if they had

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,360
they would have been a lot less for idle

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,490
index and the lawsuits that I mentioned

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,660
earlier might never have had happened

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:50,300
and Linux would have been a happier

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:52,400
place so the problem with the bad

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,990
software patents is dependent examiner I

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,540
don't want to select them personally but

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,720
they simply are overloaded there are not

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,330
domain experts and they have the various

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,630
they have very strict time constraints

00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,520
so per patent when a pattern comes in

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,060
they have to read it they have to

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,240
examine it see if there's prior art send

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,130
it back to the send it back to the

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,709
applicant and that goes on a few times

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,490
and for a patent application they have a

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:25,250
few hours so but this is not every time

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,830
the patent is sent back to the examiner

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,980
this is in total seven to eight maybe 10

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:34,130
15 hours per patent over a period of a

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,640
few years so these guys are completely

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,010
overloaded and so they they only do but

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,680
what they do is they have a few they

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,250
have a few sources that they that they

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,430
actually look at and say you know can we

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:51,200
do our sources cover this pattern yes no

00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,890
then they just you know they just take

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,520
the boxes doesn't cover do you want some

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,520
water you're fine okay so they just tick

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,590
the boxes and if it's if it's a you know

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,720
we cannot find any prior or they've done

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,260
due diligence pending the stent bank

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,630
granted if only they they had more

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,000
sources or more easily accessible

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:18,890
sources then it would be a lot easier

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,140
for them to wait to stop bad patterns

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,060
because right now there's a lot of good

00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,800
prior art out there there's a lot of

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,870
good prior art out there but they don't

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,960
see it it's like dark matter to them so

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,360
these are some examples of prior art

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,700
that are not typically searched by the

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,830
Patent Office patent offices don't have

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,290
time to go through conference

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:47,320
proceedings of scientific conferences

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:49,970
and even even so I sometimes read those

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,500
conference proceedings and within seven

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,420
to eight hours I cannot go through

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,390
sometimes a single paper because it's

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:59,750
just too tough things like technical

00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,970
reports conference talks blog posts

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,560
mailing list archives and so on these

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,910
are typically not used they only have a

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,340
very limited set of sources and this is

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:14,360
a huge problem because in here there is

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,460
a lot of good prior art so one of the

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,740
things we do is with open invention

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,950
network we try to stimulate a concept

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,000
called defensive publications and to

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:27,260
actually shine a light in this darkness

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,110
defensive publications are written like

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,510
a technical report and we put them in a

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:34,640
database that is searched by patent

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,910
examiner's ruled worldwide so we have

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,400
something like we put it in a database

00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,580
that search by 25 patent offices

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:48,140
including Europe Japan Taiwan India us

00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,540
and so on and basically you should see a

00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,870
defensive publication as very explicit

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,850
prior art written in a certain way

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,820
that's easy to search by a patent

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:01,670
examiner and you know they're easy to

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,260
write takes a few hours to get started

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,740
and after that she just you know

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,600
and down very easily and they they avoid

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,720
bad quality software patents in the

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,580
future there are actually quite a few

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,500
companies and individuals who write this

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,880
and you might see see some names and

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,840
thank you now why would these companies

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,300
student well simple filing for a patent

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,580
is expensive it actually is and there

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,470
are some companies here hero are doing

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,630
many many inventions what they usually

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,760
do they have a core invention that they

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,890
patent and then they write defense of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,620
publications around that field so no one

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,220
else can sue them for something they

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,320
have done around their core invention

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,590
IBM does this a lot I mean they publish

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,150
a lot of defensive publications Cisco

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,610
publishes a lot of defensive

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,410
publications even Microsoft does it and

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,580
quite a few others on the list it's not

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:58,430
extensive but there are quite a few

00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:00,410
companies who do this and as I said it's

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,330
very very very simple basically what you

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:06,620
what you need to do you need to have a

00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,210
title one or two pages of text if figure

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,910
describing interactions between the

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,590
components and that's it you know if he

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,650
can describe your ID in a mailing list

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,960
or in a pub to someone else or a blog

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,340
post then you've got any of Khalid

00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,000
you've got basically a defensive

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:25,010
publication that's all it takes and if

00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,920
you're not confident that you can write

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:33,100
one will glad gladly assist so here's an

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,080
example I don't expect you to read it

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,850
but as did did so this is one of the

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,660
examples someday limits defenders web

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:47,180
page as you can see it's quite so it has

00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:51,260
a title a few paragraphs of text and a

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:54,320
figure and that's it that's what we put

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,070
out to to patent examiner's worldwide

00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:04,700
and say now this is now explicit prior

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:06,620
art so then always is the question and

00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,570
what when I'm talking to developers they

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,550
say you know with the stuff that I'm

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,500
making its trivial and it's not very

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,690
novel and all that and we don't care you

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,970
know so what is a good

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,100
moment to write a defensive publication

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,810
and I always say if it keeps you awake

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,340
at night if you cannot sleep anymore

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,400
because you've got such a good idea

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,160
that's exactly a good moment in to write

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,960
a defense of publication mean so the

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,820
coders out there you know that moment

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,070
when you cannot sleep anymore you want

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,930
to tell all your friends at 4am like you

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,930
know this is what I've done this is what

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,640
I came up with do you think it's good

00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:48,370
that's a really good moment but at any

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:52,270
moment is basically okay to do it so

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:54,640
what's in it for you well basically what

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,770
did the main thing is freedom to operate

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,360
around your own design around your own

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,600
event you not get getting sued for

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:04,960
something you came up with fewer bad

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,700
software patents that never should have

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,130
been issued in the first place that's in

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,690
it for you also a publication number

00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,980
each publication each defense of

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,340
publication will be assigned a number

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:17,140
you can put it on your CV and for some

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,690
people that's actually important I like

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,300
it because then you can show you know I

00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,540
took care of this I know about this

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,480
stuff and I actually had the balls to do

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,450
this and protect my my invention and

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,090
also we've got these special nerd merit

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,850
badges it's you can if you write a few

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:40,360
defensive publications it'll get one of

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:43,450
these as well and filing is it no cost

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,060
so I'm at least for you the website we

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:51,190
found IP com the charge is something but

00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:53,230
we pick pick up the bill but that's not

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,670
not everything you can do there's a lot

00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,560
more if you don't like software patents

00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,010
and there's a lot more that you can do

00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,640
for example help bust patents or at

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:09,610
least get claims narrowed or join Owens

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:11,740
Community so this in September 16 the US

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:14,170
Patent Office they actually allow people

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,650
to submit prior art to the Patent Office

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:20,020
for patent applications and this is

00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,390
called pre grant submission it's fairly

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,900
new we don't know yet how this will work

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,640
out but it came from a from an

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,710
initiative called peer to patent which

00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,729
we used to run with together with a few

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,009
other organism

00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:37,589
it is a step up from what it used to be

00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:40,769
but still it's it's a bit limited they

00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:44,129
allow up to three pieces of prior art

00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:47,779
per person without charge and the Patent

00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:50,489
Office can always decide to ignore it so

00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,349
we're currently playing with it a little

00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,299
bit and we're going to run a few trials

00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,009
and what we need to do is would be when

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,929
we want to work with people with domain

00:24:56,009 --> 00:25:01,289
experts to find some really good prior

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:04,049
art so we submit it to the Patent Office

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:05,999
and because we have we want to have

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:10,259
really good priority just simply cannot

00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:13,349
ignore it and said we don't know yet how

00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:16,499
this will work out we will start

00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:18,449
learning in the next few months but if

00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:20,459
you if you like to bust patents and

00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:24,719
please come up to me and say yeah I like

00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:27,389
to work on this and also you can join

00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:29,429
open invention networks community so

00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:31,940
what we have we have a cross-licensing

00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,979
program between companies and projects

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,309
the only thing we do we ask companies

00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:40,499
and projects to pledge non-aggression of

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,449
all of pat of you know for patents on

00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:45,359
just a limited set of Linux packages

00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:47,519
about 1,800 packages we ask people do

00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,609
not sue for patents on these packages

00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,979
and in return they get the the same

00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:55,169
promise back from about 500 500

00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:56,549
companies and projects including some

00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,499
very big ones like Facebook Twitter

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:02,940
Cisco HP Google economical and and a

00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:07,440
whole bunch of others and also some

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,999
product projects like katie ingram apart

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,190
from that they get an unlimited patent

00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:13,109
license to open invention networks own

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,559
patterns because yes we do have patterns

00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:18,929
and all this is at no cost so if you

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,229
have a company say you know i actually

00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:26,009
want to protect my myself a bit better

00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:28,319
against against pattern threats you know

00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:33,719
just come up to me and we'll make it

00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:36,769
work and that's it so i would like to

00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:36,769
open up the floor for questions

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,560
any questions yes click could you wait

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,560
for the mic

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,530
how many engineers does it take to get

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,450
you to a mic sorry do do any background

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,340
checks on the submissions because

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,980
normally when you submit the patent and

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,810
that is all the patent granted before

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,990
that for the same thing the patent

00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,630
office refuses that so do I drink some

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,040
checks from you mean mean for defense of

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:31,570
publication yep no we don't because it's

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,580
the only thing that can happen if there

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,370
is a defensive publication a defensive

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,790
publication is not a patent it's just a

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:41,530
document describing prior art and we

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,060
don't do background checks because first

00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,880
of all that would would mean that we

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,550
would have to be on the judges chair

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,590
which we don't want to because many

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,390
patent claims are very vague so what

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:55,180
happens is that actually a judge has to

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,770
rule whether or not a patent is

00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,560
infringed we don't want to be in that

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,080
position furthermore the only thing that

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,790
can happen is that if if a defense of

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,390
publication is submitted for which

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,220
already a patent exists well basically

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:12,970
nothing changes because the pattern was

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:15,220
already there so we cannot help to to

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,410
bust the old patent with it with with

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,020
some new prior art but we can prevent

00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:21,250
things from the future from happening so

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,750
yeah that will be it that will be a

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:25,590
little bit of weight a waste of time and

00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:29,650
effort but there would be no harm done

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,840
so we don't do background checks because

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,770
defense publications are much simpler we

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,930
don't want to do a legal interpretation

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:47,200
so and there's no real harm done if the

00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:49,630
if there is already a patent unless

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,940
somebody relies on the fact that it's

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:54,750
been published as a defensive

00:28:51,940 --> 00:29:01,810
publication and then boom a year later

00:28:54,750 --> 00:29:05,860
you have already am pardoned sorry I so

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:07,930
well I don't so if there's already a

00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,970
patent and we published the offense of

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,110
publication and then a year later work

00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:15,660
but yes there is a patent you know

00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,680
thousands of patents so somebody

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,450
publishes a defensive publication

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,830
because he didn't found

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,799
one pattern that he's actually

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,990
describing that's or being granted

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,700
somebody think so seq ID M is been

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,610
published as a defensive publication I

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,730
can use that and then a year later a

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,110
bill comes from the patent lawyer

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,000
stating you're violating this patent and

00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,630
I don't Carol it has been published or

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,360
not we have had the present earlier

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,460
right so two things first of all that

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,500
that already is stuff like that has

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,260
already happened with things like people

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,490
tracking version control systems and

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,769
actually filing patents that has

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,779
happened in the past so yeah it's a risk

00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,340
but what we do we actually file the

00:29:55,779 --> 00:30:00,159
defense of publications in a database

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:04,000
called IP com which is a digital notary

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,549
and this this database is actually

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,440
actively being searched by the US patent

00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,960
office so we can then we can always

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,490
appeal but yeah you know there is a risk

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,789
that someone would say we track these

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,380
defensive publications and and I just

00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,330
change this a little bit but that's also

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,570
indicates with patterns it's the case

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:27,220
with anything you publish with anything

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:29,320
you can do so and also if you are afraid

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,029
of being of writing in defense of

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,830
publication and afraid that you will be

00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,559
sued by someone else because you

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:38,500
infringe under patent you can always

00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:42,610
submit a noun anonymously so we do have

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:45,279
anonymous submissions if you want to but

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:47,620
yet the problem you described is real

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,870
but its not inherent to defensive

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,590
publications you have it with everything

00:30:49,870 --> 00:31:00,370
I mean blog posts microblogging I don't

00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:02,019
know stuff you say on IRC so I think

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,970
that that defense publications they are

00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:07,169
there they have a real value proposition

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,730
it's a it's a good method to prevent

00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:17,559
bats and quality software patents in the

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:21,460
future yes so what do you recommend if

00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:26,320
the hold of a patent grants you

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:29,190
permission to use the same technology to

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,190
re-implement it

00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:37,989
I'm not a lawyer so um if someone has

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,269
given you a patent grant and then also

00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:43,359
has granted you the right to distribute

00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:47,169
it so I'm basically giving everyone a

00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:52,089
pattern a pattern grand is that what you

00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:54,609
mean no Larry's I know a software and to

00:31:52,089 --> 00:32:00,190
technology I don't know which part of it

00:31:54,609 --> 00:32:02,859
is patented and it is windows paste but

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:08,190
we actually wanted linux-based or also a

00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:08,190
linux version of it but they will not

00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:15,579
develop it but they will grant us

00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:20,739
permission to implement it for linux and

00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:24,969
also redistributed under say the GPL we

00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:28,299
wanted yes as I actually didn't feel

00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:31,209
well where are you based hmm where are

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:33,669
you based austria we should hook you up

00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:35,739
with a lawyer i think fun we should hook

00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:37,959
you up with a lawyer this come to me

00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:39,879
afterwards now i will make connections

00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:42,070
with a lawyer it's much easier I'm not a

00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:44,829
lawyer so I kya I cannot I cannot answer

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:48,849
that question right now sorry okay but

00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:57,519
well I'll hook you up thank you any more

00:32:48,849 --> 00:33:01,169
questions no more questions I'd like to

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,169
