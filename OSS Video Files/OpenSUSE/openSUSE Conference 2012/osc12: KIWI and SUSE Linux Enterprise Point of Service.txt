welcome to the presentation of TV and

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:36,059
slippers so what is kV and what is Susan

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,360
linux enterprise point of service I've

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,739
prepared for you its agenda for this

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,800
presentation and we will start this

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,190
presentation with a quick overview of

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,890
given imaging system and then proceed

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,660
however we use it in suse linux

00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:04,799
enterprise point of service so what is

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:09,150
ki b ki v is an imaging system images

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:13,020
the images system with the basic

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,390
workflow that first configuration file

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:22,080
is prepared channels with the packages

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:25,770
is configured and then we just build the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,799
system I prepared this presentation

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,250
mainly for the people from the business

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:38,600
so but I see that most of you are from

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:42,689
sousa and development so I will try to

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:48,210
go through this business information

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:51,899
quickly and maybe proceed then with the

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,110
technical information later I would like

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,939
to keep this presentation interactive so

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,610
any time you would like to learn

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,960
something more do you have any questions

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,960
don't hesitate to interrupt

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:14,320
with Gibby we can build many different

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:19,890
kind of images very often these are life

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:23,890
systems deployed on the USB sticks or

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:27,760
delivered by ISIL and also we can build

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:33,040
virtual images but for our solution the

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:36,940
most interesting are pixie images and om

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,520
images so what is Suzanne Linux

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:43,600
Enterprise point of service and tell how

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,900
we use GV in peace solution suse linux

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,610
enterprise point of service is just a

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,490
small adan that is deployed on top of

00:02:50,610 --> 00:03:03,000
standard slice 11 no installation with

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:06,850
the intention to create infrastructure

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,330
that can help our customers to deploy

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:16,120
large set of clients there are three

00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,400
layers of this infrastructure in the

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,459
beginning the administration server is

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,100
prepared and complete configuration of

00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:31,150
the deployment and the clients is

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:34,030
created in the LD AP and also images

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,170
that will be later deployed on the

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,650
clients are prepared on the admin server

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:47,769
and start also on the enemy server once

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:51,220
this preparation is finished we proceed

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:54,010
with the synchronization of this

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,390
configuration and of the images to the

00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:05,730
branches where the branch servers are

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:09,360
located peace branch servers are located

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:13,780
generally in each store where the

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,550
clients will be run later and after the

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,200
branch servers have

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:23,180
I've been provided with all those

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,990
informations you just plug in the cash

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:31,430
register into the branch server which by

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:37,670
a pixie deploys automatically the system

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:40,370
and start working so these are quick

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:44,650
facts about sue's onyx enterprise point

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:48,650
of service adminserver brain server and

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,740
image creator which can be combined for

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,680
small installations with admin server or

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:59,660
for large installations where more

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:08,230
images expected can be run on a separate

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:11,480
server these are the highlight points y

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:15,110
souza linux enterprise a point of

00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:20,000
service is preferred from linux

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:24,580
customers who use it it is a very

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,200
efficient way how to move very quickly

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,410
also in the pre-sale to work proof of

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,710
concept and also to administrate

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:40,670
administrate and configure the system

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:45,740
later this is a quick and fast overview

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:49,940
of all products that Souza is providing

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,720
to our customers today and SUSE Linux

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:59,440
Enterprise point-of-service cooperates

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:02,480
and when also with other to product to

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,750
repair a portfolio for our post

00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:11,180
solutions this is a suitor studio and

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:16,780
Suzie manager so TV is the tool that can

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:20,480
create the images and as a convenient

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,430
graphical user interface in image

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,700
creator last module can be used or a

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,590
so sue the studio can be used to build

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:38,350
the images and also to use a large

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:45,270
variety of prepared appliances Susan

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:51,040
manager can be used to page monitor

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:57,960
configure and administrate the large set

00:06:51,040 --> 00:07:02,850
of clients deployed by sleep off with a

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,850
user-friendly graphical user interface

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:13,300
so this is our portfolio of products

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:18,130
that is positioned to serve the needs of

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:23,320
the customers in the retail market so

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:26,770
now few details about suse linux

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,580
enterprise point-of-service 11 service

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:34,290
back to this service pack 2 has been

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:39,940
released in april this year and be

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:46,170
prepared large set of features to help

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:53,170
our customers to use this solution

00:07:46,170 --> 00:08:00,100
efficiently we try and do our best to

00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:04,240
keep the tools on the same version now

00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,940
over the three products that use them

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,390
this is a slice Susan's enterprise

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,930
server souza linux enterprise point of

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:20,470
service and also sue the studio to keep

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:26,230
the compatibility this is a very

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:30,940
interesting part of our latest evolution

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:34,690
and to bert service pack 3 we introduce

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,390
the feature pack concept so what is

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,470
feature pack

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:43,490
concept very often happens that

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:47,790
customers require enhancement that

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:50,240
nichelle materialize quicker than 18

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,900
months between the service packs and

00:08:50,240 --> 00:09:02,510
therefore we move to word sleep OC 11 SB

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:02,510
3 with the concept of feature pack

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:11,370
definition of future pike are mainly to

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:17,340
deliver the enhancement within the

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:21,470
period of service pack and also to meet

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,390
the market demands of course with the

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:29,220
restrictions that must be met because

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:33,780
between the service pack releases we

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:36,620
cannot influence other product so within

00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:41,130
these feature packs we just introduce

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:47,310
new enhancement in ped had no impact on

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:50,730
other products and of course to proceed

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:56,130
consistently these enhancements built

00:09:50,730 --> 00:10:02,150
logical complexes therefore feature pack

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:08,520
wanna know maybe confusing about to Burt

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:11,990
sp3 we still use the label sp2 because

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,380
these features are built on top of sp2

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:19,290
therefore we name this new feature pack

00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,720
one asleep of silliman sp2 feature pack

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:26,790
one this has been released in August

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:30,140
this year and the main reason for this

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:36,860
feature pack was the introduction of

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:42,360
wireless deployment of the client to

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:45,830
bring to implement this feature we had

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,830
also need to

00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:52,850
we had also to implement fuel related

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,410
features we introduced the service

00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:04,600
partition and as a consequence please

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:08,450
enabled us also to introduce transfer of

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:14,230
multicast images by a multicast tftp and

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:19,100
because we now enable also the wireless

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:24,200
interface we oughta know automatically

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:29,230
configure our available network adapters

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:33,190
in the system if you have no more

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:39,620
technical questions I would like to

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:43,400
appoint you also to the project manager

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:46,250
of sleepers you are compact and also to

00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:54,740
team lead of the sleep esteem hearing /

00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:57,470
crater of shuttle then we proceed with

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,730
the feature pack tool which has been

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:05,870
released beginning of the October and

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:09,260
mainly be prepared now materials and

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,410
documentation for our sales engineers to

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:15,950
move toward a proof-of-concept faster

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:18,560
because not only our sales engineers but

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:22,040
also engineers from our customers and

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:26,750
partner very often complains very often

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:30,680
complain that sleep oz is very complex

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:34,580
and hard to learn which is in the end

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:40,730
true because sleep asst is very flexible

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:44,090
and customizable and it is not from the

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,690
dead easy for the beginners to go

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:54,430
through all these details and prepare

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:54,430
the first installation quickly

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:02,650
so this is the most important part of

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:08,590
the presentation wireless client so

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:11,690
virus clients got one specific because

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:17,000
there is no big c booting available for

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:22,310
wireless adapters as we are used in the

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,650
network ethernet adapters and my

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:32,140
understanding is that this is mainly

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:36,920
because of the security concerns because

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,950
the well when the wireless client would

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,140
like to proceed with pixie booting it

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:48,440
must connect first to an access point

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:54,080
wait the full encryption and full

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:59,150
security of course so therefore we

00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:03,380
decided to proceed with two steps which

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:08,870
in the end the pixie booting provides by

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:13,400
default because when the images are

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:16,820
built pixie images are built with TV the

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:22,750
first stage so-called boot image is

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:26,780
created and then the second stage is the

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:30,680
system image so the procedure of big

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:35,150
supporting is to download from the

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:39,440
server via pixie first stage of boot

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:42,980
image kernel and eat rd started and then

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:50,090
proceed downloading the system image and

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:54,940
deploy it so during the our feature pack

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:59,680
1 we prepared a solution how to create

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:04,889
the boot image with pre-configured

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:11,740
wireless which

00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:17,949
deployed in a service partition so when

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:23,680
the client starts then the client boot

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:26,829
piece boot image from the service

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,670
partition connects to the access point

00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:33,850
and proceeds with deployment of the

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,300
system image from the branch server as

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:45,509
it was exactly the way as it was before

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:49,089
via standard pixie process so this is

00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:54,759
generally the end of the presentation

00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:58,740
and I would like to ask you if you just

00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:02,079
provide you with a few more information

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:06,389
four thousand and interested and also

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,389
would like to ask you for the questions

00:16:48,890 --> 00:17:00,920
yes exactly so our customers come at the

00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:00,920
moment from their retail business as

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:11,250
example for example co-op in switzerland

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,000
is using our salt solution also large

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:21,030
retailers in the united states and other

00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:25,170
retailers across europe so despite the

00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:29,520
fact that we are talking about cash

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:34,980
registers or else this solution is of

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:39,960
course generally usable for all kind of

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:44,010
devices that can pick C boot or n boot

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,700
also wireless either they are cash

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:55,559
registers or thin clients and of course

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:59,210
any other devices that using Linux one

00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:06,960
of the possibilities is of course and

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:11,700
maybe can be expected a large usage of

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:18,290
the artist solution also in the oil

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:25,640
market because a large set of any

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:29,070
embedded Linux devices shall be

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,110
configured very quickly efficiently

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,250
without manual installation then just

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,180
the

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:44,840
boot image shall be prepared delivered

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:48,540
to the manufacturer and just deployed

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,370
within the manufacturing process of

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,600
course with the cooperation of the

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,980
potential customer who delivers the

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,980
configuration of the access points and

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,150
then just roll out the large set of

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:06,660
clients which know when switched on the

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:10,080
place just connects downloads the image

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,110
which is a flexible method of deployment

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,150
of the system image and start operate

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,150
the way as the customer expects

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:34,979
yes so the updates is something that we

00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:40,399
deal very often very quickly and is it

00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:44,450
default requirement by our customers so

00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:48,210
sleep owes automatically provides the

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:54,619
clients with the updates this way that

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:57,419
when the client starts restarts or boots

00:19:54,619 --> 00:20:01,979
automatically checks with the branch

00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:04,830
server if there is update of the system

00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:08,279
image and if there is one automatically

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:13,950
downloads deploys this new image with

00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:29,849
and this process is transparent to the

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:31,879
user so basically for you you have to

00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:34,349
think of all that solution is being

00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:37,019
suitable for all kind of mass

00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:39,570
deployments so we also have customers

00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,080
that have have desktops they're in a

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:45,809
bank that's that's kind of working

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,169
everything you can configure with our

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:51,659
imaging tools you can deliver the

00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:55,080
general way to delivering is is kind of

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:58,139
I gets arcing from from the central

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,099
office to the branch offices which can

00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:04,429
work disconnected and which have a a

00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:08,009
replica ldap server running so they do

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:10,320
replicate part of the ellip tree and the

00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:13,489
central configuration and from there

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,440
this works as a pixie boots server or

00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:18,929
now with that service partition you can

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,629
imagine of all kinds of dirty things you

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:24,509
can do because yeah you can kind of

00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:27,119
reconfigure the image the o image put it

00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:31,379
put it on the on the client just from

00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:33,960
from the fab and you can right now we

00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:36,089
have we have it tailored for wireless

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,140
support out of the box but you could

00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:40,680
also take

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,900
learn it out of four VPN support out of

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,880
the box or other things anything you can

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,460
do with the Linux kernel you can put it

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,530
in an any dirty you can put it on the

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,430
service partition and can come up out of

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:55,950
the box like that so that's kind of its

00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:58,800
it's pretty flexible in that way so

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,290
everything you can every organization

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,470
you can fit in that central approach

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,030
where where you might be disconnected

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,340
between the branch server and the admin

00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,650
server from time to time you can deliver

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,580
it like that so the updates number one

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:17,010
yes the idea is going through images but

00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,340
what you can do we have this this user

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,290
manager product which also is for

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,140
delivering images and for keeping

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:28,440
inventory stuff and so so the future

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:32,040
idea is if you like to you can configure

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,070
on the end the image side and put also

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,070
the RPM stack on it onto the image then

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:41,520
you can work through regular updates but

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,440
the idea currently is we have an smt

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,720
server running a side with the on the

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,500
array the admin server and the past

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,030
image server so that automatically pulls

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,940
the updates and you just have to

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:59,040
recreate the image and and deliver it so

00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:03,840
that's it pretty easy in the end of this

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:08,940
boils down the two decision of the

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:12,330
customer if he would like to keep just

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:19,760
this simple solution or also to use

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:22,760
advanced tool like to like Susan manager

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,760
custom

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:38,720
for example setting setting so can the

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:41,610
initial boot that service image also

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,640
customized for the individual device

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:48,360
because you often have a general image

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,550
which has for example all series heroes

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,400
in the serial number and the serial

00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:56,550
number is also set because you need some

00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:01,290
information for the center stage what

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:05,180
should it set for example yes so there

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:10,160
are three groups of clients now this is

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:15,570
default group then the client can be

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:19,470
individually set up by a mac address and

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:24,030
there is also a third option which is

00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:30,270
based on the hardware info from the from

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:35,310
the bios so group of configuration can

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:40,110
be assigned to this special group of

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:42,420
hardware this is a standard procedure

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:47,420
how to configure this large set of

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:50,070
clients and it is stored in lv AP and

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,550
recently we introduced the configuration

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:57,290
by xml so this kind of configuration is

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,290
pretty straightforward and easy

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:17,230
say say you want to change the password

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:21,970
of CBP avis vp a password is it then

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:24,820
easy to to configure then you the new

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:30,550
password by installing a new service

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:34,930
partition there are few possibilities

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:38,050
how to deal with that first I would like

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:41,830
to mention that i would recommend to the

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:47,140
customers to use the wireless deployment

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:51,670
by two stages first would be to prepare

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:56,350
one access point with general access the

00:25:51,670 --> 00:26:00,040
data and password and then once the

00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:05,590
system is deployed then just reconfigure

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:09,580
it for daily use to another probably

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:12,010
more secure password but thinner any

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:18,520
kind of scenarios the second possibility

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:21,990
is of course if this password is

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:25,420
compromised and has already been set and

00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:30,550
let's say hardwired in the boot image

00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:33,300
there is a second option there the

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:39,340
customer can set the encryption

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:42,280
parameters SSID and password on the

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:47,430
colonel runs drink so justing to

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:50,980
interrupt the booting process and put

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:59,170
customized passwords and SSID on the

00:26:50,980 --> 00:27:02,830
colonel command line but of course the

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,400
advantage of automatic configuration is

00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,400
lost then

00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:22,129
by the way or two with the WPA

00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:27,669
encryption it is the wireless transfer

00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:32,269
is more secure but when it comes to a

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:37,450
enterprise deployment I would recommend

00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:43,429
to use just the WPA EAP with back-end

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:45,979
radios and setting certificates so this

00:27:43,429 --> 00:28:01,309
is the current best solution how to

00:27:45,979 --> 00:28:04,119
secure wireless any other questions so

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,119
