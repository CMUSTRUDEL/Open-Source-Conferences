	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,370
um so welcome to the networking round

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:18,690
table um I have suggested to have a buff

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,630
on this um I think there are two or

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,609
three things which we should discuss so

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:29,189
I think both bubble and we made a pretty

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,460
strong case that what we have today is

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,370
not good enough so in a manner of

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,059
speaking well we both said scripting

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,500
isn't really cutting edge anymore and

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:42,629
you said well you need to rewrite

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,719
network manager quite a bit and you want

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,100
to do a lot of things and we also have a

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,149
lot of things that we would like to

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,370
change so i guess the kind of questions

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,289
that i have and maybe you have as well

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:01,160
is a what do people think in the

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,870
community where we should be going and

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:22,860
how things should be looking and where

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:24,659
the focus should be I was too late for

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,659
the network manager talk so I'm

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,329
100-percent sure but what this was all

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,350
about but when i see that you starred in

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:37,860
wicked again implementing stuff that's

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:40,740
surely not server specific i mean i'm

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,020
wondering wouldn't it be best if network

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,990
manager basically focused on the desktop

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,619
put it and and we get focused on the

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:55,290
server and so is it necessary that

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,869
wicked grows UMTS modem support and it's

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,810
just that that came to my mind when when

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,299
looking at is i'm not sure if it's if

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,479
it's possible to separate out completely

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:12,000
say okay I'm there are probably some

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:13,350
features in in the the the the wireless

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,050
wpa authentic a

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,610
asian stuff is also used on wired office

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,200
networks and so it's probably not so

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,200
easy to separate this out and you might

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
also need is on boxes that are running a

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,920
servers in some networks I'm not sure

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,990
about that so the question is if it's

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,360
even possible to say okay network

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,980
manager is for only for desktops and

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,320
wicked is only for service because of

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,520
course you cannot you cannot dictate who

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,190
runs what we're that's the one thing and

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:46,560
but what what if it would be good to

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:49,830
focus more on well let's do it the one

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,970
part of the problem in in this piece of

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,230
software and the other part of the

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,400
problem in the other piece of software

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm not sure about that if that's yeah I

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,070
was surprised to see that we could

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:08,640
already grew the UMTS support let's put

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:11,430
it like that yeah okay 11 comment to

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,810
that from my side and hand to you that

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,060
second I mean for me it was an exercise

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,340
to see how well the concepts worked to

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,390
try to support both server side stuff

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:30,720
and some client side stuff and that was

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:33,870
my main motivation there unfortunately I

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,290
think this is entirely impossible to

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:41,160
separate and this is our conclusion at

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,290
fedora and red hat this is because we

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,890
have lots of applications that actually

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,990
rely on the networking layer so I don't

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,640
know I I might come up with just my

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:55,950
personal example when I go tomorrow I'm

00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,270
working at home but yeah I have I have a

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:03,660
laptop at home and yeah sometimes I

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,970
connected to ethernet sometimes I do

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:11,130
connected to Wi-Fi I'm starting VPN on

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,980
top of it to get to the corporate

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,070
network but I'm doing network

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,310
development that means for it I need

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,260
some visualization so yeah I need

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,130
pitching I need visualization on top of

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,850
it so my use case exactly one of those

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,270
that

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,830
you cover server you cover router

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,940
because you have to route for the

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,880
visualization host and you also cover

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,120
the desktop case because I'm just going

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:47,070
around with the laptop so no we cannot

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,090
separate it and maybe maybe the other

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,310
question was whether network manager can

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,440
can do just the desktop stuff no it's

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,540
it's not no longer possible for us to

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
just stick with the desktop stuff

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,760
because we need to extend to the other

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,830
use cases and really just one network

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,620
management demon and not not two of them

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,680
and not do interfacing with with many of

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,850
them I don't mean it globally of course

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:19,530
yes Suh said people can can have their

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,990
wicked or whatever but you know for one

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,230
distribution we need to have just one

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,860
default networking demon that will work

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,900
with the other tools and currently I

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,120
wouldn't say it works actually yeah it

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,820
sort of works yeah i have i have my

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,450
branch with some things fixed for myself

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,420
it's some things are already merged to

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,510
the official line some things are not

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,780
ready to be merged so yeah it's it's a

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,690
long way to to get it but i think it's

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,160
our ultimate goal to support all these

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,980
cases server desktop and light or or

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,600
easy easy outing or something what we

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,180
are not covering with network manager is

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,190
is firewalling because we expect other

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:11,490
tools to be cooperating with network

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:16,110
manager so that's it thank you I think

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:20,010
our um target is the model server part

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:25,620
um and we want to support also for

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:29,730
example advanced routing um and um yeah

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,850
we would like to have also a some-some

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:35,700
icon on the desktop where the user which

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,969
is developing it has some notebook and

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,009
starts virtual machines on the notebook

00:06:38,969 --> 00:07:00,269
on can use it also to connect to the

00:06:41,009 --> 00:07:02,399
internet but they are the story ends i'm

00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:05,099
sorry i missed your previous

00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,869
presentation but can you tell me what's

00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:20,369
the need for a network manager on the

00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:23,279
server ok um the reason to have that is

00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:28,049
that there's a number of things that are

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:30,749
no longer purely static so you have to

00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:33,209
react to events from the network so it

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:36,360
starts with things with simple things in

00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:38,879
ipv6 the router advertisements tell you

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,369
whether you should just configure a

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,379
bunch of prefixes on this device and

00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:45,479
then be done with it or whether there is

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:48,209
additional information to be retrieved

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,309
from the dhcp server for instance and

00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:53,519
there's a bother a bunch of other things

00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:55,649
like what do you do when a prefix

00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,169
expires what do you do when the routing

00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:01,289
changes and so on which happens in ipv6

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,019
so there is the network is no longer a

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,629
static thing that oh yeah maybe once it

00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,699
changes every year but then we just go

00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:10,919
around and kick all the boxes no it's

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,919
much more dynamic and you have to be

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,869
there and actually listen to the net

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,569
link events that the colonel sends you

00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:21,439
to detect that something changed and

00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,439
take the appropriate action

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:35,610
um do we have other examples mario's I'm

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:38,789
sure we do for example the ACP on the

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:41,760
two interfaces if you have to ethernet

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,900
interfaces and you have dhcp there must

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,720
be some demon that decides which default

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,140
route will be actually used you can do

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,820
this with the edge client if you run it

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,180
on all the interface at the same time

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,340
but then it's a network demon then it's

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,740
doing some configuration I think the H

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,200
client even can assign a static

00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,290
addresses so yes it has built in some

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,440
functionality of the network manager or

00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,360
wicked or any other network dimmer but

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,820
with network manager at least we are

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,120
trying to avoid using it and we are

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:20,550
actually actually preventing the D H

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,740
clients from doing anything to the

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:28,770
colonel so for us d h client is just an

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:34,410
information retrieval demon so we split

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:36,960
this up I believe in the UNIX way so the

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,820
th client does exactly what is what it's

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,910
supposed to do get the information and

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,910
network manager or a replacement can

00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:47,640
invert the colonel and the policy and it

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,520
is configuration so it has a way to

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:55,320
decide which ethernet is preferred 10

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,150
which is not thank you yeah okay that

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,580
pretty much echoes what we're doing the

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,410
dhcp area except that we just rewrote

00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:09,470
the thing because we wanted to do it

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:16,260
faster yeah yeah I mean took the end so

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:18,750
well um in another yeah yeah another

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,490
another reason for having a demon is

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,530
that you cannot boot your system and

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,930
configure them the networking has one

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,089
big blob any longer so that's no fun

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,620
anymore you've seen the complexity up

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,900
there and if you put all these pieces

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,420
together booting the whole thing will

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,420
take forever and we're just struggling

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,240
to make

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,490
make things boot fast right so what you

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,980
really want to do is you want to break

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:47,710
up network configuration into smaller

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,200
things and take a more service like

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,660
approach that also rhymes better with

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,610
what's this so not like oh yeah let's go

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,530
and wait for everything to be ready and

00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,140
then we say okay we're ready for it for

00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,580
service but really I think you want to

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,430
break it down into smaller components

00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,500
and say okay first interface that comes

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,060
up we check whether actually the NFS

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,760
server is reachable and then we start

00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,920
mounting our NFS volumes as soon as that

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,290
stuff is available and then we can

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,410
proceed no matter what the wireless

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,180
interface is doing or this VPN thingy or

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,130
whatever nobody cares about it as long

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,800
as we don't have to send any traffic

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,540
across it right and so this is also

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,630
something that needs a central

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,550
controlling instance that says okay I'm

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,140
going to flip these five switches but if

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,520
that one comes up I'll send out an

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,740
announcement and then the rest of the

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,780
game can continue so there's a lot of

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,940
benefit in having that and once you

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,770
start looking into this it pops up

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:54,760
everywhere where it says oh yeah okay

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:58,680
that's a good idea okay as a network

00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:01,180
developer how do you manage having

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,760
network manager running but at the same

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,470
time I'm sure it often is the case that

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
you want to quickly reconfigure

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,790
something or you know manually configure

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,220
an interface or start change their

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,190
routing parameters and so on and in

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:19,630
those cases well does that happen to you

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,340
I guess it does how do you what's the

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,130
word flow so that you don't interfere

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:29,590
and step on each other's toe with regard

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:36,370
to network manager guess that's for you

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:38,620
Pavel currently I must admit that when

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,950
I'm when I'm testing some networking

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,880
stuff and I don't want network manager

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:50,610
interfere I just turn it off but our

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,890
plan is to let network manager just

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:58,200
CD networking changes accept them and

00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:02,010
not not to step on them but it's not as

00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,320
easy we'll we'll have we'll still have

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,920
lots of dogs about it and lots of lots

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,660
of discussions but the basic stuff is

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,220
that if you for example at an IP address

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,950
currently sometimes network manager

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:22,620
keeps it sometimes it destroys it and I

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,680
must admit that I don't know the

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,990
circumstances and that I actually tried

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,110
to find this out from from the current

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,690
code and this is one of the reasons I'm

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:38,070
rewriting it because it's impossible so

00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:41,180
the code is so bad that we really need

00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:45,649
to have this this written from scratch

00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:50,329
maybe to be more to be more precise

00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:53,220
imagine you have lots of C code files

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:56,250
that are maintaining coats of various

00:13:53,220 --> 00:14:00,410
stuff including wireless including you

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,440
know bonding including DNS staff and

00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:08,040
every of these files can have a call to

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,350
change something in the colonel so what

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,000
what we are trying to achieve now is

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,899
that there will be only one place that

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,510
will manage the colonel staff and that

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,459
we will see all the changes that we like

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:24,260
you'll see all the changes that we don't

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:26,880
like we want to start with the testing

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,610
that will prove that network manager

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,980
does what it should do and the next step

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,560
will be to detect any other changes and

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,660
reject reject the tests if that

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,230
organizer does something more than it

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,709
should do so yes currently it's

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:47,550
impossible currently even even I to turn

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:49,740
off network manager at times but in

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:54,079
future we want to avoid this and we want

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,079
to work with your local changes

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:08,710
um so one question about wicked on we

00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,120
checked some of the logs and you talked

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,770
about you know how you configure the

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,480
network IP addresses ipv6 ipv4 but when

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,740
I have a complicated network topology I

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
have another problem it's called name

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,380
resolution um so do you tie into you

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,650
know DNS set up as well because if my

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,680
VPN is up i need some part of the net of

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,390
the network resolution to switch and you

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,310
know when my local network comes up by

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,900
one some name resolution to happen there

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,610
and stuff like that it said also covered

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:44,200
or set something else entirely um so

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:47,500
there is the the idea exists and there

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:52,090
is some preliminary support which is you

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,370
can listen to changes in the DNS

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,020
configuration so whenever we install a

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,110
new lease that we received from

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,670
somewhere we send out an event that well

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,700
we have a new lease the network

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,860
configuration change and then you can

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,680
actually go and try to resolve your name

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,370
and even try to reach it or try to

00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:15,040
connect to it and see what happens that

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,770
those checks exist these are essentially

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,630
two checks rolled in 11 is trying to do

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,950
the dns resolution and the other is

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:25,900
trying routability so you don't really

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,940
connect by a tcp but you do a UDP

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,800
connect which tells you whether the

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,470
local routing table actually has a clue

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,620
where it would send the packages if you

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,930
if you actually try to of course you can

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,640
make that more complex but for now that

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,460
is the extent of what we have and

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,320
certainly given that we are moving to

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,270
enter more and more into a system d

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,150
world where you have these different

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:58,570
stages of happiness during your boot

00:16:49,150 --> 00:17:00,040
then I'm sorry to hear that and we know

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,600
we're not going to repeat that for the

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,760
recording but essentially trying to play

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,010
well in the system d world also means

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,260
that you want to

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:17,440
events notifying you of such changes

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,660
yeah so I think yeah Robert and how'd

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:27,490
you also wanted to ask something so i

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:30,220
guess it's her out first sorry Robert so

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,470
both groups worked lots say it a lot and

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,020
my feeling is you look at each other's

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,050
code if you look at us as code what you

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:45,790
like about and have you think about

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:53,700
combined forces okay do you want to go

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:56,380
first or me okay um I have to say um

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,200
what Pavel said in his presentation

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,540
today that is stuff I like much more

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,800
than what I have seen in the code up to

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:09,520
now so I think there is potential to

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,500
collaborate my personal experience with

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,300
network manager during the past couple

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,060
of years was a little different but I'm

00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,190
seeing I'm seeing him say the right

00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,230
things and actually a lot of our

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:28,420
motivation seems to be along the same

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:30,010
lines and I guess if we sit down and

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,960
actually talk about some of the details

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,190
I think there will be even more overlap

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,980
and personally I'm not this isn't my

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,850
favorite baby where I say okay if this

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,910
baby dies then I'm totally unhappy it's

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,890
i want i want the networking

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,900
configuration to work well and I just

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,270
outlined what that means for me and if I

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,760
think we strike an agreement here then

00:18:52,270 --> 00:19:02,350
I'm I'm fine with that as well I don't

00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:04,270
need that to prove my my worth so for me

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,520
it will maybe take a little bit longer

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,220
because I actually wanted to ask the

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,350
same question here it's the first time

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,620
we see each other and it's the first I

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,710
we really don't do each other yeah I've

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,990
seen some exchange of emails between you

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,060
and Dan Williams which is our unofficial

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:27,400
project leader

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:30,580
i must admit i like your project but as

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,060
i see it you are talking about lots of

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:39,190
stuff you will implement and we already

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:43,060
have it so yeah lots of it what's of it

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:46,690
and lots of stuff that is actually not

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:50,470
not complicated in itself but becomes a

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,810
burden for example this is the if a

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,490
brown compatibility currently with

00:19:52,810 --> 00:20:00,010
network manager we did one thing we

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:03,250
selected out all bug reports about FF

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,770
down and gave them one single group that

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,370
we don't look at and leave it up to the

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:11,740
debian people to submit batches because

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,500
we really don't have time to cope with

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:18,630
other distributions I don't know if you

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:21,400
do but it's it's quite a lot of work

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,520
every change every new feature ever

00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,450
change in our configuration must be also

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:32,680
done in in a fab down plugin yeah that's

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,660
that's quite a lot none of us will do

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,000
this because we really don't have time

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,850
for that so we're just waiting for

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,010
further batches I don't know what what's

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,590
your opinion on this and and how you

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,920
plan to do this I don't know how many

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:52,660
people work on wicked we have four

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:55,180
people so yeah yeah and we feel that

00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,280
that these four people have quite quite

00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:02,590
a lot of work actually um to be a little

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,440
bit more positive we were talking with

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,990
Thomas graph which is kernel developer

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,200
and the panel author are using clip

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:14,110
panel or not yes yes you are we are

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,900
talking about the platform interaction

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,480
you are talking about virtualization and

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:24,340
projects that need to work also on other

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,890
platforms like even windows and we are

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,260
talking about a possibility to create a

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,480
library for for this that would be

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,650
cross-platform and network manager would

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,190
be one of the users for it this could

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,100
work for both of us just think about it

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:44,560
and we can talk about it later there are

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,200
many other things in network manager

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,870
that I considered would be nice to move

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,760
out and just use a library so there are

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,100
many things we could actually share I

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,890
don't know if you're up to something

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,350
like that or not but it's it's a

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,450
possibility yeah there are lots of stuff

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,670
that I already already finished there

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:07,000
are lots of stuff that are that need

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,920
just some changes we might even talk

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,980
about configuration formats we might

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,080
even talk about the bus interfaces yes

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,090
sometimes it might be it might be nice

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,920
to have at least some of them in common

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:23,830
I don't know this is thisis maybe maybe

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,960
my addition to do the question and you

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:30,460
probably want direct or not yeah i mean

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,230
this is this is something we need to

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:38,320
talk about um i mean from my perspective

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,810
if network manager if we see network

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,890
manager moving in the direction we think

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:47,770
is the right one I'm totally happy to go

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,570
and contribute their I would like to see

00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,030
some of the layering that we have in

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,790
network manager because anything that's

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,560
non layered will not really work for a

00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,930
very long time and I mean we've been

00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,400
talking for if if up and if config

00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,760
scripts we're talking about a lifetime

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,010
of 15 years and I don't want to change

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,930
network manager again and rewrite it

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,970
again and again and again in three years

00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,650
and then three years after that so that

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,660
it needs to have the same life

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,730
expectancy and it needs to have some

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,310
sort of backward compatibility Nia I

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,990
believe the red hat enterprise customers

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,890
will ask for the very same things as

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:26,680
ours do so there there needs to be some

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,660
smooth migration so I'm just being told

00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:34,180
that we've got three minutes left so

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:35,740
Robert all right thank you well this

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,330
basically goes in the same direction

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,830
right I mean you look at it from a

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,740
distribution point of view it's easy

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,600
right distribution point of view is easy

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,630
we can implement wicket they can have

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,440
network manager we don't care opensuse

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:52,320
fedora whatever but the people that

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,529
are the people that sit on top is vs

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,110
that need to interface with the network

00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:01,289
right and we already have problems with

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:04,679
is BS of having different config file

00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:06,840
formats today right so now if this goes

00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:09,299
in two different directions as this

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,759
appears to be going that's going to be

00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:13,529
creating a big mess for you know the

00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,009
IBM's of the world and whatever else

00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:19,590
that have application that depend on

00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:21,629
network configuration they possibly set

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,019
up the network in appliances by

00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:26,490
themselves without and if they have to

00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,230
interface with different tools and

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,169
different enterprise distributions it's

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,419
going to be a big mess so my

00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,669
recommendation would be that you guys

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,309
better work it out and it better be one

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:42,149
one way to do it and not two different

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:48,590
ways because if we do both Enterprise

00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:54,570
distributions will suffer okay thank you

00:24:48,590 --> 00:25:00,659
um you're expecting an answer or okay

00:24:54,570 --> 00:25:02,549
because I don't have one Kasten okay I

00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,830
guess then you're the last guy to say

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:12,690
something what is the feedback from

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:17,610
people outside souza for that because

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:22,259
it's on on get a 12 oz of the host at

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:28,649
Gaetano's so it's not an open to the

00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:31,620
project so okay well we don't have too

00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:35,820
many reactions because we have only

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:39,360
started to you know do some marketing

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:42,450
for it recently we had a lively

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,309
conversation on the Fedora list some red

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,100
hat people actually mailed me and they

00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,230
said well they like the design a lot of

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,440
red had people mailed me and said they

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,659
prefer a network manager because and

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,470
that's about the extent of feedback that

00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,470
we have had so far

00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:04,440
actually the the problem in fedora and

00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:08,909
especially that is not about project

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:11,220
quality or something even if we decided

00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:15,149
that wicket is slightly better for us

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,759
for the future it would eat lots of our

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:19,950
resources because we would then need to

00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,590
run both of the projects because we just

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,840
can't afford to leave network manager so

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,090
the problem is that you will hear from

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,799
so many people that they will say they

00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:33,869
will they like it they might even die it

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,549
but then they'll they will usually go

00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:37,619
back to network manager because they

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,840
know we will have to support it anyway

00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:44,820
so that is a problem it's not about

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:49,830
software quality even if we really do

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:52,259
things in a worse way it doesn't mean

00:26:49,830 --> 00:27:04,289
that we can switch easily to another

00:26:52,259 --> 00:27:06,389
project so thank you for being here

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:10,289
thank you for joining the conversation

00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:12,570
with us Pavel thank you all for your

00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:16,259
time and your patience and enjoy the day

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,749
will be outside you can grab us and talk

00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,869
more about this stuff ok thank you very

00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:20,869
