A small selection of the nearly 200 apps for Nextcloud

Nextcloud is by far the easiest way to get a complete, 100% open source, fully self-hosted solution that can replace Office 365 or Google Apps. From file sync and collaborative document editing to chat & video calls, mail, calendar and password management, you can do almost anything with the apps on our expansive app store.

In this lightning talk I'll quickly present #nextcloud and what it can do for you! One example: create a document, share it with your team, discuss it in the comments, add it to a video chat session & edit it together during a call.
And did you know you can create a poll with Nextcloud?
That there's a Kanban app?
GPX tracker? Sensor logger? Radio player?
