Yes, distros can work together!

When you are looking on the distribution and how they package things, they do it in so much different way. Even between RPM-based distributions, there are different macro, different package names and so on. People inside distributions tend to just write something what suit their needs and start using it.

With Rust we've taken different approach: we've designed prototype in Fedora and then before officially using it, showed to other people (openSUSE, Mageia, Debian), asked for feedback, worked with them to suit their needs and only after that went and started using it in Fedora. It didn't work out fully with Debian because the ecosystem is too different, but even there we've made agreement on the filesystem paths and basic principles.
