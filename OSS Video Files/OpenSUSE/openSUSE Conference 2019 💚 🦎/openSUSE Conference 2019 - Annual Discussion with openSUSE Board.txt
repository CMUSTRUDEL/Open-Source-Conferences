right yeah thanks everybody for coming

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,040
this is the kind of fun part of um

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:19,050
hopefully everybody's be hanging in

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,689
front of the whole conference so the

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,899
regular annual sort of conference board

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,329
meeting last year we had a whole bunch

00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,369
of topics and we kind of rambled on

00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,570
about all of them for the better part of

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,480
an hour and then had questions at the

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,920
end this one is a little bit different

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,140
because have you've been kind of keeping

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,550
up with the mailing lists there's pretty

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,329
much only one topic that's on the board

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,829
mind at the moment this idea of a

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,969
foundation or some legal structure and

00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:51,870
we're gonna be talking about this now

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,359
and please if you have any thoughts

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,359
comments questions as we go along the

00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,499
microphone is at the end is always open

00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:02,820
and you know we can kind of just work

00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:03,899
our way through it as we go and acts and

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,700
I think we said you would start

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,950
explaining why with what we're thinking

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,070
and why we're doing this so over to you

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,100
now well thank you rich

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,439
yeah welcome everybody to the board

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,290
meeting to the question and answer

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,439
session ask the board as Richard already

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,460
mentioned we spent a lot of time this

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:30,360
year in investigating whether we need a

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,320
legal structure and if we need one what

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:38,130
would be the ideal one so to spend some

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,350
words upfront I mean we all know zoos

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,750
and openSUSE have common roots history

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,360
and value so we are basically sharing

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,990
the genetics and we're also sharing the

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,689
logo for the most part and I think this

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,430
is it's a great benefit a win-win

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,920
situation for both of us

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,689
which we definitely want to keep so

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,180
everything that we're doing here is not

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:05,149
to separate us from Zuza

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:10,640
it is to gain more flexibility for the

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:14,180
openSUSE community what we've noticed in

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,439
organizing the last

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,540
conferences but as well and in

00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,390
sponsoring other projects or receiving

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,560
money from sponsors it is an issue that

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:28,829
the openSUSE community has no legal

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,810
entity behind it and if there is a

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,480
company for example that wants to

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,730
sponsor us or we as a community sink

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,230
this project is beneficial and we want

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,189
to donate some money for it we just

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,849
can't do it at the moment just for legal

00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:48,480
and as well for tax reasons so the idea

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:52,260
is now let's put a legal structure in

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,669
behind of openSUSE I'm just gonna add a

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,349
little bit of extra context order from

00:02:53,669 --> 00:03:00,269
the suicide souza is you know keen and

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,099
always trying to help openSUSE in these

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,620
kind of things like taking sponsorship

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,590
like arranging hardware and you know

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,599
providing services but you know just

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,370
with the nature of the fact it is a

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,919
company you know when dealing with other

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,419
companies you know suddenly things like

00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,579
donations become way more complicated

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,739
because you know an external company

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,139
might not want to give suit or its gmbh

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,690
a huge chunk of money and dealing with

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,190
things like invoices and taxes you know

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,019
with the lack of an openSUSE legal

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,959
entity gets yeah it gets complicated

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,290
with that so it's not a case of Suzu

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,099
doesn't want to help with that but just

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:42,720
because of the nature of the

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:44,129
organization that it is it can't so yeah

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,109
I think the motivations we have already

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,599
mentioned partnering with our

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,090
organizations out of Sousa receiving

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,479
donations being able to give donations

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,889
as well to other projects and so also

00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,359
what Richard mentioned in case we need

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,879
some additional hardware some service or

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,129
something like that we could easily sign

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,019
a contract with another company to

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,349
provide us this service even if it's on

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,079
a on a free basis for us so that they

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,509
are charging their efforts and getting a

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,269
kind of a donation received from our end

00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:21,779
all this is currently not possible so we

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,900
have event investigated various options

00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,530
various legal options what could they be

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,730
first of all a so-called found

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:36,730
Asian in German additive tone this is a

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:39,550
model under different legal or local

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,990
legal legislations almost the right word

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,160
I don't know I'm not a lawyer that other

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,380
projects like for example the document

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,850
foundation was driving the development

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:54,940
of Libre Office have chosen a German one

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,340
is the so-called if how and eyeing it's

00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,340
Cardinal fine we've translated this now

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,260
with an association this is fairly

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:09,580
simple thing to set up you just need

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:13,900
seven people you pull a template from a

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:18,600
website from the the court website fill

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,250
it in go to court and get registered

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,830
another option could be an umbrella

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:27,280
organization so that means we are

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,320
joining organisation like what are they

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:37,060
called rich as SPF or something like

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:39,370
that umbrellas that exist

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,229
yeah help either help provide these kind

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,650
of services for open-source projects or

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:49,210
be like a home for them more legally

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,740
right yeah thanks so in that case the

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:55,270
umbrella organization would sign the

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,919
contracts and receive a fee from us for

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,700
example I don't know what that charging

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,550
10% of the donations or whatever and

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:05,350
option four we keep it as it is which is

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,680
of course not the intention that we're

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:15,640
having to make a very very long and

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,780
discussion short the proposal of the

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:24,570
board is the so called foundation

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:29,040
Tipton's model the reason for this is

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:32,530
the foundation based on its

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,160
set up on its rules is much much more

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:41,500
stable like the Eevee like the Angus

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:45,010
partner fine in the worst case just a

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,140
construction but not far from reality we

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,500
get a bunch of new members into the

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:53,190
Eevee and they're suddenly changing the

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,720
purpose of observe

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,740
providing a community and develop a

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:02,290
distribution to selling t-shirts or

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,960
whatever and yes if they has a if they

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:08,950
can get a qualified majority they can do

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,110
it and then use it as such is gone and

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,720
this is something that we strictly want

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,880
to avoid we want to get some legal

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,550
independence but we want to make sure

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,110
that the structure of openSUSE and the

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,290
purpose of is as a nonprofit

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,860
organization dealing with free software

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:29,560
keeps persistent and the ideal legal

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,030
form that we could found up to now is

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:37,300
the foundation and from the this user

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,220
side of things you know one of the one

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,080
of the unique problem unique aspects

00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,540
when like talking to Sousa about this is

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,550
of course like we said at the beginning

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,620
you know the key you know keeping that

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,080
closeness and that relationship is a key

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,460
part you know both from the sort of the

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
community and the board's motivations

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,020
but also from Souza's and looking at how

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,700
other projects have done this you know

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,250
there's lots of open source projects out

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,240
there that have an Eevee and you know

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,620
sometimes they have some of these

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,740
problems with influence sometimes they

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:10,750
don't but no one really has an open belt

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,180
a foundation or built-in Eevee in the

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,550
open source world in the circumstances

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,930
that we're doing this in a normally it's

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,010
a case of a project starting from the

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,530
ground up and they need some legal

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,150
entity just so they can exist or they're

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,780
forming their foundation or they're easy

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,550
in response to you know a nasty

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,229
situation with a Quebec previous

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,790
corporate sponsor and then and therefore

00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,500
the foundation is some lifeboat of

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,229
Independence to get away from you know

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,510
the nasty corporate entity the one of

00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,919
the things we have here is we want to

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,930
stay close with Susan Susan wants to

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,090
stay close with openSUSE

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,520
but we want the foundation for the

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:49,030
purposes we've been talking about how do

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,190
you how do you model that how do we you

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,070
know structure that so the foundation is

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,560
is solid and stable in its own right and

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,060
solid and stable you know with its

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,850
relationship with Susan basically can we

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,520
use this foundation approach to codify

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,930
into law the weird and wonderful and

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,790
unique relationship we have with Susan

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,860
and that's kind of where we're we're

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,540
investigating now kind of why we've

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,840
chosen this route compared to the others

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,120
where you know the yeah the the legal

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,100
framework might be looser and therefore

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,980
actually harder to kind of pin down the

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:27,370
key parts we want to keep so one of the

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,640
main benefits of a foundation over an

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,190
Evie for example is we can keep the way

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,320
the openSUSE board is founded we can

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,140
keep the way membership works the

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,560
organization of open SUSE as it exists

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,930
at the moment can basically stay as it

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,270
is and will continue to be as it is but

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,120
we now have a legal entity behind us to

00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,390
support that which is whereas if you go

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,020
for an e V there is rules about how the

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,600
board is made how the members have made

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,370
up and that's not necessarily what we're

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,070
doing at the moment which would be a big

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,260
change in terms of running both

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,630
organizations and evey as well as a

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,700
foundation they have similar taxation

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,760
and accounting rules so we are not

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,650
gaining a benefit from one or the other

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,170
in terms of set up the foundation is

00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,730
slightly more reward but we can also

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,830
take advantage there from the

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,710
experiences that for example the

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,570
document foundation has already made so

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,260
they have already been preparing the

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,480
ground with German and legal authorities

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,650
to set up a foundation for a free

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,770
software project so my proposal is

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:42,960
before we describe the potential next

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,960
steps what are your questions or remarks

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,800
anybody hunts

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,630
yeah much closer science and just to add

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,130
to this discussion I have as you're

00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,699
probably aware I've set up several

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:04,029
foundations and v's in the cultural

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:05,829
sector in the Netherlands and my

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,620
experience is also that if you indeed

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:10,930
have a very singular focus in mind you

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,959
want to do long term and especially also

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,050
in keeping contractual relationship with

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:19,269
upstream partners like Susan a

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:23,579
foundation is much more stable but you

00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:26,589
see in the cultural sector is that the

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,510
association model works for individual

00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:31,690
artists working together collaborating

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,810
on certain projects but you very rarely

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,329
see it for things like festival

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,490
organizations or whatnot so I'm

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,370
absolutely convinced for you that you've

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,430
chosen the right type of entity also

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,860
saying that if you look at associations

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,519
as they are covered in the like the

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,670
Drupal Association which is a governing

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,060
board for the Drupal community they are

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,089
not an association in the rights in the

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,260
legal sense they were Foundation and

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,180
because they're a foundation they can

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,779
actually organize the program receive

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,100
sponsorships and whatnot so just my two

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,079
cents I think you're doing the right

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,870
thing and on a personal note I'm very

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,170
happy to finally see this materialize

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:20,350
because I prize the sponsor opens to the

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,600
conference before in 2013 I've managed

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,139
to sponsor it don't ask me how it works

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,720
and then in 2015 I even eyes open to the

00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:33,430
conference also don't ask me how it

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,139
works but it's awesome to see you and

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,649
pushing this forward so compliments to

00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:41,910
the board now thanks Hans other

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:41,910
questions Anna

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,230
you have said that at the moment is not

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:50,060
possible that we donate money to other

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,620
organizations and that is not true I

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,300
mean we are a sponsoring at the moment

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,670
many many many organizations many

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,800
conferences and we are doing it at the

00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,930
moment with sucess money and we are

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,459
speaking about quite a lot of money and

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,680
then my question is in the moment we

00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,000
have the foundation we will you say

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
openSUSE we will be able to do these

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,320
donations I wonder with with money I

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,079
mean it's to say going to give us some

00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,490
or before pension system budget or how

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:19,779
is it going to happen what's happen with

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:23,839
rally support for example so I guess the

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:25,480
I guess the openSUSE being able to give

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,430
to other people we already do but

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,640
attention but that always goes through

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,950
Souza so this would give the board the

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,620
opportunity to go under these

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,220
exceptional circumstances we want to

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,149
give money to someone else where we have

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,620
without going through Suze which we

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:44,980
haven't done in the past but that's

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,180
probably of all the reasons we've given

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,149
that being able to give money to other

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:54,560
people is the far lesser reason than

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:57,170
being able to receive money so I'll

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,180
speaking with two hats on first as

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:07,430
current home Sousa treasurer we don't do

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:11,899
a huge amount of sponsorships of other

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:16,730
projects we regularly sponsored gnome

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:23,149
KDE we have an arrangement with fedora

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:25,550
where we sponsor each other but it's not

00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:27,649
if we want to sponsor a project we still

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,589
have to go through Sousa get the

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,600
approvals and there are times where we

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:37,730
would like to sponsor a project or a

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:41,600
community or an event etc that may be

00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,699
close to conflicting with Sousa for

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,350
whatever reason being a company with

00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:51,260
commercial requirements etc they have

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:54,130
much stricter sensibilities about some

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,390
of these things whereas as a community

00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:00,050
we are much more relaxed

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:03,410
about those concerns so that that's one

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,210
aspect yes we do do sponsorship but we

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,900
could be better with the sponsorship

00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:15,260
that we're doing my other hat on is as a

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:19,790
sponsor of yokes is a conference it's

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:22,970
really complicated to get the money to

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:27,650
sponsor the conference okay so I've got

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:30,080
budget I want to provide that budget to

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:34,100
observe for the conference it's really

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,560
complicated because if we just give it

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,750
directly to Souza it has to go through

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,730
Souza's accounting etcetera or whatnot

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:48,400
and then it could quite easily and has

00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:52,280
done longer in the past got lost in

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:57,530
somebody's call center etc we have an

00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,030
arrangement at the moment for some for

00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,390
the it's of openSUSE to be able to

00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:07,520
receive the money for us who can then do

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:09,950
something in return but that's not

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,380
necessarily the best way of handling

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:16,040
that money if we could provide that

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,250
money directly to the other project the

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,010
project can then go okay this part was

00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,250
very generous in their sponsorship

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,700
donation we only need to use X amount

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,160
for the conference we then have

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,340
additional sponsorship funding that we

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,340
can then procure either hardware or we

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:41,780
can put additional funds towards TSP etc

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,550
by doing the foundation etc it's

00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,460
actually beneficial for Souza from a

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:50,740
financial perspective being a non-profit

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:53,360
etc there are tax benefits obviously so

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,760
we're not saying that we don't want to

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,060
use as money and we don't want to lose

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,190
it to participate in any aspects of the

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,320
project we most certainly want them to

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,960
participate and it's not about

00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,940
independence

00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:15,670
this is more about less dependence and

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:19,210
somewhat more autonomy to make our own

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,980
decisions to do things but still being

00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,980
able to keep that connection close I

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,980
understand that it is it will be easy to

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,540
operate but it's still any of what you

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,340
say answer my question what is the money

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,200
coming from because if we have no money

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,610
then we cannot donate anything so I mean

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,250
have we already spoken something with

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,290
Sousa will they give us some money I

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,570
mean nothing is set in stone with any of

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,830
this because you know it needs the

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,590
agreement of the community it needs the

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,120
agreement of Sousa you know so you know

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,620
we're at the we're at the stage now

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
where we can talk about this and we've

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,050
had discussions with Sousa kind of at

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,690
this level the general ideas are the

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,420
longer lines of at least some of the

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,790
budget the Sousa currently has for

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,250
sponsoring openSUSE and the other stuff

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:09,250
you know around that would almost

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,640
certainly be you know a regular donation

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:14,590
to this foundation we don't have the

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,400
numbers you know that's to be discussed

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,770
that negotiating didn't figured out and

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,230
given this model of doing everything

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,780
we're currently doing plus the new stuff

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,460
we don't necessarily need the numbers in

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,120
the sense of you know we do okay now we

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,580
do sponsor stuff we make it work somehow

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,550
so even if the foundation starts you

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,230
know with pretty much zero you know we

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,700
learn our lessons that way we develop it

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,530
over time you know and then you know

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Seussical end up funny about this now we

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,590
can stop worrying about all the

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,870
conference nonsense and make it the

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,190
Foundation's problem so you know the

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,560
nice thing with this emoto's we can kind

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,470
of organically grow it as we figure out

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,950
how it works from from all sides

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,660
sorry so I'm kind of excited to see how

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,890
this is going to play out but there's a

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,280
there's a couple of things that are a

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,510
little unclear about so the first one is

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,820
currently today with like for example

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,560
the openSUSE build service there is this

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,660
list at the top right corner of all the

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,940
sponsors and stuff I don't know exactly

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,830
how that kind of arrangement thing is

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,640
going but like have you guys thought

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,190
about like how we could

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,960
either a make that a process that is a

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,260
little bit more clear or obvious or like

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,549
how to how to preserve that relationship

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,790
because from what I understand Souza

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:34,600
provides the overwhelming majority of of

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,799
those resources there and how would we

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,170
make sure that we don't accidentally get

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,390
into a situation where we're suddenly

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,160
starved of all the things and you know

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,080
that's the those are the kinds of

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,970
unpleasant things that nobody likes to

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,330
think about but it's like you don't want

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:55,790
to be put into that situation and yeah

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:57,260
so okay I'll take it yeah with that kind

00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,640
of thing of a sort of the concerns of

00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,960
you know stuff that Susan's currently

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,549
providing like the billed service you

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,400
know is this gonna scare them away and

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,960
whatever this is you know we've already

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,150
started these discussions we have we we

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,380
had Thomas a Giacomo here on the first

00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,750
day of the conference you know he came

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,460
out with the dinner with the board for a

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,230
dinner the night before the conference

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,179
we basically gave him this presentation

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,490
we basically had this discussion you

00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,260
know from hit from suicide you know

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,419
Susie is committed to kick you know

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,640
keeping openSUSE on this footing it is

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:28,360
right now and helping it to expand so

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,040
you know these discussions are not

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,250
scaring anybody it's who's a you know

00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,480
and you know it's we're gonna that's why

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,080
we're doing them this way to make sure

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,059
that doesn't happen

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:44,000
him and with regards to the build

00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:46,910
service as somebody that has arranged

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,770
donations to the build service

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,000
it's complicated having to go through

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,620
the corporate structures that settle

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,710
because the legalese and and all that

00:20:51,620 --> 00:21:00,470
sort of stuff having an independent

00:20:53,710 --> 00:21:02,179
having a less dependent entity makes

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:06,490
things much much easier and we can

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:11,000
actually grow that sponsorship there are

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:14,110
companies and willing sponsors who want

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,179
to sponsor the project but refused to

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,790
deal with going through a corporate

00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:23,390
entity because they don't not that they

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,549
don't trust Sousa they just want to make

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:28,309
sure that one hundred and ten percent of

00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,400
that goes to the intended recipient

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,200
which is openSUSE

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,850
yeah and for example we have one one

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,410
sponsor carbon book exactly which one

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,580
you know where that was the case so you

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,929
you know you had all the usual

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,549
negotiations about sponsorship and

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:42,559
hardware transfer and then because they

00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,570
wanted to be absolutely sure that that

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,160
hard was being used by openSUSE you know

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,510
additional contracts had to be signed up

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,820
of in at least this hardware is being

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,620
transferred to SUSE Linux GmbH for the

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,820
sole purposes of being used by openSUSE

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,620
it's that gets complicated after were

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,420
you know this this really hope hopefully

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,220
knock some of that stuff down so that

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,490
stuff becomes easier for all of us on

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:08,299
suicide and on openSUSE side next

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,190
question yeah first of all I think this

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:12,730
is a good idea because I was asking for

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:16,309
it to last three years already

00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:19,610
you can help anytime yeah the thing is

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,530
that actually I guess I don't worry a

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,350
lot about money and about not about the

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,429
donations engi because these unleash a

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,690
lot of potential I guess the only thing

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,120
I've worried about or the only thing I

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,820
will ask about is what will be the

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,040
actually continuity in working thing so

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,850
how will the bots be set up in future

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,280
will there be some legal thing of the

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,290
foundation or not like will there be

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,390
some written thing how the bots will be

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,309
set up is there already a draft or not

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,020
if we can read what will be the role of

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,080
the chairman in this will just be still

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,460
elected by zoos or not will we all

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,660
become members of the openSUSE

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,250
foundation or not are there rules

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,860
ar-ar-ar and so on this is an important

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,640
thing for me yeah you can trust me there

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,309
will not be only one page of britain

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,730
like that at the moment if you look at

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:17,090
the wiki page for openSUSE there is the

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,040
existing rules that we define how the

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,309
board is elected there is the existing

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,630
rules for how members or who can be a

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:28,549
member that richard needs to put back

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:30,320
there but basically the idea is without

00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,450
having gone through a lawyer yet

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,010
fundamentally we don't want that

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,919
structure to change the chairman will

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:42,410
still be appointed by Sousa

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:44,030
the know the or the board will still be

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,600
voted by the members in the same way it

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:50,960
is now those rules have a current clause

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,809
that we can have a vote and half the

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,220
members can change those rules so if it

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,900
comes to a point in the future where we

00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,190
think that should be the members think

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,110
that should be changed they'll be free

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,790
to vote on that and change that

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,550
structure but we're not planning on

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,440
changing that in a drastic way and to

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,870
give you an idea about the next steps

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,740
that we currently foresee probably not

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:16,669
complete first of all this discussion

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,970
will start it again or continued on the

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,400
opens was a project mailing list at a

00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,240
certain point in time then we will have

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,270
a vote of the members whether they agree

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,179
to go to a foundation structure and then

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,040
if we have a qualified majority then we

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,000
will kick off the next step that means

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:41,570
for example that we sit together with

00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,850
lawyers with experts to discuss how the

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,370
charter of the foundation should look

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,630
like and this charter will be phrased in

00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:52,010
that way that the opposition as NGO for

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,840
free software will be more or less

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:59,450
carved in stone as Simon already said we

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,179
will try to keep the rest as it is and

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,570
as soon as we then have the foundation

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:09,500
set up the current members of the

00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:12,470
openSUSE project can opt in to go into

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,720
this foundation for legal reasons we

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,490
cannot force you to go over there but

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,320
you receive a mail and says yeah I want

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,300
to go for the openSUSE foundation and

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,980
then your membership is transferred one

00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,980
by one into the open source foundation

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:31,909
and to that on the mailing list you know

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,980
I'll be talking as souza you know about

00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:35,780
you know getting their support for you

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,929
know helping you know some logistical

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,030
things like you know a signing budget to

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,890
help us for example maybe fund a lawyer

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,270
so we have no legal advice for this you

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,770
know separate from Souza's lawyers so

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,660
you know there's no conflict of interest

00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,310
there

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,840
you know after the Charter of course

00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,580
almost certainly will have a second

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,140
membership vote of actually accepting

00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,660
the Charter so you know the community's

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,420
gonna be so yeah

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,940
deciding that the absolute fate on this

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:05,300
yeah but that's that's the coven where

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,330
we are today next question

00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,980
so you've explained why why are

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,740
foundation rather than an e V and that

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,140
all makes total sense what about an

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:20,030
umbrella organization like L air for SPI

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:22,640
is that any say for the vast majority of

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:26,180
them we are too big and we'll create too

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,620
much work so they don't want to they all

00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:32,300
charge around a 10% fee and so we can

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,940
probably the amount of money coming

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,090
through we would instead be able to use

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,920
that money to fund someone or ask Susan

00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,590
nicely to fund someone to do the

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,360
management for us so the board doesn't

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,990
expect to have to sit down and run the

00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,870
foundation doing all the explicit work

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,440
and to kind of give a personal ad on I

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,850
mean I I was personally quite fond of

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,970
even with those things you're quite fond

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,530
of looking at like SPI because that's

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:06,220
what a Debian are using for example for

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:08,450
an arch for their an SPI is a 503 C

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,250
charity in the States and in Europe

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,900
because of course we're making up lots

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,260
of us have in Europe there they have a

00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,300
chapter a friendly association of ffii

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,920
dot Evie who basically do the same

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,560
things take money Sam yeah and they work

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,510
together looking at this recently we've

00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,860
suddenly realized like spi and ffii

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,340
aren't really talking to each other

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,500
anymore

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,570
and that kind of thing makes you realize

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,060
ok you know yeah you know jumping from a

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,680
situation of a good working relationship

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,480
with with wanted to then being like

00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,470
totally dependent on another which you

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,930
don't have as good a relationship

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,430
overseas it like let's kind of push this

00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,200
a little bit towards the foundation idea

00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,150
ok we we can speak and build something

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,860
here that this rock-solid on like every

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:51,530
side of the aspect some I also applaud

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,990
this decision I think foundation is a

00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,220
good way to go or where there is some

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,730
some caveat and

00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,160
I was on a board of a organization which

00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,260
used to be a foundation a lot smaller

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,220
than openSUSE of course that was the

00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,740
xorg foundation which event eventually

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:16,650
ended up under the emperor umbrella of

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:19,110
SPI for a very simple reason the board

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,120
was constantly struggling because we

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,670
didn't have access to legal counsel

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,360
because unless we of course paid a

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:29,010
lawyer we didn't have access to to

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,720
accounting so it was always a struggle

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:36,090
to file taxes international money

00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,100
transfer was really difficult we didn't

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,460
sometimes we didn't know how to do this

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,980
and all of these things got resolved but

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,040
going under an umbrella because they had

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,500
all these services and you how to do all

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,410
these things so maybe this is not an

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,470
issue here and I certainly think that

00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:59,490
it's a better solution than an umbrella

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,890
as well so one of the conditions that

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,410
the board has put fairly firmly on going

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,100
forward in this way is to partner with

00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,150
Sousa for them to provide us with

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,400
someone who can help us do the

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,990
accounting side do the legal side we

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,150
haven't obviously looked at the

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,610
specifics of what that will look like

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,370
yet but one of the key points is we

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,070
would like someone we would like either

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,810
Sousa to fund

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:31,100
openSUSE to the level that openSUSE can

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:33,600
do you employ someone to do that or

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,270
suzer employ someone on open caesars

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,920
behalf to take care of those things so

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,690
that it is not something that the

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,450
project has to worry about Sousa has

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,610
quite a commitment to providing openSUSE

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,410
with everything they need they haven't

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,440
changed that commitment that commitment

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,180
still ongoing and as we've discussed

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,040
this with Sousa we've seen this is just

00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,830
an extent that sort of role is an

00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,970
extension of that commitment to provide

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:02,720
openSUSE with something with everything

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:06,540
it needs you have a question that's

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,710
logistic of the money is understandable

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,990
but what of all the people I mean

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:15,970
the people that's working on supporting

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:18,130
the project etc is there in case that's

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,840
openSUSE then we'll start to hire the

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,120
people to work on their priorities

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,279
because they think that this or that

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,029
project should go this way and so they

00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:32,100
think differently will be there some

00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:41,799
separation in this manner a lot um

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:44,559
that's a good question so there's an

00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,450
example of where openSUSE has gone in a

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,840
different direction to where Sue's is

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:53,010
going and that's cubic okay so you've

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,010
got cast from Sousa

00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:59,700
Oakes's a went down the cubic group a

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:06,460
Sousa went down the caste brute and

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:09,789
they're quite divergent and that's a

00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,419
healthy competition if you will

00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:15,580
you know it's just like if you know your

00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:19,710
two siblings two brothers two sisters

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:22,510
whatever there's always an element of

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,200
competition trying to be better than the

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:29,309
other one but at the end of the day

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,870
you're still part of a family and you

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:34,649
come to an agreement ultimate at the end

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:43,390
of the day in one shape or another I

00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:45,690
think for me this approach isn't as I

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,539
mentioned it's not about independence

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:52,659
it's about enhancing the existing

00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:55,270
relationship giving us a little bit more

00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:57,789
flexibility as an example in the past

00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,610
when the document foundation was founded

00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:03,100
Sousa were a founding member but due to

00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:09,820
commercial requirements and reasons they

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:12,549
had to withdraw their seat now we wanted

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:17,049
to ensure that we kept that relationship

00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:21,220
the TDF because it's close to everyone's

00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:21,770
hearts etc so we had to work on and

00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,830
getting

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:29,080
somebody from the um Sousa community to

00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:34,400
stand in and replace the scissor seat

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:36,950
that's an example of where we have

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,730
different views but we actually work

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,110
together well and so even though we're

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,570
doing something differently to what

00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:47,510
Sue's is doing it actually benefits both

00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,100
of us and so I think it's not something

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:53,360
that the board has actively discussed

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:56,300
being able to employ people to do

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,620
certain things with if we ever got to

00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,140
the position where we had enough money

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,610
they and a future board wanted to look

00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,920
at it I think it's important that the

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,470
structure we set up will therefore allow

00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,120
that and that's and that's actually

00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,550
another reason why some of the umbrella

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,920
organizations don't work because they

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,270
make it very hard to employ people

00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,230
Burroughs others but putting my Sousa

00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:22,070
chairman hat on now you know one of the

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:23,300
one of the first concerns being raised

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,130
by senior management Souter as we

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,870
discussed this is you know you know this

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,150
all sounds really good you know but you

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,930
know the Sousa wants to make sure that

00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:32,090
whatever

00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,770
openSUSE creates there you know it's

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,120
always going to be open for open for

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,110
Sousa to be able to contribute to and

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,730
that's either that's going to be one of

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,740
the things that we know we've already

00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,910
agreed we all want that so you know we

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,260
don't necessarily know how we're going

00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:44,060
to reflect that into the charter of the

00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,890
foundation but that's definitely

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,270
something that we aim to have reflected

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,430
in the Charter foundation so you know

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,190
whatever happens you know the openSUSE

00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:54,680
project is always there for Sousa to

00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,180
contribute to and be part of and you

00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,230
know there will always be a healthy

00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,230
working relationship with that

00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:08,110
I would like to ask about what firm is

00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:11,110
the most important aspect of the

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,750
foundation that I haven't here yet what

00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,970
happened with transparency is going

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,460
openSUSE to make public what we are

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,500
spending the money on if we have a

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,230
foundation and when I make when I say

00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,889
make public I mean publishing who we are

00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:36,399
giving money to the amount the date so

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:40,600
completely public without having the

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,730
legal advice what I would say is that

00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,010
the intention certainly is to be

00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:50,620
completely transparent there may be

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:56,100
areas where some funding or some line

00:34:50,620 --> 00:35:00,250
items can't be reported for legal issues

00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:06,790
but as an example we could show what's

00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:10,960
being spent on staffing you know so if

00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:13,240
we have to employ a secretary or

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,250
something like that for those things

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,330
then yes that would be shown on the

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:21,790
accounting we can show like I say this

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,370
is all without legal verification I

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,290
don't see an issue with showing how much

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,580
is being spent on TSP how much is being

00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:34,390
spent on sponsorships but it's still

00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:35,410
needing to be discussed and verified but

00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm going to give my personal view

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:40,210
anyway the what are the things I'm

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,770
really excited with this is the ability

00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,540
to make a lot of this stuff which which

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,570
we just can't make transparent now way

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,190
more transparent if you look at the

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:50,800
examples out there with things like a to

00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,390
ee-vie do it which is kind of somewhat

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,120
narrow you know you see the big bins of

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,710
what KDE EVs spending but not more

00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
compared to like the PDF whether it's

00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,100
it's you know a little bit more

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,720
extensive you know I would personally

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,690
want to sleep to more sort of the tea

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,570
DFS example of really pushing the

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:11,290
transparency as as far as we can liquefy

00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,730
at legal advice permitted yes so not

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:17,270
exactly zero size here but

00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:21,190
in the Netherlands we have a special tax

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:27,550
exemption status for foundations it's a

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:30,770
foundation for doing let's say use

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,930
useful project in communities and they

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:37,040
have very clear rules and regulations

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,930
about what you must report on in in your

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,330
annual plateaus and that's pretty much

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,290
as transparent as you can get it so if

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,320
the foundation

00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:49,130
openSUSE is aspiring for once to have

00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:51,770
that kind of tax breaks then you also

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:54,230
matter they end up being quite

00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,720
transparent in basically anything there

00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,890
are certain areas in the Netherlands in

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,170
which you can avoid having select name

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:06,650
sponsors by name if a sponsor doesn't

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:09,140
want that but then you have to address

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,580
this to the Tax Service directly then

00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,320
you don't have to publish the name of

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,350
the sponsor in your annual reports but

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,280
you have to inform the tax authorities

00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,290
on that procedure so it by definition

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,810
this will be much more transparent than

00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:26,840
it ever can be when integrated in a

00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:28,190
company and those rules for that so of

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,540
course I was not speaking about the

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,210
things that are illegal I mean if you

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,430
cannot probably something you cannot but

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,050
for example policies so saying how much

00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,550
money you are spending conference I mean

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,440
that you tell me you have spent 10,000

00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,770
euros in conferences send me absolutely

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,450
nothing and I don't see I don't think it

00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,710
will be illegal to say what conference

00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,350
and how much amount of money we are

00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,880
giving every conference we spend so I

00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,070
think that is the kind of transparency I

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,290
was speaking about I mean of course you

00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,970
employ a secretary I don't want that you

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,820
tell me the name I don't need that but

00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:01,750
that we are spending that moment of

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,750
money on personal

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:10,010
let me show the example of TDF

00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:12,200
all the ledgers are published obviously

00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:15,770
there are some numbers that are

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,620
aggregated because you can show how much

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:20,780
you are paying a particular employer for

00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,630
example but everything is it's available

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,130
you can go on the website on the

00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,170
foundation

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,380
some of the website and you can download

00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:33,950
the the lectures and then you can see

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,970
how much is spent for the conference for

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:39,980
the annual conference

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:43,700
how many donations are the foundation is

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,920
receiving so you can obviously see

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,950
everything and if you have time you can

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,069
also do the maths and at the end

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:54,890
understand where they where the money

00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:58,160
are going in any case if you don't want

00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:00,980
to deal with with the spreadsheet or if

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,410
you are not an expert in budget and it's

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,500
not something really immediate to

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:10,130
understand and to read for example TDF

00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:13,190
is producing an annual report with all

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:15,589
the details about the activities done by

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:18,950
the community and there is also the

00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:22,789
financial part describing that describes

00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:25,549
how the donations are spent which are

00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:28,309
the plans for the next year so you can

00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:31,940
have everything obviously we need to

00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:34,579
discuss the details for the openSUSE

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:39,109
foundation but the document foundation

00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:41,269
is a foundation that is a German one in

00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:44,089
Berlin so probably it will be something

00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:46,009
similar but it is possible to do I'm

00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:47,420
pretty sure so my question is is going

00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,039
open suited to go in this direction you

00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,500
know try to make public everything that

00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:54,799
is possible yeah absolutely this one is

00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:58,730
the idea obviously I'm not illegal but

00:39:54,799 --> 00:40:01,099
I'm the chairperson for TDS hi so the

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:04,789
details on that side of the foundation

00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:08,089
and I I can answer that it's possible so

00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:13,250
why not to go on this direction this one

00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:17,119
is the idea related bit of experience I

00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:19,369
guess I've been involved in running

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,029
running Linux conf are you in Australia

00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:24,529
one year and that's put on by Linux

00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:27,920
Australia which is an incorporated

00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:29,539
association in Australia which tries to

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,890
be as transparent as possible about all

00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:35,809
things and so la will publish figures

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,180
for how much it spends when it runs

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,799
conferences it gives community

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,690
two people that will say how much we're

00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:44,270
spending on grants and things and it

00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,349
will be as transparent as it can be

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,140
about all those things so all of that

00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:51,260
gets released somehow but where it gets

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:54,440
tricky is money received as sponsorship

00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,770
for conferences that it runs because if

00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,329
you've got say red hat and Sousa and the

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,970
bun to all sponsoring the same

00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:05,630
conference and all appearing at the same

00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:07,339
level of sponsor they may actually have

00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,109
paid slightly different amounts of money

00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,029
each depending on exactly what they

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:13,760
negotiated with who was running sponsor

00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:17,029
liaison and so the organization can't

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,730
say individually how much each sponsor

00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:22,970
of a given level contributed or we would

00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,920
piss off our sponsors but we can say as

00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,990
a whole how much was received so I don't

00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,170
know that's sort of an example of the

00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:32,260
sort of tricky things you can have with

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:34,220
wanting complete transparency but not

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:40,789
you know being able to get as close as

00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:51,529
you can if you like next question from

00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:54,400
anybody comments feedback no yes okay so

00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:54,400
what do we have next

00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:03,740
one thing I would like to find out is

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:08,450
that we as a board are presenting this

00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:10,640
idea but we need all of you I've been

00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:13,069
around for 15 years in the sousa and

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,680
open source communities and I've seen

00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:18,950
this discussion before and not just a

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:23,420
single time and the last times it didn't

00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:26,990
work because was mainly because we as a

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:31,220
community did not step up and do things

00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:34,430
it can't be done by the board on its own

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:39,559
we need your input we need your feedback

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:42,400
so please help out if this community is

00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:42,400
dear to yard

00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:54,859
yep and yeah that's it thank you very

00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:57,170
much some one last thing into part

00:42:54,859 --> 00:43:00,020
meeting so I had a bet with the part

00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,030
like do you manage to send out all the

00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,309
meeting minutes until the conference if

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,140
I would have managed that then yesterday

00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:07,849
you would have seen we will retrieve

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:11,000
head so that you have something to laugh

00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:13,640
about me and then I thought let's turn

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,650
that bit around and we have exactly one

00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,190
person who has to send out minutes for

00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:28,099
match

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:37,849
