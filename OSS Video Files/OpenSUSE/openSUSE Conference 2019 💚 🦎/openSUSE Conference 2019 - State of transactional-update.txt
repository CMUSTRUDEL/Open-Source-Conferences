News & file system layout anatomy

You may have heard about transactional updates already - that thing that will force you to reboot your system just like on Windows. Well, it still does, but it also provides a huge benefit compared to your regular updates: It won't break your currently running system.

transactional-update is the default update mechanism on openSUSE Kubic and when using the "Transactional Server" role in openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed. This talk is intended for both existing users and newcomers and will feature the following contents:

- Give an overview of the design
- Highlight the most important changes since last year, including the all-new _/etc_ handling
- Give a general overview of the file system layout
