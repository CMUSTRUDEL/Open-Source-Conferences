Keystone is the OpenStack component responsible for identity management and
user authentication and authorization, which has unique challenges in
cloud-like environments where secure sharing of resources is an essential
requirement and yet is fundamental to the core idea of collaborative
computing. This introductory talk will give an overview of the keystone
project, including:

* The many ways users and applications can securely authenticate with
  keystone, including SAML2.0, OpenID Connect, X.509 and Kerberos
* The implications for authorization in a multitenant environment and how
  role-based access control is designed in keystone
* How keystone relates to projects outside of the OpenStack ecosystem such as
  Kubernetes
