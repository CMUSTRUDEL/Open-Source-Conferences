A new distro for a new age

As the world moves more and more towards containerised solutions, a number of real questions start to appear. - What is the perfect platform for running containers atop? - How to use this platform as part of a flexible, scalable, highly available infrastructure fabric? - How to minimize the maintenance and administration of this platform at scale? 

Many of these problems are well answered in enterprise container offerings, but for developers more interested in the state of containers & kubernetes upstream, new issues start to appear. With such fast moving upstreams, developers and enthusiasts need a platform that can keep up and is closely involved with those upstream developments. This platform needs to not only be able to run containers at scale, but also on single machine, all the while preserving the attributes of low maintenance so the focus can be on the containers, not the base system beneath them. 

And then the question becomes "What is so special about containers anyway?" - in more and more cases, people are deploying Linux VMs, Cloud instances, or bare metal to do 'just one job', with other jobs being handled by other machines. Can we simplify the Operating System and make it easier to live with if we optimise it for these 'single-purpose' deployments?

This talk introduces openSUSE MicroOS, and explains how it addresses the above, being the perfect distribution for this modern age. The session will explore in some detail how MicroOS is developed in lockstep with the Tumbleweed rolling release and can be used for a wide variety of single-purpose systems.

This talk will also discuss openSUSE Kubic, the MicroOS variant focused on containers. The talk will share how Kubic collaborates with various upstreams including kubeadm and CRI-O. Transactional Updates, Kubic's system update stack will be demonstrated and the benefits from such an atomic update approach discussed in some detail.

Finally the kubictl Kubernetes cluster boostrapping tool will be discussed and some future plans shared for consideration and feedback.
