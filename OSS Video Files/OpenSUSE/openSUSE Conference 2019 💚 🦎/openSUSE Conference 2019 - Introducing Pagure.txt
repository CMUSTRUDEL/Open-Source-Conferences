A new lightweight and powerful Git-centered forge, now in openSUSE!

Pagure is a new, full-featured Git repository service for the web, written in Python. It is similar to other popular Git-based forges, allowing developers and contributors to share and collaborate on code and content. It also has some unique features not found in any other Git forge providing the basis for decentralized, federated software code hosting and development.

It's fully free and open source software, and it's included in openSUSE Leap 15.1 and openSUSE Tumbleweed!

The agenda of the presentation:
- What is Pagure
- History of Pagure
- Current state and features of Pagure
- Current ecosystem around Pagure
- Plans for the future of Pagure
- Demo of Pagure on openSUSE
