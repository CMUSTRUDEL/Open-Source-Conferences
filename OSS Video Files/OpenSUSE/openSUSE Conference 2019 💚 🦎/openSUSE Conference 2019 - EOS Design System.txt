The solution to bring good UX to all OSS

In the past UX design was a commodity in the paid consumer world, where companies like Facebook, Google, Uber would invest millions on. Today the gap is closing. Enterprise and Open Source applications are in need of better UX too.

On the other hand, many companies of all different sizes struggle with today's IT agendas: bleeding edge software, agile development, short time-to-market, etc., and this "new" (and really not so) kid on the block is not making it any easier for developers and designers to keep up: UX design. 
Companies struggling in this scenario will eventually suffer from a big level of inconsistency in their products portfolio, and sometimes even in one same product.

Design Systems can help solve this problem, and a few more. Design Systems serve as a centralized source of information for UX, UI, and other brand-related guidelines that help not only developers find the UI element or component they need, but also designers to build faster prototypes while streamlining the collaboration between the two.

But, building a Design System can take a very long time and be very expensive, this is why we're building EOS: an Open Source and customizable Design System. 
In this presentation, we will talk more about the problem Design Systems solve, how we are building EOS, and how it can be of great benefit to your company or project.

design system team I live in Barcelona I

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,039
was gonna make a joke about the weather

00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:16,289

designing under on developing a

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,969
component for the the design system that

00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:35,990
are ensure that products in at Susie and

00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:40,560
other open-source products have coherent

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,319
user experiences my name is Cynthia so I

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,009

years of Morris and I actually I started

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,799
with this project of creating a design

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,649
system for for sousei in Italy I'm

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,170
actually the product owner of the u.s.

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,090
design system I'm also a front-end

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,880
developer UX designer I do a lot of

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,569
things here and there and here I will

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,520
today actually we gonna start here today

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,130
we want to take you into a little a

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,160
little journey so you understand how we

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,270
are to be understood we found out

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,670
design systems are their solution to

00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:23,990
providing good experiences to our

00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,760
customers so software is hid in the

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:31,250
world that was a phrase I was published

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:34,970
in The Wall Street Journal in 2011 and

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,620
it was afraid that actually was making a

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,440
lot of noise out there because by that

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,860
time a lot of there are our industry had

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,050
to start to adapt and understand the

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,620
software was becoming a core part of our

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,570
lives

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,640
and today actually we cannot do a lot of

00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,000
things without software and actually

00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,560
this displaces reality with our software

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,750
we cannot really do our daily tests and

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,170
no even work at all and we can see that

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,970
one of the the things that happen when

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,840
this phrase was actually published you

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,740
know in The Wall Street Journal

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,020
blockbuster was actually kind of

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,730
collapsing by them and and Netflix was

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,280
eating blockbuster so the in the

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,020
industry was really being disruptive and

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,280
there actually happened there was

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,180
something else is happening right now

00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,030
and it's the design is hidden software

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,800
development at the same time that some

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,320
other other revolutions are happening

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,720
out there as well right so one can say

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,640
the virtual reality is also hidden so

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,500
for development no one can say that I've

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,760
made the reality is also eating software

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,620
development there's a lot of things are

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,020
disrupting the way that we do software

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,590
today but one attained and today we can

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:58,250
afford is certain design and why is this

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,050
it is because a lot of companies and the

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,690
industry actually realized and we

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,610
understood today that in order to make

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,750
better software we actually have to

00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,730
provide their better experiences and

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,030
design and UX experiences actually will

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,070
helps us to deliver good quality of

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,670
experiences of of products to our

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,100
consumers so we have a lot of companies

00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,800
in their consumer world actually

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,560
understood either

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,479
this that they started investing a lot

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,569
of money into creating with and better

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,849
experiences some of them I just

00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:37,180
mentioned a couple of Facebook over are

00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:40,289
being being so on and so far the

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:44,650
examples here's for example the way the

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:46,810
Facebook is one of the biggest content

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,430
managers or content databases in the

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,080
world that they actually don't create

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,909
anything they said see the consumers are

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,159
creating of creating little for for them

00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:57,250
and that's because software and the

00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:59,919
experiences they provide to us I love

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,400
them to gather all the information and

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:10,000
say happen same happens to everyone else

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:11,680
and this is another realities as well so

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,460
this is a generation this is a two years

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,669
old and this is a video that the father

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,490
made in which actually she's he's

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,590
showing the the kids train team zoom an

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:28,650
image this video I shall became very

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:32,949
very it was he was seeing everywhere and

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,259
everything is a we actually have to pick

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,900
up the pace a little bit with with this

00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:40,029
revolution with health we enhance

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,529
experiences and how we make our products

00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:46,750
better because today so visit there was

00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:48,279
a lot of different generations and every

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,529
generation is known for known for

00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,710
different things for example the

00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:57,400
Millennial self are known for the very

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,469
good of multitasking and we understood

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,050
our understand processes maybe in a

00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:04,870
different way that it was for the baby

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,370
boomers as the previous generation well

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,889
now this generation which is the

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,190
generation set is called they were

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,770
actually born with all the software that

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,460
we have today so there's a there's

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,650
another reality here and it's a when you

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,379
create software when you design software

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,240
design our products there's one

00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:28,259
essential thing that we have to look

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:33,750
into and there's a we have to fulfill

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:36,130
users expectations so the more that we

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,280
use software it's a more

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,140
we can use the certain patterns for

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,560
software name the more the wheel that we

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,400
expect to see those experiences from one

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,590
product let's say from Google Maps

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,230
Google Maps has a sort of way of showing

00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,630
us direction if you use another product

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,720
for taking directions to come to the

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:02,070
surface conference for example you kind

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,360
of expect the same patterns and

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,240
experiences that's because it actually

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,810
is wiring your brain is as I said these

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,400
psychic experiences these interfaces are

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,690
getting to you and like I said before

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,580
there's a new generation coming as well

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,390
that we actually should never forget the

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,210
new generations they disrupt our markets

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,740
they disrupt the way we do things and we

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,930
should pay close attention to this

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,050
generation that's coming and actually

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,910
it's not so far away from us because of

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,170
if we consider people that were born in

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:40,900
2000 1996

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:44,050
there.what night 21 years old more or

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,240
less and they're already among us and

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,550
they Ori are more experienced that we

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,910
are and I strew we have to understand

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:55,420
that the young people may know things

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,880
sometimes better than we do so we have

00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,990
to invest in our experience how you have

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,750
to improve the way we deliver

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:06,610
experiences to our customers but then ok

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:10,320
it's a maybe it's not so hard to

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,670
understand that we have to implement you

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,940
deliver good experiences call deliver

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,950
good UI in our applications but there is

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,650
there's another reality and this is

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:27,420
another reality that came straight into

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:27,420
your faces oh it's not plain

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:41,599
yeah so we got this face lab and hello

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,730
we we are in a very specific industry

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,010
open source and enterprise authority

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,970
works in a very different way to the

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,630
companies that I was showing before

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,850
Facebook / Google Airbnb anything

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,760
anything that is consumer oriented they

00:08:53,850 --> 00:09:00,029
they have some parallel priorities and

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,730
prerogatives that we don't have we don't

00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,470
have the time normally to deliver things

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,930
and we have to just ship it as soon as

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,120
we can so we don't lose customers we

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,579
have different customer bases as well we

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,779
have people that are more experienced

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:18,570
and sometimes what we make we tend to

00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,980
think that we don't have to deliver such

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,350
good experiences of such Keith

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,779
interfaces because they're experts and

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,910
they know what they're doing but that's

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,399
that's not really the reality today so

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,810
that was that's how it was a long time

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,269
ago

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,730
one GU say we say the enterprise and

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:39,720
open-source software was far far ahead

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,880
in terms of the user experience in

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,430
comparison to consumer consumer oriented

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,100
companies now do you think that gap is

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,390
closing and we have a lot of companies

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,579
out there that are investing a lot of

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,360
money that they have the money to hire

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:58,380
thousands of elf designers and uxx

00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,980
personal death but there is a there's

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,360
also a better way to do this and like I

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,740
was saying a lot of company have the

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,940
money and they have the budget to do to

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,290
hire people but actually scaling design

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,269
through hiring is not really the only

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,250
way to do you can also improve your

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:17,100
processes and this is why these

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,320
scientists are so hot right now like I

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,589
said here this Isis and I'm sure that

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,120
you're heard at some point the roller

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,839
companies are investing in design

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,839
systems so yeah we we are one of them

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,910
and what is a design system so design

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,060
system is a centralized source of

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,260
information but a lot of people tend to

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,990
think that because it has a were

00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,060
designing it it means that is 40

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,940
miners but that's not really true this a

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,220
design system helps developers and

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,430
designers and to be really very helps

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,630
more developers ten designers to provide

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,800
and deliver cohesive experiences so

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,260
that's the whole point of a design

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,630
system it has all the tools that you

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,490
need to provide an experience that is

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:07,260
consistent throughout all of your

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:12,149
product portfolio let's show you a

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:15,810
little a scenario of a company with deep

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,000
with free products in this case how they

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,610
work with us with without a design

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,080
system and with a design system so

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,240
basically this will be more or less the

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,459
setup of a company that has different

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,260
portfolios different color products you

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:31,310
will normally have a designer purple

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,720
product working with developers directly

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,290
but then as you see here so I just beat

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,209
a very basic example of a close button

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,620
there is actually what happens India

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:46,920
when you have groups of people will work

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:50,130
in isolated and in this way the outcome

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,980
tends to be this so the computer the

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,570
interface and the experience for your

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,070
consumers because you we obvious we

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,079
always have to think about the customer

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,570
and are considered consumer of the

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,570
application is different so we have this

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:07,860
rail the black and the blue button this

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:10,410
is just a silly example of course bottom

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,990
line is a weekend is growing in

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,350
consistency it's more expensive to test

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,240
because in this case we had to test we

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,709
had to test the first one for this

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
brother the second for the other

00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:25,110
products we are testing each sign the

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,380
same component for every post it

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,890
actually becomes expensive it's non

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,350
collaborative collaborative because we

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,420
have every designer is working isolated

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,089
in different ways so actually if you

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,970
actually try to fix that we really try

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,910
it it's a lot more complicated and it's

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,920
really frustrating for designers so you

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,449
have to try to align when you have

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
different use cases and different

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,790
products and you have different agendas

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,520
in different

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:57,360
that so that's what he was that's what

00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,190
you came and well something else I

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,480
actually I was almost forgetting to say

00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:07,530
he's a it's not really usable so that's

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,170
one of the main waste of money I would

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,510
say so the company is creating something

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,150
for one product like for example in

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,310
product the first one why didn't we just

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,200
use these in the other products well

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,450
maybe because the agendas were not a

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,140
saying maybe because the use cases were

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:27,990
noticing condos well with the design

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,740
system everything goes to the source

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:34,380
first and this is how we save money

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,330
somehow because Indian we are saving

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,010
development time we are saving testing

00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:44,580
time but we really need to focus the

00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:49,800
consumer has the same experience in all

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:52,020
of the products and like I said before

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,700
so this is also it streamlines the

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,530
collaboration between designers and

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,870
developers because everything goes to

00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,910
the source is not so much to discuss

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,340
really he has been tested as has been

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,470
discussed previously before he goes into

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:11,880
the product so yes it's a it's a lot of

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,980
money in time saved this structure of a

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,300
science system just so you have a rough

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:24,890
idea is composed of assets icons

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:28,830
typography components templates modules

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,730
guidelines how we talk to our consumers

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,470
how how how is our brand interpreted by

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,810
the consumer and like I was saying

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,310
before this is not for one or the other

00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,160
it's not just for designers not just for

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,590
developers for both it normally what we

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,490
get out of a design systems we get the

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,920
components that the developers need and

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,770
normally it's just a front-end part

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,630
backing is never included and we get all

00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,120
of these same pieces because designers

00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,790
also need to continue continue growing

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,380
there are their products and the design

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,140
system as well

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,920
but everything is in one place and

00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:11,460
everything is tested in just one place

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:15,090
and okay so now I shouldn't gotta give

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,720
it to my colleague so as Cynthia will

00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,040
explain the design system is a great way

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,540
of actually breaking away with these

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,630
silos where we can't really ensure that

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,720
there is coherence between different

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,610
teams in terms of UX and UI but it's

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:40,230
also true that developing a design

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:42,960
system how does this work no oops there

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:48,540
you go developing a design system takes

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:51,240
time and money it's there's a whole

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:54,540
process of research and development in

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,970
behind the design system initially the

00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,120
there's a step where components are

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,760
defined where we try to identify areas

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,830
of our interfaces where we need to

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:10,040
ensure that interaction with our users

00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:12,960
is meaningful and then of course once we

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,530
identify these these issues we want to

00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:20,340
solve with a design system there's a

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:24,660
whole side of research where feedback is

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:27,180
gathered where we speak to our you lose

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:33,180
our users where we look at analytical

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:35,970
data and you know we we define different

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,770
elements that will compose our design

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,910
system and that of course translates

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:45,900
into into money it's costly and it's

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:48,710
clear to us that many projects many open

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,760
source projects organizations small and

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,430
medium-sized businesses probably don't

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,530
have the the resources at a human and

00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:01,200
financial level to actually build their

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:03,299
own design system and this is why it's

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,390
not working

00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:08,949
okay sorry and then this of course the

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,390
whole issue with scalability let's say

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,750
you're building your own design system

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:18,159
you want to have a set of rules that

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:20,169
actually make sense for your interfaces

00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:22,870
and break away with these silos we

00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:25,120
mentioned before but then of course your

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:28,990
interfaces evolve new features are added

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:32,250
even you may pivot the whole purpose of

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,570
your project and that means revising

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,030
again your design system going through

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,190
them and making sure that it's you know

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,530
that you don't define components

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,850
redundantly that everything is reusable

00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:48,429
and that's something again that it's not

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:54,100
probably easy to assume by - who

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:55,240
actually am - I'm sorry and it's not

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,940
certain thing that necessary you know

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,640
you need resources for it to actually be

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,100
able to to handle and to maintain this

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,320
design system and probably many

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,289
organizations don't have these resources

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,650
so why did why do we why do we build use

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:17,200
what's the reasoning behind it we want

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,900
to build a design system that's

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,270
customizable which means that you know

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,799
you just can go on our repository you

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:30,570
can clone it fork it and easily apply

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,549
your brand to it your brand your project

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,230
colors whatever it's just very the ideas

00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:38,620
that it's easy to customize by anybody

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,809
we want it to be scalable we want we

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:45,970
want to be able to actually add features

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:49,360
to it easily and we of course want it to

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,890
be open source which is to us what makes

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,900
makes us different from other design

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:58,830
systems to our ideas to be the first

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:03,280
open source customizable design system

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:05,110
you know we we leverage we use open

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,080
source technologies on our daily basis I

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,150
think we all do and for us at the years

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,679
I think it's we think it's important

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,200
that we sort of give back to the

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,429
community and you know encourage

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,410
everybody to to actually collaborate and

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:23,380
and you know sort of help developing a

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,330
sort of open design system you know we

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,590
strongly belief in the idea that you

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,290
know you exist for everybody not just

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,330
big enterprises as Cynthia mentioned

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,730
before there are big enterprises who

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,130
have massive amounts of resources and

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:39,250
tons of designers and developers working

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,360
on a design system but that's that's you

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,670
know that's not the case for the

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,860
majority of us so you know we want good

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,040
UX for open-source you know any project

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,010
you may be working on you can just

00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,340
leverage the our design system

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,380
yes design system and we also we also

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,770
want to encourage you to go beyond the

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,960
framework what do we mean by this

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:05,170
usually if you build your web interface

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,300
you use technologies like well libraries

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,160
such as frameworks such as bootstrap for

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,490
example which already provides you with

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,730
a set of components and different UI

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:20,470
elements but what it doesn't give you is

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:22,240
really you know an understanding of how

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,850
do you use these components how do you

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,470
interact with your user what does work

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,740
what doesn't and how do you speak

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:31,750
communicate with your user and that's

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,120
that's what makes you know that's what

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,130
actually makes a design system different

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,800
what actually is the added value of a

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:44,350
design system I'm sorry sorry

00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,880
apologies and of course it you know as I

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,880
said before we want it to be open to

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:53,050
everybody we we think that you know

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,150
there's a lot to give and a lot to - a

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,700
lot of feedback to take from the

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,040
community and this is why we already

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,730
have contributors on on our project and

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,309
you know we take feedback from them and

00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,500
we sort of collaborate closely with them

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,750
and yeah that's great

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,020
so what have we done so far how far did

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,030
we get with this and we are at an early

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:20,650
stage of community of customization what

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:25,059
do I mean by this so our idea was to so

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:28,690
we use is the design system for Susan so

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,760
we we the main purpose of it initially

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,380
was to actually ensure that you know

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,880
there's coherence and consistency

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,710
between us products so Cynthia the

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,690
example she gave before you know if you

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,470
have different silos different teams

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,780
that develop a patent for example it

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,780
translates into different styles of

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,919
buttons for product in that actually are

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,740
from the same company so that's

00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,500
something that we we manage to do and

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,290
then we wanted to prove that this is

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:06,429
that yes is customizable and this is how

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:09,429
we actually also deployed the the

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:12,880
openSUSE design system so basically it's

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:16,780
a fork of ours of us but with the

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,820
branding of openSUSE and the proof of

00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,150
concept is there we prove that it's it

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,530
can be done you can just customize the

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:28,990
design system for your for your needs

00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,570
now the idea is to take this beyond

00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,200
proof of concept what we want to do is

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:40,840
we want to be able to customize it

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,820
completely which means adding a content

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,630
management system for example where you

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:49,179
know once you you you you start using us

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,290
as your design system you can easily add

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:56,470
new components to it and you know it's

00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:59,080
it also makes it accessible to two

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:02,890
designers and you know everybody who may

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:08,169
actually work with it and what does it

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:10,000
look like so as I said before this I'm

00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:13,470
gonna do a quick demo now I'm gonna show

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,960
you a couple of components but I

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,630
encourage you to also visit the the this

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,669
URL so this is the the ears design

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,830
system is let's say the main design

00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:28,350
system and then of course we also have

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,350
the openSUSE flavor of it yes

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:41,090
okay so I will just leave this here so

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:44,570
I'm gonna I'm gonna demo ears mainly

00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,780
because this is let's say so we work on

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,410
different features and we're gonna give

00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,330
you a few examples of how you know how

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,300
it works what what makes it different to

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,000
a framework like bootstrap for example

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,440
and I think a good example of this would

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,210
be for example alerts so basically you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,920
know many frameworks many UI frameworks

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,140
actually come with these components so

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,790
you have alerts defined how they look in

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:16,390
the States etc but what they don't do is

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:19,610
they don't tell you how to use them

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,740
where to use them and you sort of you

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:25,309
know be aware of the different contexts

00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,530
where you can use them and then ensure

00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,360
that they are meaningful to the user so

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,190
one example would be so there are

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,030
different alert types so there's a

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:38,420
global alert and a global alert is it's

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,860
something that will appear put the sort

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,059
of at the top of your application of

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:46,100
your web application and then basically

00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,720
what you see is there's a you know

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,090
always a short description of how to use

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,730
them and what kinds of actions they can

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,750
include whether they can be dismissible

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:59,809
or not things that actually do matter

00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:03,110
depending on the context of each case

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:07,220
scenario and then of course on you know

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:09,740
and what you see is that we've as I said

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,540
before we are actually using bootstrap

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,490
as a base so it's not like this is a

00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,510
this isn't a framework for you for you I

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:20,270
only so the idea is that using bootstrap

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:24,980
you can also sort of use this on top to

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:28,040
actually just simply copy the the

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,490
example and just add it straight to your

00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:36,290
application so that this is an example

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:41,059
so you see it as different so if you of

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:42,710
course something I just forgot and these

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,290
are code examples but then at the same

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,810
time there's also specifications for

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:53,660
I mean the idea is that this is used not

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:55,130
only by em by designers but also but not

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,320
only by developers sorry but also by

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,330
designers so in the end you have a full

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,800
set of specifications you know the

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,800
information you need to actually be able

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,500
to implement your these elements in your

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,130
interface I'm just gonna give you

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,200
another example yeah but it's not all

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,880
about you know design it's also about

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,360
things like how we communicate with our

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,010
users and so for example we have writing

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,700
lights so what what are these writing

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,770
light so you know there's there's when

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,080
you have an interface that actually

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,050
speaks to the user let's say you have an

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,790
error in a in a pop-up or whatever you

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,130
know any any kind of message that you

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,950
send to the user it's important that you

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:40,060
define you know a voice you know are you

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,080
are you knowledgeable are you too

00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,320
aggressive when you speak to your user

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:49,600
and so we provide what these guides

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,760
provide is actually a sort of set of

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,460
definitions of how for example this is

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,500
for Susan so how you should sound when

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,050
you speak to your user right so for

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,910
example in our case what we define this

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,090
is something we researched on and we

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,310
spoke to different teams - and this is

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,420
the the outcome of it so we are experts

00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:14,420
not too bossy and we were friendly but

00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,490
we're not informal that's the idea and

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,710
then you know once you define your voice

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,950
it's also it's also about the tone and

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,720
then we have conventions and rules we

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,610
even you know you can drill down to

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,860
things like acronyms for example how you

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,780
use acronyms and this is something that

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,350
is always you know we work closely with

00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:36,980
other sides of a product for example

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,380
branding marketing for example and then

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,060
the idea is that you know this is

00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,230
something that you don't need to define

00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,920
for your project because it's already

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,230
here and you know it goes on and on I

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:52,730
mean there's other great examples and

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:55,010
colors would be another one and this is

00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,789
you know here we define a color palette

00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:01,399
and we also

00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:04,009
you know if a guideline on how to use

00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,389
these colors you know what thing what

00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,629
works in terms of contrast for example

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:10,729
and and this is great because it means

00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:13,429
that you already have you know in this

00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:15,919
case you have variables for preprocessor

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,479
CSS preprocessor but you get an idea of

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,699
what works and what doesn't so you don't

00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:22,940
get you know you don't mix you know you

00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:28,070
don't have the text where dark text over

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:31,690
a dark background for example and so yes

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:37,759
and then there's should we show perhaps

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,499
icons we have only three minutes so yes

00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,819
that's that would be I mean please you

00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:46,459
know I encourage you to have a look and

00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:51,829
you know they just access the links on

00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:53,989
the on the slides and that's it yeah

00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:58,159
well yeah this is all for the

00:28:53,989 --> 00:29:00,199
presentation that we have I'm also sure

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,539
you've managed to see actually both all

00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:04,519
the time we have the links here down

00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,079
there at the footer so if you want to

00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,440
get in touch with us if you want to try

00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,929
out what we have there's a way you have

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,769
a links there yes this is design system

00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:17,599
comm there's some dos a URL we have

00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,999
twitter we have a lot of other things

00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,209
just get in touch with us get in touch

00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:26,599
with kissers and mouse it myself if you

00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:29,239
have any questions but we really we

00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:31,879
really encourage you to collaborate with

00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:35,809
us because we we're not just building

00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:38,949
the sue sale design systems many thought

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:42,049
actually this is open-source and we are

00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:43,879
helping us well the openSUSE design

00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:45,859
system and we kind of need a little bit

00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:47,509
of help there so the more help that we

00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:52,159
can get the better this product is going

00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:53,629
