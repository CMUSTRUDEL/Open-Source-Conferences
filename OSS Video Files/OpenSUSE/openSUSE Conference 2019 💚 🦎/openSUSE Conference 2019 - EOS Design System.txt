The solution to bring good UX to all OSS

In the past UX design was a commodity in the paid consumer world, where companies like Facebook, Google, Uber would invest millions on. Today the gap is closing. Enterprise and Open Source applications are in need of better UX too.

On the other hand, many companies of all different sizes struggle with today's IT agendas: bleeding edge software, agile development, short time-to-market, etc., and this "new" (and really not so) kid on the block is not making it any easier for developers and designers to keep up: UX design. 
Companies struggling in this scenario will eventually suffer from a big level of inconsistency in their products portfolio, and sometimes even in one same product.

Design Systems can help solve this problem, and a few more. Design Systems serve as a centralized source of information for UX, UI, and other brand-related guidelines that help not only developers find the UI element or component they need, but also designers to build faster prototypes while streamlining the collaboration between the two.

But, building a Design System can take a very long time and be very expensive, this is why we're building EOS: an Open Source and customizable Design System. 
In this presentation, we will talk more about the problem Design Systems solve, how we are building EOS, and how it can be of great benefit to your company or project.
