Flexible software defined storage management

I introduce OpenSDS that is an open source community working to address storage integration challenges. I remark technology. OpenSDS can manage LVM, Ceph, Cinder, and more as a software defined storage. and We can use OpenSDS in Kubernetes through CSI, Flexvolume, and Service Catalog. therefore, Kubernetes can use software defined storage by OpenSDS. I draw overview of Kubernetes - OpenSDS - storage relationship and explain one case of to build on Kubic.

This strategy bring us these benefits:
- If Administrator create PodPreset at SDS, Application developer don't need to prepare storage.
- If Administrator create storage pool, He don't need to create volume each request.

And I explain potential of replication with DRBD.

Participant can learn SDS strategy on Kubernetes with OpenSDS. and How to build on Kubic.
