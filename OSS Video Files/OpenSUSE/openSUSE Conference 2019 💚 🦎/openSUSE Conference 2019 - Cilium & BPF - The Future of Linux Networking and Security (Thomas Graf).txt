Linux is the dominant platform to run microservices using cloud-native architectures. These modern architectures impose new challenges on the platform serving the applications. We'll take a peek at BPF and Cilium and how it revolutionizes both networking and security to enable platforms built on top of it to fully utilize the benefits of cloud-native architectures. 

Thomas Graf is Co-Founder & CTO at Isovalent and creator of the Cilium project. Before this, Thomas has been a Linux kernel developer at RedHat for many years.
