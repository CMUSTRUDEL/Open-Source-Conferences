New features for rpmbuild

Right now many RPM spec files contain large parts of boiler plate code. In the current development cycle of RPM we try to help reducing this clutter. We hope we can make packaging easier by providing means to have pre-arranged building blocks and offer more control over larger sets of packages. This will also change the relation between RPM as a multipurpose tool and the single package/packager by adding a layer in between take will take care of common tasks.
This talk  will give a overview of the changes already done and still planned and will allow for discussion and feed back.
