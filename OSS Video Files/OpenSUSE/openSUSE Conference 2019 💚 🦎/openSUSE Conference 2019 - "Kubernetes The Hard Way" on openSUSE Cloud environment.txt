Let's build your own cloud

"Kubernetes" is one of the most popular and famous container orchestration open source software. And now, there are so many Kubernetes environments and deployment tools such as SUSE CaaS Platform, minikube, kubeadm, Rancher, GKE/AKS/EKS, etc. So, we can use or build a Kubernetes cluster with them very easily. However, it also prevents opportunities to understand Kubernetes technologies themselves from people who want to know the architecture itself. Therefore, if a Kubernetes cluster gets something wrong, it would be tough challenge to resolve it without such knowledge. For such a situation, here is a very good exercise document - "Kubernetes The Hard Way[0]" which is a tutorial for setting up Kubernetes the hard way on Google Cloud Platform(GCP). People can learn internal architecture of Kubernetes from that.

In this session, attendees will get an opportunity to know how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on not only GCP but also an openSUSE OpenStack cloud based on the tutorial, and, will get to know its technology deeply.
"Kubernetes The Hard Way"[0] has 14 chapters right now. And it's written for the GCP basically. However, it works on the other clouds (e.g. openSUSE OpenStack Cloud) with some modifications.
