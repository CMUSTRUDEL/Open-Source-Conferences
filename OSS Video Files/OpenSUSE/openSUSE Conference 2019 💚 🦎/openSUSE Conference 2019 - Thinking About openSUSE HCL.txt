Let's Keep HCL Updated

I have been a part of the Taiwan openSUSE community for almost a year. During this time, I was a volunteer at the openSUSE Asia Summit 2018, and I attended monthly openSUSE meet-ups. It feels great to have a group of people with whom to study and share knowledge.

In the new year, I am curious about how I can contribute to the community with my expertise as an OS certification technical manager in the server hardware industry. My job is to ensure the hardware product we make is compatible with as many operating systems as possible. 

Therefore, the first option I have looked into is the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).
Why does the HCL matter? There are four reasons:
1. For some users, an HCL is mandatory before ordering can be started. 
2. It increases the user base; by having an updated HCL, people can easily start to use it.
3. Providing a hardware compatibility process to hardware vendors so they can display openSUSE as a compatible OS to their customers could be a chance to increase visibility to users.
4. Establishing an easy-to-follow hardware testing policy may increase the number of hardware vendors and users available to do the test and to report more bugs, and it will make openSUSE more reliable.

The good news is that openSUSE already has an HCL on its wiki page, but we are still facing some challenges. Here, I listed four major problems:
1. The data are entirely outdated.
2. There is much inconsistent information.
3. There is a lack of real data from the real system.
4. Anyone can edit the existing HCL, which could make the data unreliable.

To solve the problems, I herein propose three approaches to improve the HCL:
1. Develop a simple test kit to record the hardware information from the testing hardware system and provide the result to the HCL by submitting logs.
2. Leverage the SUSE Yes Certification Programâ€™s result, listing the SUSE-certified servers in the openSUSE HCL.
3. Expand the HCL source from users to hardware vendors to collect HCL data from the source that are more reliable.

Ultimately, the HCL could develop into a hardware certification program, which can create more value. Adding more test cases can provide more compatibility between the hardware and openSUSE. In addition, we can create more policies to guide the hardware vendor, and we can even design a logo to prove compatibility in the market.

In the end, I will talk about the call to action.
If the audiences are interested in the idea, the HCL needs more people to become involved to:
1. Develop a test suite to collect the HW data; it must be expandable for adding more test cases in the future.
2. Create a basic guideline for the people who want to test their hardware and submit the logs to the openSUSE HCL.
3. Form a team/committee to oversee the process of submitting the HCL.

there are less there are 90 % of server

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,930
and 80% of desktop and double our

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,230
manufacturing from Taiwan so basically

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:07,229
what I do for living is to ensure those

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:10,920
products listed on every HCl which is

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,670
user won't air so number since I join

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,820
the community

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,799
I been thinking what I can do to

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,689
contribute to a community with my

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,110
knowledge since I'm not a good

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,000
programmer this is the Sun ok

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,770
and I found public suicide still might

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,220
be something that I can help

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,900
so today I'm going to talk about I'm

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,079
going to attack 30 minute to talk about

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,380
vengeance I sell what is it why does it

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:46,649
matter and probably some ideas that

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:49,290
might improve open-source RCL ok so this

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,990
is the whole line today but you know I'm

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,090
going to explain what is SEO and why we

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,359
need it and then we'll

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,399
the current openSUSE CEO and think what

00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,859
the chunk might we might have

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,170
and finally I'll list some ideas that

00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:09,090
might include Elvis was our CEO and it

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,709
can be updated so what is a sale here I

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,480
want to do a quick survey

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:18,920
and how many of you have heard about HDL

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,769
this is rest of ahead okay greatly

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,900
enhance and philosopher doesn't massive

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,569
head of these talk will give you some

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,180
ideas about myself and then for those

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,950
who you rest your hands I hope we can

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:39,209
discuss some as you know things during

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:44,730
our conference yeah okay this is

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:48,209
actually I mean actually it will by user

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,030
or by reference hardware is pub list of

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,760
the operating system so they can be sure

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,310
that the hard way they have or they are

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,690
going to purchase is going to work with

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:04,739
operating system perfectly so some I

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:08,430
know you people are very good at Linux

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,620
but some people in Asia like my mom they

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,230
don't know naturally don't know that is

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,560
oh so if they want to use Venice and

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,989
they are going to buy a hardware like a

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,260
laptop or desktop and how can life

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:25,099
issues what does our left is going to

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:30,450
work so this is one answer

00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:33,599
yeah so almost every operating system

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,389
have their own sail so today I'm

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,639
focusing on Linda so so we could have

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,700
some ideas about the factor that might

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,819
in fact people willing to update Co and

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:51,450
the pros and cons of each astrology sign

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:53,370
so I'll go through some SEO website so

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,560
I'll start with commerce on this rule

00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,219
like we have sorry about you

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,490
so first we can see it's rehab and

00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:15,840
actually

00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:22,670
I can go to the website okay so this is

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:27,030
rahat I still website and we can ensure

00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:41,730
they are in categories to this there I

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:49,940
still first we can see the summer okay

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:49,940
you can see there are lots of models and

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,420
now we can see in the pegs you can see

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,890
the model name and the company name and

00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:08,280
the compatible or version but what else

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:11,970
are missing in this page to me the

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,820
biggest problem I see is it length of

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,630
the detail highway information so we

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:22,380
don't know what exactly the network card

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:26,010
is compatible and also like storage they

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,820
are compatible so if my mother is is

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,700
exactly as this one but if I switch the

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,670
network adapter is in still compatible

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,990
that that's what what I don't know but

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:42,210
actually on my job is to put the father

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,540
on this list so actually we're doing a

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,580
lot of things beyond this table but I

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:52,310
don't know why they didn't show the

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,310
details so I think the Dino is better

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,770
okay the second one I want to look at

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:06,060
the laptop so the other corner I saw is

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:09,260
the laptop is very only few numbers in

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,870
this list so it's hard to

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:22,330
users to reference this list because

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:25,160
there are only two numbers yeah okay I

00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,640
guess the Internet's not good so i

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:33,220
screenshot of them directly see the

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:37,510
websites better then we can see Susur

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:41,210
Souza is also list of certain models and

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,490
unlike Rihan they actually list detailed

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,030
information for users so we can

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,670
reference it directly so if you your

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:53,270
model is not listed but you can actually

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,760
check your components on these days like

00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,520
you have a sense if you you also have

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,770
sent the adapter that you use do is

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:08,630
still matter to you but like we had the

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:11,900
same problems the client does not like

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:17,660
overlap Thomas very few so his only have

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:23,720
38 models for less 15 yeah so it's very

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:26,660
cheap okay so we jump to one to one but

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,650
actually have lots of Natalia that

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,840
someone release but it also provide the

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,920
digital public information but the

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,930
problem is it has to join the membership

00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,450
program before you can toss your

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,480
products our list which is no more like

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:48,920
that we commerce official did it but the

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:51,170
Ubuntu member speak is relatively high

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:55,340
so not every company can join this

00:07:51,170 --> 00:08:01,220
program so like our zoning day we didn't

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:04,070
have the program to put this on okay so

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,500
about these numbers on this room so I

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,320
hear our summary how to achieve all this

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,840
first so they all have a great ecosystem

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,810
that in who all the ha way vendors

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,320
the Ohio TM HP is me

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,290
so work together to to put to make this

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,110
list and the second one is they also

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,960
provide a test suite so they have a

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,270
automation tool for you to run the test

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,450
and make sure the hardware is compatible

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,050
so otherwise they also provide lots of

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:42,120
document and hope one is - where you

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:45,570
have a review process so they review if

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,270
all the test instance of house and they

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,460
have no there is no proprietary drivers

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:57,690
in your system right yeah and also of

00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:01,830
course the website ok so now we are

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:05,880
seeing a community distrust so at this

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:08,850
some demos this first year and we are

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,380
going to don't only save see the pros

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:24,530
and cons so first of all I want to see

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:28,230
ladies they show a lot of hardware

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,160
troubleshooting information in the main

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,690
head which is very good for users to

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,589
from shooting their problems with

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,589
hardware and

00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:52,850
we can see I'm still at Valley State

00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:56,449
this is a wiki best Excel so you does

00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:06,889
anyone see any problems here for SEO and

00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:10,069
user to reference any ideas okay to me I

00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:18,139
think the biggest are behind size is

00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:20,179
this okay yeah and absolutely it's kind

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,089
of confused to me because I don't know

00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:26,600
what okay actually me like I've never

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:30,049
car you don't know this speed okay or is

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,959
link okay so I don't know what exactly

00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:35,239
and we didn't provide a standard

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,089
procedure to test your hardware so if I

00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:41,779
want to update my models in this list I

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,669
don't know if my mother is actually okay

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:44,839
because different people have different

00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,939
opinion

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:52,569
yeah and the second problem I see is

00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:55,309
there are some people list their

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:59,149
component name here but some people

00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:03,199
don't so I think in order to that people

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,959
can easily reference your model I think

00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:10,129
the component detail is very important

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:14,049
so if you have tested your model I think

00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:25,999
this battery you can also provide your

00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:31,249
hardware details so the second the

00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:34,939
second part is I think the update is not

00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:41,779
very actively I think it's okay because

00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:45,019
like 2000 2018 is to have three updates

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:48,380
but I think there are more updates here

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:51,320
so actually think way too

00:11:48,380 --> 00:12:01,430
increment people to updates Excel list

00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:03,550
yeah okay business ugliness and then we

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,170
see that VM

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,240
Deborah is using their own database

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:11,750
through Europe recall the device that

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,240
compatible with with dead Debian I think

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:18,320
it's a smart way to ask people copy the

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,620
result of MLS PCI into a column and give

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,540
you certain idea what if their component

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,600
are compatible or not so here it

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:35,990
actually my my dancehall back at Taiwan

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:41,810
and I use as decide to put my devising

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:44,480
vote here and colleague check so he will

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:49,010
tells you what come on is compatible and

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,560
why not and you might be wondering how

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:56,480
to like determine is that whether you're

00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:01,120
top of its work on that this column is

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,920
basic user input so if you check my

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,500
couple things okay then then you will

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,640
tells you it's okay so you can also

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,640
include if you found out like your to

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,520
say driver is fine and you can say back

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:22,010
to them okay I think the blue side of

00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,620
this matter is that everyone can

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,670
precisely understand if their hardware

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,670
is working properly

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,710
in device label but the downside of the

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,500
matter is obviously you need to apply

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,710
the computer first and when you went

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,160
else you not working it's probably too

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,830
late so yeah because we didn't provide a

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,450
system level compared interview for user

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,740
to our furnace reference

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,120
yeah like the matter

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,270
or something then we can see federal law

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,980
federal was used within as a CEO like

00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:02,300
our clinics and also openSUSE Excel and

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:05,480
but they decided economy after 2016 3

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:09,020
because the SEM was not being actively

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,020
update for a while and later users who

00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,980
reference rehab Estill but we saw

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:19,210
earlier is not easy to reference

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:23,060
especially for desktop or laptop and

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:25,610
then we can see Santos simple doesn't

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,520
have a cell the Tony search reference

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,460
rehash you know directly since Santos is

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,100
spewed from the 7 source code this

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:46,940
person with its recent module reference

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:49,310
has HCl yeah how do you communicate is

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:54,110
from you with as you know I think they

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:57,560
can divide it into four types so first

00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:01,070
one is we keep as a CEO is very common

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:05,360
and also open Susur is you that this

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:09,260
matter and the second one is like what

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,530
Debian do is device driver technical

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,290
database and third one is to reference

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:19,190
other existing database like central

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:23,060
scheme and then the four points number

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,300
by still adult lighting elementary OS or

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:34,180
some damning these folks didn't provide

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:34,180
0 so let's look at open society

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:45,600
I've screenshot the officers I still

00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:54,019
sometimes see maybe I'd already go to

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:54,019
the website okay

00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:10,329
so we can see the categories here and

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:13,690
let me call it one of them okay so we

00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:16,240
can choose the brand you have for

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:21,040
example my desktop and answer so I

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,970
couldn't answer so we can see the paps

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,180
here it's very light alkalinity and the

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,300
use checkmark to tells you whether it's

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,850
compatible or not but I think the plumb

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,160
line is sent as our cleanings because we

00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,779
don't know actually don't know the check

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:46,660
mark mean like actually I tried to put

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:50,230
my records on this HCl and this wise my

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:53,649
is confused me to see whether the video

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,610
car is working and whether my network

00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:01,529
are working because they are making a

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:04,529
precisely procedure to do the tasks so

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:04,529
sorry

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,939
so I think the products we need a

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:18,209
precisely procedure to test these

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:23,290
components and also the format is not

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:25,750
consistent because some people put a

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,059
check mark and some people list

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,059
component information yeah

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:42,230
and it was Zeeland history this is me

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:46,930
I'm Josh before me it's 2010 summer not

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,930
many people are attending these days

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,450
okay now we are rounding though the

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,890
problem might be

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:02,990
so I summary the partners I think the

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,120
number one is they are too easily out

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,240
dented infinite wise maintaining the

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,020
picture and the second one is there are

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,360
a lot of information we don't have

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:19,310
actually timeline to guiding people how

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:24,730
to update this list and otherwise alike

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:30,140
a specific validation process like how

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:33,190
to test our components and the fall is

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,160
lack of detail hardware information and

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,320
the final one I think this is not

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,800
everyone know how to edit wikipad

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:46,550
because for ninety first I think there's

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,890
some research on how to update list so

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,580
if you have model and you have the

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:58,100
passion to updated then you will you

00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:01,340
might be eventually then not want to out

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:09,140
there because we keep the format is not

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:11,240
you're familiar with okay so I want to

00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,220
rethinking openSUSE zero

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,280
I've been talking to several people back

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,140
in Taiwan about charges a crown and it

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,140
is interesting to me to everything

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:25,220
doens't SEO and how can we solve those

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:28,760
challenges so here are our assignment

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,740
snakes going through code for law school

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,679
about in his right

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:38,760
also one of the most inspired speaker

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:41,460
and Ted so people leave people who

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,010
become things is because why you are

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,090
doing it the motivation behind the

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:50,490
actions so I start with why what we want

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,940
to provide and as you know for users

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,190
possible purpose I think why we are

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,800
doing it is because people should know

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,540
if their hard way to work with openSUSE

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,150
people that using so in order to do that

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,600
we will provide external for them and

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:11,820
the things we are currently doing is to

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,820
check the nestle first before you buy

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,890
the hardware and selectively you if you

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,059
might Harbor and your hardware actually

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:23,520
would into your model open-source I

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:30,690
still we keep apps so this is what we're

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:33,990
doing done so but we solve problems so

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,210
there are three ideas came up with aunt

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:42,120
Ida starts with several people back in

00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:44,490
Taiwan so this ideas is not testing mine

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,280
things not practical but I think they

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:51,179
are working to discuss so I'm extending

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,840
shove them in following slide so first

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:58,260
one is ideas to create a sale program

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,110
the cornerstone of the idea is to invite

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:05,490
hardware vendors or users to test their

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:07,410
hardware the obviously advantage is no

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,110
one should be the guinea pig to buy the

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,280
first half way without knowing this work

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,280
or not

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,910
so that's how my men don't do it while

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,550
they are making so because my my job is

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:24,720
in half wave endeavor so I think we have

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,210
lots of hobbies tend to eat if we have a

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,740
harder program

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:34,300
then how to do it so they are several

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:39,740
things we should do to star sale program

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:42,560
so things like providing book I like to

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,590
attest half way and a single task tool

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,050
to test hardware and grant love

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,570
collecting process and find a way to

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,490
redo locks automatically because we we

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,760
are we don't have much people to review

00:21:52,490 --> 00:22:00,800
love everyone and the post results who

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,290
has sale yeah so the second year is test

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,720
at first sight the idea is tuning by

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,170
users to test their hardware while the

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,920
first time login so the steps are like

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:15,620
following so when you log in for some

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:19,490
Aqaba will come wizard that inviting

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,370
user to test their hardware and the only

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,150
test measure components like critic like

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,250
of you and that he should be finished in

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,720
couple minutes because user don't have

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:35,420
much passion to actually test too long

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:39,740
and third one is that user decide they

00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:44,410
want to post the result SEO and focus to

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,410
mark different levels on the website

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,150
like insane mother will have recording

00:22:50,270 --> 00:23:00,860
like hundred times you want some or

00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:03,680
something like that and again see i

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:07,880
think this is more easy to do it is

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:10,400
provided by phone in kiev still so we

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,890
provide specific states to guiding user

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,550
test the hardware properly and provide

00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,920
resolving a set up for back so we got

00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:22,850
users how to test their hardware company

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,029
there are several tools can help users

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,879
to we do

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:30,069
and suggesting you searching for death

00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:32,229
help us in that process like where you

00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:35,139
can get the balloon in we can get the

00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:37,149
component in and someone has been

00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:43,899
turning more people who have the

00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:46,329
hardware models on list okay so oh three

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:50,649
years are talking about testing the

00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:53,049
hardware and I want to introduce former

00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:59,229
Susa test framework so if you have an

00:23:53,049 --> 00:24:04,539
idea how it works so I'm not sure if you

00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:06,759
have heard about this however does

00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:17,919
anyone here destroy people

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:22,539
okay no it is black back to run the tool

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:28,929
the hard way prop actually very fast

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:34,149
we only take a few seconds for users

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:39,629
with each other hardware information he

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:42,309
will give you a few idle and motels you

00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:48,929
pause on the website and once your model

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:48,929
and your component work or dance

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,640
you might wonder really determining

00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:09,610
whether or not is similar like that it

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:12,490
is a user feedback that happens and in

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,800
the end we will put some information

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:21,580
here so check know the details of

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:29,050
hardware so actually I think is a good

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:31,690
way to prop your hardware okay second

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,870
one is a lot avocados test framework is

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:37,560
I think it's initialed from the Hat and

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,930
it's a framework to test its basic

00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:46,300
Python and I think the test group is

00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:52,930
very easy to agree so you can test your

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:56,020
hardware by the Python COI and it will

00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:00,850
give you something like by this this is

00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:03,880
a perfect test so you know shows how

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:06,220
many ace and how many fail so I think

00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,930
it's the idea so we can test a highway

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,930
in a more structured way

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,490
okay the third one is the instance

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:22,030
program is a very bold program is

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,870
passing on C proxy language and the test

00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:30,100
guys are very large I I believe we have

00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:35,500
a 1800 test cases to test your own

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:39,100
internal so this is one way and finally

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,990
is for Monday's test suite is also open

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,360
source and I think it's interesting

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:50,160
because the view of this test way is

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,160
based around the benchmark so the test

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,650
so in the end of this test you will give

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:05,170
you a benchmark the benchmark number and

00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,140
you will compare with other models how's

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:11,410
your CPU is working is review better

00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:16,180
than other Hardware models so I think is

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:18,190
interesting and ending and you will post

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:25,180
on the website so people can reference

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:28,480
your you're halfway models okay so those

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:31,240
are the three ideas I can I think we we

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:39,790
should we might have the chance to do it

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:43,410
to actually be the purpose okay that's

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:43,410
no conference

00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:44,100
I think it's mostly okay if if I

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,920
actually test those lost hardware I

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,530
think most ways it will be okay but I

00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,560
think we should let people know your

00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,290
hardware is okay and not I think the

00:28:52,560 --> 00:29:00,920
issue should be report to the how a

00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:05,670
vendor before they actually sell the car

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:07,440
does that answer your question how much

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:12,740
it's okay man we can discuss everything

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,740
yeah so any other questions

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,840
okay thank you

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,900
[Applause]

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,900
