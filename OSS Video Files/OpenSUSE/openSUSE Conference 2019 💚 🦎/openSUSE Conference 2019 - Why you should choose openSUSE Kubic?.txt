openSUSE Kubic is really fun!

In the past few years, the development of container application technology has advanced by leaps and bounds. But for people who want to enter a containers word still hard for them. Most of people stop at the first step that use Kubernetes to setup environment. As a opsnSUSE user Iâ€™m glad we have openSUSE Kubic. I would like to share people who frustrated to build container. All they should do are use openSUSE Kubic. They need new tools that make them easy to set up cluster and maintain. OpenSUSE Kubic is great platform to run containers and to learn how to containerize. 
Hope through my experience of use Kubic can share it for people who want to join open source and containers word. There always have a best way to help you management your IT infrastructure and work smart.
