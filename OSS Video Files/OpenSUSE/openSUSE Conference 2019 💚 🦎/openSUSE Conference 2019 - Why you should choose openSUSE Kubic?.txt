openSUSE Kubic is really fun!

In the past few years, the development of container application technology has advanced by leaps and bounds. But for people who want to enter a containers word still hard for them. Most of people stop at the first step that use Kubernetes to setup environment. As a opsnSUSE user Iâ€™m glad we have openSUSE Kubic. I would like to share people who frustrated to build container. All they should do are use openSUSE Kubic. They need new tools that make them easy to set up cluster and maintain. OpenSUSE Kubic is great platform to run containers and to learn how to containerize. 
Hope through my experience of use Kubic can share it for people who want to join open source and containers word. There always have a best way to help you management your IT infrastructure and work smart.

invite me to here and let's start my

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,899
topic it's about why you should choose

openSUSE cubic and it's for a person

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,230
beginner in territorial can't continue

topic and first motivation to use cubic

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,690
is for people who just want to know I

want to play cabanas the hard way I

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,930
think 80% people if layers don't have

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,729
container background or knowledge they

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:19,079
will fulfill or give up while setting up

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:21,329
communities and second is for native

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,570
English user you know it's still not

00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:28,020
enough in my information in Chinese as I

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,399
know a lot of IT leftists information

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,950
will translate to Japanese and French

00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,259
immediately but knowing Chinese and for

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,140
people who are famer with common life

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,950

quail and container service performed

00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:50,920
based on kubernetes atop openSUSE mac OS

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,140
openSUSE is micros is a modern Linux

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,940
operating system designed for container

00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:03,190
horse and optimized for large deployment

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:06,549
ok enhanced tumbling and cast and so

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:10,209
surely if you've ever to use tampering

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:15,870
and you want to use container cubic is

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:19,780

cubic full name first its container

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,840
what is it container and wise

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,180
micro-service container is containerized

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,430
everything like always that you can

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,449
build ship and wrong everywhere and

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:50,500
every environment and a kitchen like

00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:52,780
kubernetes can manage calm container in

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,449
easy way and micro service what the

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,180
banco service is a giant application

00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:02,620
contains with multiple components abyss

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:06,129
it's hard to know right so sign learn

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:11,199
not used not staying application deliver

00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:15,069
have the bride shall change now deb-deb

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,680
development region you should deploy

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:22,840
your container or environment morph

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,870
faster and all this traditional model

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,220
Mon know ladies Association face no

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,800
problem

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,740
morale is approaching to now meet our

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,979
common

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,340
and vien anson different results and

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:41,419
management overhand is hard to control

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:45,110
the traditional at culture so you can

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:50,120
choose micro surface of creation now do

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:54,800
one thing and do it well but no naÃ­vi

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,860
people suitable micro-service if you you

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,660
you give her baby so use my kouzef

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,340
they don't have know how to play make a

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:07,220
service right so micro race is micro

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,630
service press container and many small

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,229
workers container

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:16,669
let's make yourself first KKT service

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:19,580
that can well defined application and in

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,729
packing language library you can build

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,860
your own container very faster and

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,280
modular easy maintenance and reuse and

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:35,419
they have provided for tourists and

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:39,650
scale or bo scale out bt - for you so

it's easy stating cursor associate

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,280
maintain ease as well now you can you

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,699
trying know about cubic solo thing they

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:55,130
are looking to use Kubek

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:57,500
ok let stars or little riff about cubic

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:03,789
before install you should have a payment

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:07,060
all like x-axis and 64 or arm machine

00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:13,490
and download a copy i saw from

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:16,130
Kubik wiki or if internet is no I saw

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:20,270
its last learn to gigabyte and system

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,460
require just choose debut and 2 gigabyte

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,389
memory and certificate up a mini

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:29,090
hardware it's very small and we are a

00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:31,699
storm could be IDM season certified

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,250
kubernetes tech can bring using to

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,750
Beijing at top of micro service best

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:43,479
system and is easy rage like just like

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:47,889
you install tambourine first install

00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:54,309
and she's next and she's kabedon note

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:59,020
and OD 4 and choose your password and

00:06:54,309 --> 00:07:03,159
it's different to use and when you build

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:05,650
the Copic you should have installed two

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,499
or more serum with openSUSE cubic and

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:15,339
you can follow could be wiki step by

00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:19,180
