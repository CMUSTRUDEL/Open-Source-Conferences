Situation normal - all fine

Another year - another security retrospective.

The talk will introduce the SUSE security team and its members, our areas of work
and responsibilities.

The talk will show some statistics and interesting details of last year security issues, and go in detail on some of the specific codenamed ones.

A special focus will be on updated classification and overview of last years Meltdown and Spectre like CPU issues, describing them and the mitigations that SUSE has been deployed.

As the SUSE security team has grown in the last year, we also increased our work in both proactive security and related areas, which the talk will briefly highlight
