You should not believe everything that Big Money tells you.....

Everyone knows that Free Software such as Linux, Apache or PostgreSQL are the backbone of many data centers (DC) and cloud offerings. The Internet as we know it today would not exist without Free & OpenSource Software (FOSS)
But the more Free Software leaves the DC and gets closer to the 'Enduser', the more myth are build around FOSS. 
Linux on a Desktop? GIMP Instead of Photoshop? Running your business on a Free ERP-System? Fear, Uncertainty and Doubts (FUD) are spread to protect market share for proprietary solutions.
In this talk I will take a look at some FUD, and share some thoughts about answers to the myths.

yeah I would afternoon everybody we are

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,670
already on the final straight of the

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:18,430
openSUSE conference 2019 slowly heading

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,999
towards the finish line my name is axel

00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:27,519
Brown and I will tell you about

00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:31,230
demystifying thoughts so what are fats

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:35,980
fat is an acronym that stands for fears

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,460
uncertainty and doubts and these fears

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,450
uncertainties and doubts are usually

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,450
spread by interested parties in order to

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,010
make you scared to change away from

00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,260
their products and away from their

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,390
services

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,060
there are many thoughts around free

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,790
software in the market because free

00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:02,170
software is also a game changer for

00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,960
established companies and in this case

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:12,040
it's just a threat to their business

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,800
model so everybody is mostly ok if free

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,490
software is somewhere in the server room

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,400
I mean the Internet as we have it right

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,920
now would not exist if there is no free

00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,380
software so as long as it stays

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,229
somewhere on a very technical level

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,979
everybody's happy with it but as soon as

00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:35,409
it gets up into closer to the user or

00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:40,840
closer to the business then the people

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:43,720
get scared so next to my board hat from

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,270
openSUSE I'm also in the core team of

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,540
the new health project and this is one

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,990
of these typical business applications

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:57,400
that are highly affected by the

00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:01,570
spreading of fudge so the new health is

00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,420
basically an ERP system enterprise

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,340
resource planning system that allows you

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,759
to run your business or in this case

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,090
your practitioners office or a hospital

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,640
so it consists of various layers we're

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,650
starting with person and community so

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,959
all the stuff

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,599
you just need to identify a person his

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,360
lifestyle where he lives and what

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:29,200
conditions and so on the next layer is

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,620
typically covered by so-called AMR

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,739
electronic medical records systems this

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,209
is the layer when a person gets sick and

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:40,150
enters a practice or a hospital

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:44,680
everything that has to do with the

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:48,940
person with timing's with analysis and

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,319
so on then we have the ERP layer the

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,050
instance the management of the health

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,850
institutions so that can be a laboratory

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,340
information system that can be a

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,650
pharmacy stock-keeping

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,160
financial accounting on oil that stuff

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,160
around and on the last layer we still

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,680
have some additional functionality for

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,040
health authorities respectively the

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,989
Ministry of Health and this allows the

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:20,080
ministry for example to run Vasa nation

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:24,370
campaigns or analysis over the health of

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,829
the of the people so if you want to know

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,989
more about this take a look at the

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:31,180
presentation from Luis on the very

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,930
first day he was talking about federated

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,959
networks with new health so no hell's

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,650
are such as such a free software it's

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:47,440
not a new package and it uses basically

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:51,519
only three components running on Linux

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,500
based systems or BSD it uses the

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,459
Postgres database it's programmed in

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:03,880
Python it sits on top of the Trident ERP

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:06,280
framework it uses the new PG for example

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,239
for encryption for death or birth

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,819
certificates or or digitally signed

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:19,109
prescriptions so many programs that you

00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:22,720
can get especially for your cell phone

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:24,669
garages but they are not free garages

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,530
means you don't have to pay with it and

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,539
the first plans but if you look closer

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,660
into it you're mostly paying with your

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,780
data for it

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,370
but free in our case means really free

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,330
that means it offers you the four

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,430
freedoms to run as you like to

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,430
distribute the version or the copy of

00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,950
the program that you're currently having

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,830
to help others and learn so you can

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,710
drool into this software analyze the

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,520
code and change it by yourself and you

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:58,370
can distribute the change source codes

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,690
to give it other to give it to others

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,230
and to improve the program so some

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,730
examples I think these are some of the

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,280
finest programs in the world

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,970
for example the Firefox browser is still

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,630
my favorite after so many years KDE

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,050
desktop for my personal feeling is one

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,310
of the most flexible and ergonomic

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,970
desktop environments that I can think

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,430
about

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,350
Postgres database is definitely

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,170
something that is enterprise ready and

00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:34,930
Libre Office provides you basically with

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:38,920
all the functionalities that you need

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,760
there are many other applications

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:46,430
available as free software and nearly

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,800
everybody uses it in between even our

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,169
so-called competitors if you think about

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,090
for example the Amazon which is looking

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,360
for new stuff over here there are a

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,970
heavy user of free software but for

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,960
example even Microsoft is using Linux in

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,200
between otherwise the cloud service xuer

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,090
which would not work so but nevertheless

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,940
I mean I'm coming from a business

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,010
consultancy side I've done enterprise

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,320
architecture IT strategy and something

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,080
like that and talked quite regularly to

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,590
people on the sea level so CIO CEO

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,380
something like that and if you when you

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,380
talk with them about free software you

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,410
end up in some popular so-called

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,970
thoughts one of them is well free

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,210
software hey this is something this is

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,500
coded by nerds in their back room and

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:46,729
the piece our slice on the keyboard and

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:50,780
what I know yeah maybe I don't know

00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,820
about your office situation but for some

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,880
reasons this may be true I mean many

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,190
people or many projects started very

00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,900
small with the single person leanest

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,300
hallward's was a student at that point

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,710
in time Richard Stallman started with

00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,720
his canoe utils also very much alone but

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,090
as soon as the software was released

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
into the wild there was really a big

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,580
momentum where others were picking the

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,450
software up and we're trying to improve

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:23,479
this so nowadays we have already the

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,910
case that many big companies contribute

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:29,240
to free software as well of course

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:32,330
mostly because they need it and they can

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,820
take advantage of it IBM for example has

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,940
bought read it for the small amount of

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,000
thirty four billion dollars so if

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,300
somebody like IBM is paying thirty four

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,760
million dollars I think we can be sure

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,710
that there is a market for free software

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:55,150
and that they're somehow trying to

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,950
monetize this to get the money back so

00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:03,050
free software is only coded by nerds and

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:06,860
backrooms I think this is wrong another

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:10,760
one is the quality of code is low you

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,590
see the company XYZ they are the market

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,760
leader and their software must be good

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,590
because they are market leader it's the

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,169
quality of code better because the

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:27,050
company has a high market share I would

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:30,500
say no there is a company who does

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:34,370
regularly code scans the court cavity

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,589
and they have analyzed proprietary

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,140
solutions as well as open source

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:44,000
software and what they found is the

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:47,060
amount of bugs per line of code and if

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,110
you see this here proprietary software

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,649
has mostly 50% more bugs in it and free

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,850
software

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,850
and this is quite simple maybe this

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,480
company has 50 developers but free

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,619
software communique may have 500

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,619
developers looking at the same piece of

00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:09,559
code and then it's quite obvious why why

00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:13,730
barks are fined more often and quite

00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:16,459
quickly so that the quality of code is

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,800
low is definitely wrong the quality of

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,749
code and free software projects is

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:28,759
mostly higher than within commercial

00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:31,819
projects another thing that scares

00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:35,259
people especially on the CIO level is

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:38,809
that well if this is free that means

00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:41,480
everybody can change the code this is

00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:45,740
complete anarchy anybody can change

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,129
anything and just kind of be good so

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,490
what is the fact the fact is that first

00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:54,619
of all almost all projects basically use

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,579
version controlled systems whether this

00:09:54,619 --> 00:10:00,529
is mercurial or gate whatever so within

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,720
this version control system you can

00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:06,730
identify basically any change that has

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:12,470
to be has been made organizational a

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:15,499
project mostly doesn't allow I call it a

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,600
newbie somebody just coming in to get in

00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:21,019
hey you're not becoming a core committer

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,050
and you can improve the code no it needs

00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:26,319
trust even here in the zoo's a community

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:30,259
where we have a so called to accuracy

00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:32,449
those who do decide you can do anything

00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:35,389
what you like in your own homer's

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:38,959
repository but as soon as it gets into a

00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:41,749
development project then the maintenance

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,360
of this project who are reviewing what

00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:46,699
you've done in this package before it

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,549
gets submitted into OBS and they make

00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:51,319
sure that the quality is right the next

00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:53,449
step that you then have to take is when

00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:55,579
you submit it to a factory there are

00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:57,379
even harder checks for this there is a

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,360
lawyer who's looking over there to make

00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:01,189
sure that this piece of code that you're

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,279
submitting is under the right license

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:06,019
that it is a free software license and

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,050
not the whole project into danger

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:15,019
because it contains some proprietary

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:17,990
code all right so before the change

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,809
really gets into the core there are a

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,139
couple of reviews you can do what you

00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:26,959
want at home when nobody's looking at

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:31,459
you but definitely not in the project

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:34,720
that you are committing to so this fact

00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:40,819
that everybody can change anything is

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:44,319
definitely wrong so once you have the

00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:48,949
system up and running you need support

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:52,129
if you buy software from vendor you have

00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:57,949
exactly one winner from whom you can get

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:59,839
support free software due to the fact

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,110
that is free and if you share knowledge

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,329
it gets more and not less in a free

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,509
software project you usually have more

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:11,209
than one vendor who can look into the

00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:14,209
code who can provide service and you

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:17,209
have the freedom to choice you to choose

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:19,759
your software partner here you are free

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:24,529
to select the vendor from whom you want

00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:26,809
to gain your support additionally to do

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,819
this we have various models of

00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:31,430
collaboration for example of freemium

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,680
commercial model that means the base of

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,589
the software is free if you want

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:42,889
additional features you have to pay for

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:46,370
it and buy this to become the company as

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:50,329
such gains income so that there is no

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,910
support is definitely wrong on the other

00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,920
hand what I would like to add here if

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,230
you have a commercial company and I'm

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,329
talking about really a big software

00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,759
vendor at the moment it does not

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,429
necessarily mean that you - the fact

00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,129
that you pay a high amount of money and

00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:10,699
we're talking here about 22% of the

00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:13,579
license fees annually for maintenance

00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:14,959
cost did you receive a good service so I

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:17,930
have at the moment a high priority

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,060
ticket open which does van

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,220
which affects basically the whole

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,110
material requirements planning when in

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,520
within one of the production plans but

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,190
you start working properly under certain

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,680
circumstances so it is really affects

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,630
the stock level this affects production

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,780
after three months they have not even

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,970
finished the the analysis of this buck

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,600
and I cannot say that this is the

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:48,680
service level which is worse 22 percent

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:56,480
license fees annually so another popular

00:13:48,680 --> 00:14:00,560
thing free software's unsecured okay so

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,680
first of all yeah and free software we

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,110
usually don't have a threat by patch

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,830
days if you return bull weed user you

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,560
know that new software including Patras

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,130
comes around mostly every day and some

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,730
cases where open QA test fails it takes

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,980
a little bit longer that means we have

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:27,790
maybe only two or three days where we

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,790
get after which we get again an update

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,810
if the software is disclosed or if the

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:42,860
code is not disclosed is it more secure

00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:45,800
why in general not because this security

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,420
by obscurity has never really worked and

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,200
this is the reason why we still see so

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:55,160
many so-called zero-day exploits that

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,170
effect especially users of a certain

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,780
desktop operating system that's going to

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,650
take away so yeah take a look at the

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:07,520
back slide another thing is that the

00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:11,000
free software community mostly reacts

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:15,980
much faster on new threats than

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,449
commercial vendors so this is also

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,500
situation or a fact that cavity has

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:26,610
found out so an average the Linux kernel

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:29,519
developers need six days if you think

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:33,569
one week back we had the so-called

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,779
zombie load back a nubuck affecting

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:38,970
Intel processors the patch was available

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:43,800
after one hour after this book was

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:46,440
released one hour now it needs to go

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,040
into the to the kernel maintenance site

00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:57,110
a cycle and will be available quite

00:15:50,040 --> 00:16:00,350
shortly so free software's unsecured

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,350
definitely not

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:09,290
so another thing common sense you know

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:13,470
maybe your aunt or grandmother says oh

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:15,589
what next cross that is onyx what costs

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,360
nothing is nothing

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:22,680
yeah I would say the best things in life

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,459
still are free so just the fact that

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,130
you're not paying license fees upfront

00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:33,449
doesn't mean that free software doesn't

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,180
cost anything so if you're introducing

00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:39,269
software into a larger scale into your

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,699
company then you're affected basically

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,490
by the similar or the same cost blocks

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:47,430
that you're having when you're

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,940
introducing proprietary software so that

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,589
starts for the costs for introduced for

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,290
introduction of the software and

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,209
consulting so usually if you don't have

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,579
two skills by yourself if you are not

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,620
willing or able to build them you can

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:03,480
buy them on the market so you need to

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,659
have a couple of consultants come in to

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,790
run the project if you have a project

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,650
you need some project management project

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,010
managers you really don't work for free

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,010
as well

00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:20,909
25 years ago we did a software

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:24,569
evaluation for production planning and

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:27,630
control system for a customer and we

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:30,929
asked various software vendors for a

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,480
request for information and we got from

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,059
one customer Dion or from one vendor the

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,100
answer work our software is highly

00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:42,600
customizable there is no additional

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:46,350
development needed yeah we laughing loud

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,110
and in fact you basically need small

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,090
adaptions and if there are only if this

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,070
is only the layout of the invoices the

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,620
additional header the footer or whatever

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,299
you always need some small developments

00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,730
or larger developments in your castle in

00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,010
your in your software and here you of

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,990
course have to pay for it when you

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,210
introduce it and its new to the people

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:12,720
you need to train them training costs

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:14,610
money once you're in the stage that you

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,100
finished all your building you go to

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,590
testing the so called user acceptance

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,409
test to make sure that this is what you

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,870
want to reuse in is supporting your

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:26,909
business so this are the users and the

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,510
key users need to run through test

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:35,940
cycles that binds their workforce that

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:38,820
means we have some costs here as well

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,340
and finally we need to have some kind of

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,679
document documentation where you can

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:48,600
look up what the special customizing for

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:51,139
your company are finally once the

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,429
software is introduced you have usually

00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:56,370
two weeks four weeks eight weeks

00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:59,190
so-called hyper cafes where the project

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,460
team stays on site and make sure that

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:06,000
upcoming issues are soft and in the

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,679
quick time and after this hyper care

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,929
phase is finished your hand this over to

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,419
the maintenance team and yeah

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:14,130
maintaining a running software is also

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:20,580
something where you have to allocate a

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:23,130
little bit budget for so basically we

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,299
have all these cost blocks as well but

00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,149
finally we have no license fees

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:32,179
not only license fees and all the mess

00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:35,119
around it to give you an example the

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:37,339
German government pays annually 250

00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,649
million euros just for desktop licenses

00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:43,609
and they're not really sure whether this

00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:48,469
is the full truth or not so traffic

00:19:43,609 --> 00:19:50,839
little excursion to licenses if you look

00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:54,139
at licenses of commercial software

00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,209
Windows not only the end user License

00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,179
Agreement which you always click away

00:19:56,209 --> 00:20:02,389
when it comes up during installation you

00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:04,899
find out that these licenses are quite

00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:08,059
complicated there are companies

00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:10,969
specialized on consulting and license

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:13,459
questions this is not something that you

00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:19,249
read right after dinner in the evening

00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:21,259
right to make sure that you are paying

00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:23,839
license fees in a proper manner the

00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:24,559
software supplier is doing out its every

00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,589
now and then

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,559
so they come along and do metering say

00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:37,909
oh you have registered 2,000 names users

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:39,859
but we see 2,500 so please pay every now

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:42,859
and then I mean we have a saturated

00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:44,859
market especially on the ERP so if you

00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:47,359
want to grow there how can you do that

00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:49,519
this is like the citron you know when

00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,999
you want to get the rest out of it so

00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,919
you have to get the money basically from

00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:57,109
the allocated customer base if you

00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,389
cannot increase the customer base so you

00:20:57,109 --> 00:21:02,749
see every now and then license changes

00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:06,979
and one well-known thing here is the so

00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:10,700
called indirect usage so this indirect

00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:15,070
usual usage was introduced by also a

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,159
large software company they found out

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:20,200
their customer has a CRM system running

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,579
in a cloud

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,739
whyare which the customers of the

00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:28,070
customer are ordering their products so

00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:32,539
the CRM system was creating in the ERP

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,860
system a sales document this is not done

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:36,679
by

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,019
I say it's Clerk it could be done and

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,429
it's not really done by yeah it's

00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,019
finally done by a customer but you

00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,779
cannot license the customer as such

00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,669
because all the customers of Amazon if

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:49,039
you think about this 40 million

00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,200
customers maybe that Amazon s here you

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,960
cannot ask for a license fee for each of

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,330
this customer so the software company

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,700
said well you have an indirect usage

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,090
here and we want to have money for each

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,350
document that you are submitting hang on

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,899
give me a break

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,570
so they ended up in court and to make

00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:11,929
the long story short the customer lost

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:14,330
the trial he had to pay 60 million pound

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,690
additionally license cost to the

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,330
software vendor and all the other

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:23,389
customers of this software vendor some

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:27,490
what really nervous because this is a

00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:31,429
real serious cross threat for them now

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:34,340
so this is why I say the mess around

00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:39,580
licensing costs an additional overhead

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:43,519
where you have to take care for and I

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:47,360
found this little shot oh sorry for the

00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:51,230
quality I copied out of a paper the

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,980
voice evie orc asks about 200 large

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:59,269
software vendors in Europe various

00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,610
questions about their on-premise

00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:03,909
software installation and there are

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:07,309
three key figures which I would like to

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:10,010
point out for you so first of all they

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:13,279
were asking or second of all it's the

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:16,100
license model okay roughly 40 percent

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:19,610
saying yeah the license model is okay

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,149
but 55 percent say no sorry the license

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:26,269
model is not okay

00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:29,750
are your contracts okay this is just one

00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:33,919
here thirty two percent saying yes the

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,570
contract is okay but 60 percent disagree

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,750
they are not happy with the contract

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,190
they are not happy with the license fee

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,169
potentially also not happy with the

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,900
service so if they looked at the

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:49,230
satisfaction of the on-premise vendors

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,000
Cisco was basically rated highest the

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,340
customers were quite satisfied with the

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,690
service and products receiving and

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,780
Oracle had the lowest satisfaction rate

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,760
and there is another key figure which I

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,850
would like to point your attention to

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,920
and this is this one over here

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,809
exit plans so due to the fact that

00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,730
you're not really happy with it do you

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:16,500
plan to exit not brexit so they stay in

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:19,350
do you want to change your vendor and

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,970
exit from there only 18 percent say yeah

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:25,890
we want to do that and about 60 70

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,559
percent say no we're not doing that

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:34,170
and do you think why can you imagine why

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:38,610
anybody yeah

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:41,460
subhanAllah kin you know you're having

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,960
this software and software vendor at a

00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,960
certain point in time has you by the

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,670
neck and it's probably a very high

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,080
amount of money that you need to spend a

00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:55,970
lot internally fort to get out of it

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:59,400
right and this is another impact of

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,580
Licensing so what cost nothing is

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:10,200
nothing is definitely wrong to my

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:13,800
understanding so free software has less

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,240
features yeah every project starts small

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,610
we got that in the beginning if you

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,640
think at the first Linux kernel and take

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:23,760
a look how it looked how it is now some

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,809
12 million lines of code later of course

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:31,650
it has grown and here in the opened zoo

00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:35,040
the project we have a kind of anarchy in

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:38,160
terms of features we have what rich

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,460
wants phrased a so called do accuracy

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,500
those who do decide if you think that

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,890
the community can take benefit of this

00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,870
or that feature do it

00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,070
implement it submit it and make it

00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,540
available for everybody

00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:57,420
alright and mostly it's much easier to

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,720
get new features into free software and

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,220
into commercials of

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,850
because of this freedom to act right the

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:10,390
free software is basically about

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:13,030
collaboration get the code modify it

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,430
improve it and give it back so if we're

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,160
working together we're creating a great

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,220
system and that's the point the second

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,620
one is that everybody of us is keen to

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,540
work with open standards because open

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,850
standards allow you as well

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:31,060
to work on top of these standards and to

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,490
gain improvements from them so if we're

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:35,260
talking about digitalization Internet of

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,440
Things or something like that that

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,360
cannot work without free software

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,160
otherwise you're locked into this single

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,580
vendor world where everything works

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,110
nicely in this world but if you look

00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,150
outside if you look over the fence

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,770
you're lost

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,900
Apple is such a great example everything

00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,600
within the ecosystem is nice but if you

00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,730
leave it there or not so the

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,190
interoperability between software

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:04,210
components is key a good example for

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:12,510
this is ease or 26300 does that know

00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:15,550
anybody exactly the open document format

00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:18,270
for office application so this is a

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:22,690
standard it's a worldwide standard and

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:24,760
if you save your stuff in ODF format you

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,150
can make sure or you can be quite sure

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,850
that most software supports this there

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:33,940
is of course one big software vendor

00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,880
which does not support this and why

00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,100
they're using their proprietary

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,640
solutions in order to create a vendor

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:48,240
lock-in and with this solution they are

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:51,790
not even compliant to the GDP our

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,770
general data protection regulations that

00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:56,410
shouldn't for working as we call it in

00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:59,710
German because the Netherlands the Dutch

00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:03,130
government found out that they are

00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,440
submitting between 22 and 25,000

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:10,030
so-called service points to their

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,520
service somewhere in the world of course

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,350
they are not specifying what they are

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,160
they have also not ask you for

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:22,299
permission before so the the law is

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,789
broken a million times each day and what

00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:27,549
scares me most is that nothing is

00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:30,789
happening but if you little grocery

00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:33,190
store around the corner has a wrong page

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,410
on or a wrong sentence on the empress of

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,260
the West website then you can see the

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,780
strong arm of the law getting bitter and

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:45,250
this is this is a serious read I think

00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:47,409
so on the one hand you really have to

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,830
make sure that you're compliant but if

00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:53,470
other companies big companies are

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,100
uncomplaining then basically nothing

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,110
happens so if you want to be sure and

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,240
happy with your applications make sure

00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:05,700
that you use documents in the open

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:09,340
document standard give you a nice

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,950
example about okay yeah less features no

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,130
wrong because we are always able to

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,100
improve to give you a nice example of

00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,860
this kind of collaboration is the so

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,840
called injury surveillance system the

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:28,299
injury surveillance system is recording

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,110
of violent injuries that can be an

00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,020
accident

00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:35,799
robbery self-harm sexual assault or

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:40,419
whatever the whole development is icd-10

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:47,010
encoded icd-10 is an a coding system for

00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:52,870
medical diagnosis all right it is

00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:56,789
geo-referenced with OpenStreetMap so you

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:59,200
can later on identify where you heat

00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:02,620
maps or you can create a heat map and

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,270
find the hot spots for accidents for

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,960
robberies or whatever within your

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:10,059
country this module wasn't development

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,600
by the Ministry of Health and Jamaica

00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:16,210
and it has then been given back to the

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,860
new health community it was built into

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,500
the standard and now everybody can

00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,860
participate from it or take benefit from

00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,650
it

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,080
and I think this is a very positive

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,720
example on

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:35,059
our collaboration with free software is

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:38,710
working so another bomb or is your not

00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:45,380
getting fired for buying IBM Microsoft

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:48,890
OSAP or whatever major company if things

00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,529
are working nobody cares what software

00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,529
it is that you're working with but as

00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:57,919
soon as you have a problem you of course

00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:01,399
more attackable when you have a solution

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,460
which is not in mainstream right and

00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:10,820
mainstream is for example IBM Microsoft

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:14,149
s ap whatever so as strong as a CIO you

00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,450
have to be quite strong in this let's

00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:21,649
say it that way on the other hand you're

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:24,559
not getting fired for buying it's only

00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:26,659
partly true I mean where every everybody

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,659
of us has probably heard already about

00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:32,330
faith software implementations and it

00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:35,450
was a big one last year and what do you

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:38,960
guess how many euros did they burn on a

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:43,360
failed software implementation to 5 10

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,360
20 come on give me a figure

00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:56,029
sorry 700 million does not sound bad any

00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:58,340
any other figure so a German retail

00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:01,010
chain wanted to introduce a standard

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,630
software and they burned 500 million

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:08,539
euros before they stopped the project

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:10,370
and I don't think that in this case you

00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,980
can say you're not getting fired for

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:17,000
buying who is still true so there's

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,750
still some risk but to get the software

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,450
into a company to get free software into

00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,399
a company we have a problem with the

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:29,029
tenders respectively with the call for

00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:31,159
information because these are two

00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:33,770
completely different mechanics how a

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,090
software gets into a company it's push

00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,549
versus pull

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,450
if you have a commercial company then

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:42,200
the software is pushed into the company

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,799
who needs it

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,289
so are we want a new CRM system so what

00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,840
are requirements yeah let's take a look

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:53,629
at Gartner fourth quadrant who's in

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,450
there yeah we write to them and wait

00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:57,970
that the information comes back home

00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,529
free software doesn't work like that

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:03,679
for free software you have to become

00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:07,039
active by yourself because free software

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:12,909
is pulled into the company right there

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:15,950
is mostly no project office that is

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:18,889
receiving any calls for information and

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,429
saying hey you Sugar CRM can you please

00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:25,100
describe what our what are your answers

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:27,139
to our questions no that doesn't work

00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,929
that way all right you need to become

00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:33,110
active to bring the software into your

00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:36,139
company or into this company other thing

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,059
is that free software projects will

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:40,309
probably not invite you for a decision

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,009
meeting in a nice hotel in Hawaii or

00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:44,110
somewhere else but that's a different

00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:47,539
story

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:51,619
so the fat you're not getting fired for

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:56,960
buying IBM or whatever this is partly

00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:58,490
true yes this is a set if you're without

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,259
the mainstream you're always getting

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,049
more attackable and if you look at the

00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:07,610
c-level CIO CEO it's quite a political

00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:11,720
thing yeah finally we have the questions

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:13,639
about the risk because s CIO you're

00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,679
responsible basically to keep the system

00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,220
running and to make sure that your

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,869
business can work with it so if

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:25,159
everything works nobody cares if

00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:27,169
something goes off if something goes

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:31,190
wrong it even if it's breaks where do

00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:33,429
you put the risk so first of all you

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,929
need to select your support partner in

00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:38,470
the free software world we have many

00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:41,510
companies that are providing support for

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,669
legacy or for proprietary applications

00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,530
just mostly only one company and even if

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:47,790
you pay a shitload amount of money to

00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,470
them it doesn't unnecessary

00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:52,470
that you receive a very good service

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,240
quality alright so now you have the

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,480
freedom to choose your support partner

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,540
then finally you need to agree on SLA

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,500
service level agreements it's something

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,390
different whether you have support

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:11,000
weekly from 9:00 to 5:00 by phone or

00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:16,050
whether you have a seven days 24/7

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,530
support by telephone by internet and

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:23,310
maybe by direct consultancy that your

00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:25,560
SLA s I have mostly at all they have

00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,500
always a direct impact on the price that

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,380
you pay for the service

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:33,900
finally train the people I mean if you

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,510
have all the service outsourced that

00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,360
looks good on the first lens but if you

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,910
look behind it you just have drained the

00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,160
outsourcing part 9 after 3 months if the

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,140
stuff has completely changed so the

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,170
know-how is gone so you start again

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,370
right so they are losing they're solving

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,930
a problem somewhere in abroad I call it

00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,760
you get a solution back you look at it

00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,680
and say come on that cannot be true so

00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,890
you start investigating by yourself and

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,900
do basically the same investigation two

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:07,200
times one was the external partner one

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,390
with yourself and I mean I've seen this

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,990
a couple of times with outsource service

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,550
contracts it's mostly not ideal but it

00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:18,630
looks good in terms of management

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:20,400
figures so finally make sure that you're

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,950
properly partner with your free software

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,930
project because then you can directly

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,160
influence the product quality and make

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,460
sure that the patch that you've

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:34,350
developed for this problem ends up in

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:37,320
the next release all right so free

00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,360
software is a shift basically from a

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,160
vendor oriented approach to make sure

00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,470
the vendor gets enough money to a

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,600
customer centric approach you as a

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,940
community member can use your power to

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:52,070
improve the software and the service and

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:55,730
with this finally your operation

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,290
so the question ordered that the risk

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,760
with free software isn't my

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,760
understanding no issue

00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,990
so let's summarize up a little bit or

00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,570
let's start a summary with an estimate

00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:15,960
from from Gartner they said in 2011

00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,820
well 2016 open-source software will be

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,540
included in mission critical software

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:24,870
portfolios within 99 percent of the

00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,240
global 2000 enterprises now think

00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,250
they're right the reason for this is

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,860
quite high software quality we have a

00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,500
control development and finally you have

00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:37,200
the freedom to choose the freedom to

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,760
improve to make sure that you get the

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:45,750
right software partner and the right

00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:48,660
conditions for your company some big

00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:52,020
users of free software for example are

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:54,210
aquella since many many years they are

00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,300
running their retail system on on a

00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:00,450
Linux basis of course all the big ones

00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,280
Google Facebook Amazon are using free

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,750
software and take advantage from it

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,910
partly they're feeding back into the

00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,950
community hardly not ACP has a new

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:14,610
software release which is called Hana

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:18,000
and this Hana runs I will not say

00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:21,540
exclusively but for a very large part on

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,830
Zuzu Linux Enterprise alright so if

00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,560
you're now getting an on-premise

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:28,280
installation it's for the most part is

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,460
ously software running underneath and

00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:35,490
it's already set Microsoft makes making

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,450
use of free software for himself quite a

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:41,880
lot because otherwise their error

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,650
software would not work and you think or

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,090
do you know what I think that the

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:52,430
coolest gadgets is that is running Linux

00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:52,430
any idea any proposal

00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,250
sorry Esther's take the microphone I'm

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:06,140
hearing badly car breaking machines that

00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,710
run on Linux somewhat I think this one

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,470
here

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,170
the Tesla they're using Linux internally

00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:17,270
as well I think this is probably the

00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:22,060
coolest gadget so to make the long story

00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:25,099
short to sum up there is a lot of wrong

00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,829
wrong words about free software in the

00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:30,770
market and all of them are basically

00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:32,420
wrong there is only one really one

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,970
mistake that you can make with free

00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:40,040
software and this is basically not to

00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:43,820
use it and that's for today thank you

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:53,579
very much I'm happy to answer questions

00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:53,579
[Applause]

00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:03,269
thanks coincidentally coincidentally I

00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:08,400
have the same foot towards proprietary

00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:12,029
software besides some other issues have

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,799
you compared that because I mean we can

00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:16,380
argue in the same way we can say that

00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:18,900
hey there is some geek programming this

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,240
proprietary software you don't see the

00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,069
people and you don't see their code that

00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:28,339
doesn't change anything about the people

00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:32,490
behind the project so if we compare this

00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,259
can you find out something and then tell

00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,980
people well actually if you have those

00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:37,589
peers

00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,200
those are exactly the fears you should

00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:45,150
have towards proprietary software plus

00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:48,420
more yet is a good question actually I

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,369
haven't compared that to me odd to check

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,799
against what are the fears against

00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:56,489
proprietary oh yeah the fears against

00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:59,099
proprietary solution because I figured

00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:01,559
out or unnoticed every now and then the

00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:03,809
more license fees the customers are

00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:08,460
paying the more happy they seem to be

00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:12,349
even though they don't really get a good

00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,359
get a good service back for this this is

00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:17,430
strange but I couldn't really found I

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:23,150
find out what the what the reason for

00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:31,200
this is does it answer your question

00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:32,270
Thanks any more questions ok thanks a

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,800
lot

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:38,419
have a good way back

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,419
