You should not believe everything that Big Money tells you.....

Everyone knows that Free Software such as Linux, Apache or PostgreSQL are the backbone of many data centers (DC) and cloud offerings. The Internet as we know it today would not exist without Free & OpenSource Software (FOSS)
But the more Free Software leaves the DC and gets closer to the 'Enduser', the more myth are build around FOSS. 
Linux on a Desktop? GIMP Instead of Photoshop? Running your business on a Free ERP-System? Fear, Uncertainty and Doubts (FUD) are spread to protect market share for proprietary solutions.
In this talk I will take a look at some FUD, and share some thoughts about answers to the myths.
