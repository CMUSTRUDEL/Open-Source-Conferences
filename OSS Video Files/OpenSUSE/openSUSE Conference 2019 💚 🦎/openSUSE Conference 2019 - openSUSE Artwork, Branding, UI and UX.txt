What's wrong and what could be better

openSUSE's brand image and software have been evolving for a long time, and in that time a lot of stuff was defined. There is YaST, there is geeko, both are industry standard, both function as a way to differentiate the distribution. However not everything that is openSUSE is great, in many cases, there are some serious omissions in terms of how openSUSE is sold through the eyes of potential users. This talk would function as a way to highlight some of the issues that will require further development in upcoming years, to support future devices, use cases for the distribution, ease of use, as well what we should improve in terms of presentation of the brand itself.
