What's wrong and what could be better

openSUSE's brand image and software have been evolving for a long time, and in that time a lot of stuff was defined. There is YaST, there is geeko, both are industry standard, both function as a way to differentiate the distribution. However not everything that is openSUSE is great, in many cases, there are some serious omissions in terms of how openSUSE is sold through the eyes of potential users. This talk would function as a way to highlight some of the issues that will require further development in upcoming years, to support future devices, use cases for the distribution, ease of use, as well what we should improve in terms of presentation of the brand itself.

all right hello I'm LCP or static as you

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,130
can see and

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,060
I will be talking about artwork and

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:27,849
branding and uint wax of openSUSE over

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:31,810
the the last two years basically and I

00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:35,410
think I should start from inviting you

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,920
to join the team because we are missing

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:41,739
a lot of people it would be great if

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,200
that team was larger and I would be glad

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:52,480
to see some people joining the team

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,900
because we are doing great things and to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,600
the extent of us doing great things it's

00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:02,760
important to remember that we don't

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:10,630
really take feedback through Twitter but

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:12,430
it still helps us to to get some well

00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,280
some feedback some feedback through

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:21,640
Twitter is nice but but there are better

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:26,890
channels to to to show to to request

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:34,920
some some features and I mean we also do

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:40,330
memes when we have some free time so I

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:43,690
mean I welcome you to to join us from

00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:51,250
the stuff that we have done this is very

00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:54,340
short list but I mean we did yes icons

00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,960
which you might have seen in in leaping

00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:02,430
in tumbleweed we done we have done

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:09,340
branding for the distributions over the

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:12,599
last two years and there is so much

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,040
model we have done but I feel like

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,269
contributions that that really matter

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,390
are the ones that are not really visible

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,549
to everybody because you you get to

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,189
appreciate them despite the fact that

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,590
that you don't really know who made them

00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:37,629
it was the team

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:40,480
that was that was us and well from my mm

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:47,440
maybe a little bit more personal point

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:56,769
of view we have some things to discuss

00:02:47,440 --> 00:03:02,040
and those things are logos our colors

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:06,269
are things that people associate with

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:10,989
with openSUSE and things that maybe

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:17,170
aren't exactly the thing that that they

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:22,599
should be maybe we should try to make

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:25,680
them a little bit more accessible a

00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:29,400
little bit more interesting a little bit

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,819
different from for example so the logo

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,829
which is which is exactly the same as

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:42,609
openSUSE logo with exception of of

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:48,940
cut-off feet so currently we share the

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:54,900
same logo and it's it's probably not the

00:03:48,940 --> 00:04:01,680
best idea that that we do because well

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:05,109
our branding is is very very much

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,739
similar to what the word Sousa folks are

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:12,190
doing and it doesn't help us to have our

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:18,789
own identity it doesn't help us to have

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:24,250
our own marketing maybe it's it's it's

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:29,440
very much disassociates us from being

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,090
separate and we should maybe from the

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,720
point of view of actually being

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,610
different entities and well we named

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,169
ourselves different entities despite the

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,020
fact that we are basically the same but

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:45,639
we are trying to be separate from the

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,740
from the from souza

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:53,539
and obviously there is the point of

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,569
Wikipedia having rank logo which has

00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:59,030
filled out I with white which looks

00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:02,509
terrible on on any other background and

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,879
white and I can change that because I

00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:07,879
don't have access and nobody has access

00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,069
because the guy that changed it stops

00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:15,080
contributing to Wikipedia end and then

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:18,020
just just I can change it nobody can

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,099
change it it seems so so maybe we can

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,500
change logo for that reason

00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:28,270
all right there is also topic of

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,159
distribution logos and here probably

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,789
tumbleweed is the biggest biggest issue

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:37,969
because it's so wide that next to next

00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:42,169
to lip it's really hard to make it work

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:43,370
as in it doesn't look like like the

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,830
logos belong together

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,740
which is an issue and you are trying to

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,400
present them next to each other

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:57,909
they appear to be in in different styles

00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:02,630
and well that that might be some

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:04,719
something that that needs to be iterated

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,759
upon may be changed in the future

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:12,620
something that that needs to needs to

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,560
change and there are colors and colors

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,889
are you know you know our colors they're

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:23,389
they're visible on the on the slide

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:28,610
there is that blue green and as a hint

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:34,279
of of the CN on the bottom distribution

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:36,770
logos use green for at least one one

00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:39,139
distribution logo uses green for forest

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,900
color which makes it look next to

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,150
openSUSE logo as default distribution

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,509
which is an issue when you are trying to

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:52,210
present a tumbleweed and leap as as

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:55,760
things that are equal to one another

00:06:52,210 --> 00:07:00,170
maybe that that also requires some

00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,200
some thoughts from from us and there is

00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,830
a very limited palette so there is

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:11,210
basically I ordered added red and yellow

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:15,350
the last year I think and it's still

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:18,740
barely enough to to actually create

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,230
artwork that would be in in line with

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:24,710
with what we want out of openSUSE as in

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,860
brand and from what we actually can do

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:34,160
because there is a limit to to the

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:36,890
colors and and stuff this far there were

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,900
few ideas that appeared in in different

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:48,710
places they are very simplistic and and

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:53,200
would probably help to show the we would

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,410
allow to easy easier show the brand

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,780
compared to current current ways it it

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,230
it's an interesting idea I don't know if

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:07,520
anybody likes it so so that will maybe

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:09,800
require some some discussion obviously

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,550
you can also see that lip here is yellow

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,660
instead of green which is which i think

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:22,100
is a great color yellow is great and and

00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,700
certainly isn't green which makes it

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,010
look less default than it currently is

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,770
currently appears to be and that logo

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,990
was a happy accident that second one was

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:37,040
a happy accident of going through

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:41,240
various stages of previous logo and then

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:44,180
creating stuff that that just kind of

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,630
worked there are obviously on the left

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,900
there

00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:54,980
there is depressed and and and very

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:58,640
happy eco and there is also pokeball

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,130
Geeko there there are a lot of weird e

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,910
acid that came through from from dead

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:07,250
and there there were some ideas for

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,410
variants because current logo

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:16,310
has very strict guidelines as to what

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:19,970
colors can be used in with it and I feel

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,670
like maybe we could create some some

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,540
more interesting stuff out of this There

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,940
is obviously Fedora lago chico and

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,450
thread hat lago chico just just because

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,450
I could

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,580
that they're they're different variants

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,560
there they are

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:45,590
Fido dog they're great they are daring

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:48,460
and I think it's a better idea than

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,660
having Kiko always be green because

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,150
communities won't want to express

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,470
themselves in a way which which would

00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:00,350
show so better who they are so they're

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,480
for example community community logos

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,300
proposals for four different countries

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,880
on the bottom there for Poland Ukraine

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:14,089
and Italy for some reason I don't know

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,990
so feedback about that there is an open

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:20,690
issue on branding repo and I would

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,230
really love more feedback about all the

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,010
all those things because I I mean it

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:31,520
will it it if that goes to it will

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,680
represent the whole the whole community

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,070
and I would love to hear what you think

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,750
I can't do I can do this alone I just

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:44,500
can't

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:48,100
so there are more issues related to

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,930
present to presenting the brand from

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,770
desktop side of things because you know

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:57,110
we have wallpapers we have some in some

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,320
splash screens for different software

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,880
and it appears well it appeared before

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,040
the presentation as xfc was holding

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,110
there are those simple things that that

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,940
maybe maybe our ignore but are very

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,280
important from from my point of view

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:19,700
from where I'm standing and maybe maybe

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,650
currently we are thinking too modern we

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,040
are a little bit too far

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:31,540
in advance - what openSUSE truly truly

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:35,720
is we have green and we have very

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,420
specifically chameleon chameleon as as

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,150
the as the logo maybe we could do

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:45,710
something more natural maybe something

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:49,250
more I don't know something that isn't

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:56,210
sir isn't as modern as what we currently

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:58,940
do with architecture and with we for red

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:03,710
light bulbs and stuff like that maybe

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:07,400
there is a place where men at your

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,190
finger with the things we currently have

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:14,990
which is green blue and and stuff like

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:18,410
that there is also an issue of

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:24,350
merchandise and it's a it's a topic

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:28,250
certainly we tend to focus heavily on

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:32,540
logos which is fine when you are trying

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:36,790
to to maybe spread awareness of the logo

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:40,640
but I think that maybe we should try to

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:45,200
be a little more creative try to be a

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,740
little more interesting with with how we

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,990
present the brand outside of well

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:55,700
observe outside of conferences of side

00:12:50,990 --> 00:13:00,020
of of websites etc we want people to go

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:02,150
up to two other people and ask wow what

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,279
a nice t-shirts were degraded and you

00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,339
can explain all the things you stopped

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:10,060
and Sue's and etc if you if you solve

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,920
desire if you don't then you go and

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,990
don't tell them anything and just say

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,300
that it's a great t-shirt and and I like

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:23,980
it there is all right maybe you works

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:28,040
part of part of part of things there is

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:30,260
obviously that's that's a list it's not

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,860
a complete list but but it's certainly

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,860
about yes

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:49,050
and well I mean if you ask just guys

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:52,620
about this it's very clear that they

00:13:49,050 --> 00:14:01,310
would like to change that but it's not

00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:07,950
likely they would like to change that so

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:11,450
maybe maybe start off here but maybe not

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:15,420
start from here maybe start from

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:19,589
actually creating mock-ups of things

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:22,920
that should happen in yust and then when

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:25,170
we we are ready to to have some we when

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:31,620
we have some idea of what we exactly

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:34,709
need we should we should start writing

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:39,720
all that stuff in meanwhile VI and Lib

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:43,620
Lib why I can and then write other stuff

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,770
in NASCAR and etc and and all this stuff

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,970
needs to go through stages to actually

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:54,600
be developed into something that can

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:57,529
happen can be a thing in the in the

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,990
future so if you are interested

00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:05,700
currently we don't have any place to

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:07,950
really put that stuff but I was thinking

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:12,270
about teleport and and creating some

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,959
issues about about specific parts of us

00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,940
and and then we have some mock-ups for

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:21,540
for installer but we certainly don't

00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,690
have mock-ups for the rest 70 other

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:28,230
modules that exist in yes and I doubt we

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:31,199
will be finished with that till the till

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:36,510
the I don't know next year because it's

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:39,360
a lot of stuff to do actually so from

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:43,170
this point of view if you if you are

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,160
interested let us know we are on discord

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:51,130
matrix IRC Oh

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:54,640
artwork everywhere just let us know

00:15:51,130 --> 00:16:04,490
hmm and then there is landing page and

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:08,630
oh boy what a joy I mean I I like the

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:11,800
design it's great but I don't think that

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:17,810
that content is necessarily what we

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:26,000
should have there because we are looking

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:30,170
at a very very very distribution focused

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,650
design which opens openSUSE more than

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:40,160
being a distribution is a community of

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:43,790
people so if we're community it would be

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:49,490
nice to actually mention that we are a

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:53,060
community somewhere on the page so maybe

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:56,600
maybe instead of having all this maybe

00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,450
we should use software openSUSE doc to

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,820
actually show that we have distributions

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,339
and maybe on the main page just

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,660
mentioned that hey you can go download

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:11,990
them here redirect to this page maybe

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,449
it's a better idea there is a lot of the

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,990
duplication of the things that we are

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,790
trying to sell between two sides and

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,160
navigation structure is terrible on on

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,620
the main page because it redirects to

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,280
only the stuff that is on the page

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,770
itself and I don't think that I can

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,770
scroll I don't really need to to have

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,020
those things show up I would like to see

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,740
things that actually redirect me to

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,130
something that isn't on the page that is

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,690
related to how openSUSE operates and how

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:52,100
it works but not necessarily what is

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:56,920
directly within the page mmm then we

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,920
have list of tools which is

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,850
well it's it's not a long list that's

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,070
for sure I'm certain that we are

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:10,170
actually doing more stuff than than for

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:13,440
things and maybe wiki isn't the best

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:16,020
place to put them all there is certainly

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,970
not enough space on on the screen too

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,220
but I think that having few categories

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,260
about about the the things that we do is

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,660
great but maybe mention everything that

00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,299
we actually do because that stuff is

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,890
useful and and we are proud of it as a

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:39,240
community maybe we could have those

00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:44,070
mentioned on the main page then oh yeah

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,429
I mentioned all that and news are great

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:51,179
I would say that the news certainly

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:53,580
deserve to be on the on the on the main

00:18:51,179 --> 00:19:03,510
page I am glad they they are already

00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:05,910
there so from from this we do have stuff

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:09,120
that that we know we built on the page

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,919
but what is missing is certainly focus

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,210
on the community focus on the ways to

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:19,950
contribute focus on developed projects

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:24,390
all of that is is really really missing

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:27,210
from from the from the main page and

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:31,470
then there is software not opposite to

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:33,090
the torque which which well is missing a

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,770
lot of stuff about distributions as well

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,380
even though it is focused about

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,570
distributions around distributions all

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:43,490
that stuff is basically on wiki's and

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:48,660
it's hard to find and it's kind of maybe

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:52,940
not that well executed in many cases

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:55,500
maybe we should try to strive for better

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,049
explanation of our own distributions

00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,380
maybe we should sell them better maybe

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,220
we have something that that differential

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,020
differentiates us from different

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,970
distributions I don't know it's not

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,660
written there

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:12,180
so yeah that's this basically

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,130
it I don't have anything else prepared I

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,310
have a nice screen and that's it

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,310
thank you

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,600
so now is the part where you ask me

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:35,420
questions I don't know if I will have

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:44,290
answers but I will try to answer you if

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:49,810
you have any questions so if you want to

00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:49,810
change the logo to have more clear

00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:03,530
separate entity from Sousa what about

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:05,990
the name so historically speaking the

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,570
the logo itself is based on an old Suzy

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,130
logo they changed the Suzy logo and they

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,930
didn't help but update the open Suzy

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,650
logo I just created a disparity between

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:18,110
the two and it only makes things worse

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,750
it's not really I mean the change of the

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:24,050
logo was basically only cutting off legs

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,140
and that's it yeah mainly you're right

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,600
mainly but not exactly that's not

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,890
exactly the truth but it's close its

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,780
close enough from a normal man's

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,790
perspective that's what they see but the

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,460
fact that matter is is that when that

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,580
happened that just weakened both brands

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,560
in my opinion yes of course um the idea

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,090
of creating a different logo in fact I

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,830
really like that work that you did I saw

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,170
it's been around for a while and it's

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:51,140
been not it's really good um I agree

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:53,810
with this young man saying that if you

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,100
want separation then go separation so as

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,310
long as we try to keep them close

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:01,910
similar but different there's going to

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:03,260
be a lot of constraints on that and it's

00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,730
going to be really hard to push through

00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,460
and this usually has a vested interest

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,910
in it as well then I change I hope so

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:15,440
that goes away I I mean I'm bound to to

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:18,110
the to the last part of the parenthesis

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm bout to that I I'm not talking about

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,850
that because I know that's way more

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:29,060
controversial than the logo itself so I

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:30,929
I will I will ignore it so let's go back

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,009
to yes

00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,899
because you mentioned the partitioner

00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:36,820
for instance yeah and that's one thing

00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:39,940
so here's the interesting part of yost

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,450
is that it's the one place where susan

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,609
openSUSE are directly connected because

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,749
Souza's certainly has a very long list

00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:51,039
of features of required functionality

00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:54,059
lalalalala from product management that

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,739
is really historically grown and

00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,450
probably not that transparent so not

00:22:56,739 --> 00:23:00,429
everybody knows exactly why every

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,840
feature is in yes that's there the

00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:04,629
partitioner is something that we haven't

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,330
touched because of the complexity and

00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:11,230
because of that those kind of issues it

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:14,830
I was told that the reason why partition

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,499
looks like it does is because nobody

00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,299
cares to change it it's too complex to

00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:24,850
change its peak it was based on some

00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:27,700
stuff and building on top of this old

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,200
old thing is just making it worse the

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,639
fact the matter is is that you have you

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,029
asked and the partitioner is a separate

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:34,450
thing

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:36,820
so the partitioner itself in encode is a

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:41,139
separate thing and it uses a different

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:44,159
QT it's oh no that's this packager which

00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:46,869
which does it partitioner itself

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,789
partitioner itself is a module that is

00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:53,710
directly bound to Korea's right and

00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:56,739
packager is a separate module that that

00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,489
is built on top of into action stuff too

00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:03,070
yeah so I mean partition there shouldn't

00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:06,129
be as hard to change package package

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,299
manager' package management I won't talk

00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:12,480
about because I know it's for yes folks

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:15,369
a controversial topic it's a big country

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,080
already realistically speaking though

00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:19,210
the package manager would be an easier

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,690
thing to change from understanding users

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,720
needs

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:28,570
then the partitioner would be yes yes of

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,970
course I mean the the first thing that

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,149
that partitioner said certainly needs is

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,220
a menu bar because it's a lot of lost

00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:38,470
modules need that it's a feature that

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,549
that needs to be somewhere in the code

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,000
it is in the code but only for QT and

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,460
only

00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,090
for our Wizard dialogues which which is

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:53,250
installer and one-click install which

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:57,040
wouldn't excess for position there so

00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:03,250
I'm not trying sir the last point on the

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:07,060
ass thing was go back to the snack

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:09,970
forgot now what I was gonna say ah the

00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:12,520
idea of trading mock-ups so he asked in

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,370
and of itself the way it works being

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,710
built on an old QT with River you can't

00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,780
just do whatever you want yes I know

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,680
that's why I said that that all the

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:29,170
stuff would need to first go through my

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:32,410
UI and then go to to the yes yes

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:36,040
bindings and then go to other things and

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,620
it's a complicated process but creating

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,890
stuff that is reusable and that that

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,740
will will be will be able to reuse in

00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:47,020
multiple places will make it much better

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,390
which is which is why mock-ups makes

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,270
sense because because we can then just

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:54,730
look what we can simplify in multiple

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:58,960
modules and and have it all make sense

00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:02,170
maybe again assuming that you have a

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,890
fold and clear picture of all this yeah

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:10,080
this is a full and clear picture of

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,080
requirements yes and that will be hard

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,430
so just wanna ask so is this would you

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,990
say this is a big dream of yours like

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,050
it's good that you've done a lot of my

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,610
own explorations of the logo is it more

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,630
like something you doing on the side or

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,450
is it something you really want to

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,310
action and push within the company I

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:33,820
mean it was in discussions with the

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:37,390
board certainly it's not like I'm hiding

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:42,480
that it's it's publicly shall shows up

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:45,490
in multiple places and I doubt anybody

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,460
haven't seen that obviously somebody

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:52,360
here want one have seen that but but I

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:55,580
hope that this is the this this practice

00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,110
and and gets very popular

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,900
so I can get it easier into into the the

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,640
distribution end and what would you say

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,809
your number one blocker is what is

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,809
stopping you from getting to the next

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,670
that's a good question that's a good

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,460
question I have no idea to be honest

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,240
because I think the beers blogger is

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,110
myself

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,330
because I I keep I keep changing stuff

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,040
and I keep adding adding stuff and at

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,929
some point when I stopped doing that I

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,100
will have clearer picture that I want

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:34,490
this and that and I doubt it will happen

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,190
soon okay do you do you have a chief of

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,260
marketing officer huh do you have a

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,360
chief of marketing officer that you

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,030
could collaborate with I mean not so

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:49,670
much on the on the visuals were more an

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:52,130
idea like I mean I don't really have

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,380
have a contact direct direct contact

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:58,240
with anybody like that but that would be

00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:01,250
an interesting collaboration sure okay

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,140
but I there from your presentation it

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,600
sounds like you're the guy to drive this

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,309
thank you

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,620
absolutely yeah I'm have you convinced

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:13,450
me I haven't seen anybody else that that

00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,450
would be crazy enough to change that

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:22,760
[Applause]

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,730
thank you

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,360
so about the landing page I asked with

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:33,450
Christian and he and Braun decides that

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,160
the landing page is now not controlled

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,890
by open source our communities control

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,390
device user so we cannot end up with 20

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,429
dead

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,980
that's actually first off I'm the head

00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:46,890
of the UI UX team it's Susan just for

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:51,120
transparency um it is not controlled by

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,980
ins by us I promise you we don't want to

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,410
control it the fact the matter is is

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,090
that whenever things are needed we end

00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:02,640
up having to do it because no one else

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:04,830
will and logistically speaking it's it's

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,520
it's sitting in a data center in a

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:10,440
server room where Souza and openSUSE

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,400
don't really have that much access so

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,630
you know it's control it's hard to

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,490
understand

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,410
so it might be interesting to understand

00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:24,510
the history of that page historically it

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,280
became what it became back a long time

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,630
ago we came along and there was a

00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,400
request to change things we took with

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,679
let's say limited information which is

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,410
always the case at Sousa or openSUSE

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:43,380
with limited information we tried to

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:46,140
create a more marketing like ish page to

00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,169
sell openSUSE in the Internet's right

00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,020
that was the concept of that um when

00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:53,669
requirements change if there there are

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,140
many ideas of what could be on that page

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,809
there are many ideas of how to present

00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,900
it originally our assumptions software

00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:02,280
is software and the marketing page is

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,110
the marketing page the software is where

00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,820
you go find your packages the marketing

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,770
pages the marketing page you can change

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,020
that you can do it differently there's

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:14,090
no there's no law that says that we

00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:16,679
don't define it as such but again

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,900
understanding requirements is the first

00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,820
step and and understanding that like

00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,340
really like ask the whole community get

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,799
a good idea have someone with a

00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,450
marketing concept you know create all

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,240
this information first before you start

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,650
changing things that's my suggestion and

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,870
don't ever write code that you don't

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:37,919
want to maintain yourself that's what

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:40,320
I've learned and one more thing is about

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,040
the phone so now we have open science on

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,350
almost every pages I think yeah it's a

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,929
good phone but people are just getting

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,059
bored that's responsive every page use

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,920
the same phone if we want to be kind of

00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:56,030
fun

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,890
let users remember us yeah I mean maybe

00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:00,200
we really introduced if anybody wants to

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,240
create a font I'm not the guy certainly

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,440
I can I mean not create advance maybe

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:10,700
choose a little more special I'm not I'm

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:14,600
not bored yet maybe okay but if anybody

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:24,170
has better ideas I'm very very happy to

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:26,360
oblige once you have a good idea of what

00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,740
you want your logo to look like it is

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,680
then much easier to come up with a

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,870
special font that sits alongside and

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:39,680
matches that logo well that can be used

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:40,790
in special places so yeah sorry the one

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,380
thing you have they take into

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,750
consideration with fonts is glyph

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,630
coverage language coverage um it's

00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:50,270
really really really I'm looking at

00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,650
really hard to make a font it's

00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,960
literally something that you can do your

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,940
whole life and then just get good at um

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,440
and you can spend many many years with

00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,900
many many people making fonts so

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,750
creating your own font is probably maybe

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:05,000
a bit beyond scope I would assume people

00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:08,450
have tried and failed on picking the

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,280
best font for the most people is I think

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,000
what the decisions were based on until

00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,250
now I'm I mean that's the reason why we

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,800
don't use fifth light anymore because

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:21,200
because coverage was very poor and even

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,110
in Polish there wasn't really really a

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:29,870
way to display anything outside of very

00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:33,110
limited set of of stuff so I'm in

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:36,110
agreement that the logo needs to change

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:40,820
and I actually like your mock-ups I like

00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:45,290
them a lot the question I have is Souza

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:51,530
and openSUSE have a strong symbiotic

00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:54,230
relationship right and we need to ensure

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:57,890
that that relationship continues and we

00:32:54,230 --> 00:33:02,660
also need to advertise in one shape or

00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:05,389
another that relationship I mean example

00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,019
of red cotton Fedora comes to mind

00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:10,669
it's not like that's the salt

00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:13,039
disassociated entirely but I think that

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:15,109
and and it's completely different colors

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:21,079
the completely different stuff except

00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:24,349
for obviously hat and Fedora so I like I

00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:27,259
like the fact that it's still a Jimmy

00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:29,629
chameleon for me as long as it's a

00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:31,339
chameleon there's an obvious association

00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:32,839
in chameleons or wonderful creatures

00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:36,109
that can be many weird different colors

00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:38,409
so I think as long as it's recognizable

00:33:36,109 --> 00:33:42,349
of some form of the same kind of animal

00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:44,779
we have that cross representation still

00:33:42,349 --> 00:34:06,889
and for me that's kind of enough let's

00:33:44,779 --> 00:34:10,730
make it pink then being close branding

00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:12,859
wise but yet separate is was a big

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,509
mistake if you ask me so historically

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:16,819
speaking that was a mistake tacking and

00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:19,039
open on to everything because we're

00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:21,649
trying to sell our open source Ness was

00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,990
historically a bad decision and should

00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:26,650
be changed but you need again a strategy

00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:29,349
and understand hashtag blame novo

00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:34,789
[Laughter]

00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:36,259
yeah me neither yeah just to kind of

00:34:34,789 --> 00:34:37,879
follow up with Ken thinking I know you

00:34:36,259 --> 00:34:41,210
wanted a skip over the name thing but

00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:42,200
like with the logo idea with also

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,819
something the board is going to be

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,899
talking about at one o'clock in the main

00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:49,789
hall for the the big board meeting today

00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,960
yeah I do think maybe that needs to come

00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:53,210
up with it and what what I like with

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,220
your ideas is yeah like if we keep it to

00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,599
the chameleon like you know like with

00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,119
Fedora right hat you know there's you

00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:03,140
know room for visual similarities but
