Description:

Or how are SUSE and the openSUSE community interacting together in 2019

Presenter: Thomas Di Giacomo

In this session we will first briefly describe how the openSUSE community and SUSE have been historically (well since Leap/Tumbleweed, not going back to the days before) collaborating together, e.g. Gnome and SUSE Linux Desktop, KDE and packagehub, then look at some of the more recent activities around MicroOS, container engines and tools, container networking such as Cilium, container management, etc. with respect to Kubic and SUSE CaaS Platform.

As this is not only about a company and a community per se but a lot more primarily about people doing things, about contributors and developers, weâ€™ll highlight a few specific example individuals in such a collaboration context, , and then share what we think are the aspects that work and ones where we could improve for both to benefit from.

get started I want to thank Thomas

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,790
DiGiacomo president of engineering

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,680
product and product and innovation for

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,510
Sousa coming here and giving his talk

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,350
he's gonna have to leave quickly after

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,300
the after his talk so try to keep the

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,359
questions to a limit if it gets into

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:35,309
questions so here's Thomas thanks thanks

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:36,510
doc hey good morning everyone it's good

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,510
to see that you have so much energy

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,040
early in the morning but you will need a

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,850
lot of energy for the coming two three

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,250
days thanks for coming to OSC and we're

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,950
always very happy and excited to see the

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,430
community coming together so and I want

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,860
to thanks Doug and and everybody will

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,289
help and make that happen it's a lot of

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,460
work for people and they're already

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,130
doing a great job thanks

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:10,229
[Applause]

00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:12,820
so i'm thomas i'm susie on prey and

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,610
working with engineers with project

00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,700
managers and i'm very hung out to be

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,340
here as well so i will try not to talk

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,759
too much about Sousa but I have to talk

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:29,259
about a little bit so yeah we are

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,600
actually independent since March 15th so

00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,300
we had a lot of parties and cakes around

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,250
the world you cannot really see that but

00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,789
it's in Beijing this was a Beijing

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,460
office

00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:41,860
the cake is was huge so there was food

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,600
for maybe two weeks for 50 people in in

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,789
a single cake and some people say well

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,640
you're not really independent you're

00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:54,310
owned by a private equity and so that's

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,570
not being independence and yes we are

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,490
more independent than in the past

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,009
because we are not under the micro focus

00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,170
group anymore that means we have suzhou

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,320
at sharp people we have Suzhou finance

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,539
people we already had sushi dedicated

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,459
engineer's sales product and marketing

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,660
and all of that but now we are getting

00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:15,820
all the functions under the green flag

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,070
except for IT for now so we are still

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,959
relying on microfocus IT for another 12

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,620
to 18 months

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,420
but we will move to a Suzhou IT stack in

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,980
the future as well and we hope to make

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,200
it more green than it was in the past

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,110
more based on open source obviously as

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,090
much as we can so we're working on that

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,170
and I'm sure they are probably people in

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,260
the room that are involved in does it

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,570
scale of discussions I wanted to give a

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:45,400
few numbers as well so Suzy today we are

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:48,280
about 1800 people who make about 400

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,010
millions of revenues per year and the

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,630
plan is to be in five years around 3,000

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:58,060
people and around 800 million revenues

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,720
agency in 2016 and the company was six

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:05,410
hundred people so we are growing we were

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,140
welcoming more and more people in the

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,320
company and with that we realized that

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:16,660
all the good culture the open source DNA

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,230
that Sousa has we need to bring that to

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,450
the new people coming to us as

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,390
and sometimes they come already with an

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,269
open-source background but we decided to

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,709
write an open-source policy so after 26

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,659
years without having an open source

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,879
policy we worked on an open source

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,159
policy back in September last year

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,250
it's mentioning a lot of the openSUSE

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,269
stuff it's actually does a link in the

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,970
Susy open-source policy to openSUSE

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:47,329
website as well we joined the open chain

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,420
compliance to make sure that we were

00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:53,420
delivering as a company software in an

00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:57,980
open source compliant way as well so

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:59,840
we've done some of that to also help new

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,459
people when they join us to understand

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,890
how we do our things now as you know we

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,079
are contributing to a lot of upstream

00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,730
projects our linux open stacks there

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,739
fall of that I just wanted to highlight

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,070
a couple of examples there are of some

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:18,979
of maybe smaller projects but that we

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,930
pushed upstream so on the left you have

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:26,330
open attic it's Storage Manager open

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,840
source solution it was open source but

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,780
we pushed that to safe upstream so it's

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,150
now part of safe upstream the other

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,090
example is Stratos Stratos is a user

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,400
interface for Cloud Foundry we got that

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,160
software from HPE it was not open source

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,870
so we open source that then it was on

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,550
github but it was not part of the Cloud

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,830
Foundry upstream so we push that as well

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,900
to Cloud Foundry upstream and that's

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,150
what we try to do so as much as we can

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,039
open source is great but we try to be

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,680
upstream as well with the development

00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,840
that we do and when they are not we try

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,620
to push them up stream and

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,960
uncontroverted is another one if you're

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,690
interested that's under the OpenStack

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,180
foundation it's a lifecycle manager to

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,590
deploy containerized services so we are

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,530
planning to containerize OpenStack

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,120
containerized staff and deploy and

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,039
manage that with our ship that that

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,330
could be an interesting thing to look at

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,680
that's it about souza so what's great

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,560
with the way that openSUSE

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,199
unity and scissor work is that I think

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,330
we collaborate in a very unique way so

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,690
it probably started two or three years

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,690
ago with the leap and Factory and

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,639
tumbleweed speed and it took a little

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,070
bit of time but I think today the

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,470
factory first concept is working very

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,669
nicely there are always fingers that we

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:57,630
can improve but whatever Suzie does for

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:00,600
products it goes into factory and that's

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,490
how we release less that's how we

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,330
release different flavors ups less and

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:12,750
the latest child of that union is Lib

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,169
15:1 and it was released what two three

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,440
days ago

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:19,860
I haven't upgraded yet I wanted to do

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,570
that on stage but I will not do it I

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,900
will do it later so that I can continue

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,930
with my slides but that's a great new

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,180
thing so if you haven't upgraded you

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,699
should probably try it it seems to work

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,380
quite nicely it's burrowing even people

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,810
are saying during upgrades or good

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,500
upgrades so congratulations to everybody

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,500
involving that

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
so that's for the things between

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,230
openSUSE and Suzhou that works fine

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
there are things that are a bit more

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,150
challenging and we want to be

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,740
transparent as well so I don't want only

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,540
to talk about good things I want to talk

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,940
about things that we need to improve and

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,120
look from a different angle so I'm going

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,480
to use the cubic and gas container as a

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,200
service platform example today those two

00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,840
things are not tightly integrated they

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,780
are not actually working together so on

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,820
the left you have version 3 of gasp it's

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,770
the current version and we are going to

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,060
release gas version 4 on the right and

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,610
what we are changing is we're lining

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,260
from an architectural standpoint the

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,560
open source projects and components that

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,020
CASP is using to be close out to cubic

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,170
because we think that will help us

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,910
working together more efficiently in the

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,850
future

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:44,650
so from an OS 10 points they are still

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,020
discussion as well because gasp has bet

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,790
on micro s now we want to be able to run

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,490
CASP so the Suzhou abilities

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,770
distribution and top obviously including

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,480
transaction are upgrades so they are

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,290
still think that we need to discuss with

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,650
the cubic community as well in in there

00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:04,630
we are moving gasp was a bit lagging in

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,700
terms of supporting the latest upstream

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,520
kubernetes releases kubernetes is

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,070
released every quarter cubic was much

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,930
faster to adapt and include the latest

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,970
kubernetes but we were not able to do

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,220
that with gasp so we are changing this

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,110
we have different processes and now we

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,850
can be in sync much better with

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,890
kubernetes upstream and that means that

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,320
will help us as well to be more closer

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:28,990
to cubic which CASP starting from Kaz

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:33,070
before which change the container engine

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,950
in in Cass before dropping we were using

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,230
the docker community and in Community

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,570
Edition engine in the previous version

00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:43,240
we are moving to cryo on top of frenzy

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:47,650
and that again is going to make us

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,590
closer to Quebec which is cryo friendly

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,240
since quite a while already and we are

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,770
pretty happy actually to drop some of

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,820
the links with the docker engine and

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,190
unger cryo

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,420
and the networking side as well tomorrow

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,270
morning I think there's a keynote about

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,040
psyllium from Thomas Roth we are very

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,100
interested by that project we contribute

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,930
to that and we are planning to bring

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,340
psyllium in Caspari for two so on this

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,170
slide I'm putting some reference to

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,390
sessions that are happening today

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,800
tomorrow and Sunday so if you're

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,930
interested by any of the topics that I'm

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,480
mentioning there you can also join those

00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,010
sessions later they will be much more

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,540
interesting and detailed and what I can

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:31,100
say about the the topics so one last

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,830
thing I wanted to mention as well

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:41,360
it's ruk ruk is a project to help use

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,430
safe for container infrastructure and we

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,960
are actually building rook now on top of

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,550
CASP with cubic as well and it's almost

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,570
all green so it's from yesterday nights

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:57,860
I hope today it's green as well and the

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,750
top-left side of things now I've talked

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,070
about Switzer and openSUSE but what's

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,400
really making a difference it's the

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,590
people and the project so I'm using a

00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,240
few screenshots from github profiles I

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,980
hope people don't mind I didn't ask them

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,440
for permission to put their faces on the

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,240
screen I hope that's okay

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,420
but I wanted to highlight the fact that

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,400
it's about people doing things and

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,840
whether they are zoo employees or part

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,300
of the open to the community and that's

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,650
what employees it doesn't really matter

00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,480
but they are doing really cool cool

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,140
things and I took just a few examples

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,740
there one of them is open fast so that's

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:36,830
a server less framework there was a

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,680
torque at OSC 18 last year and it was a

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:43,160
slight less presentation so no slides

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,580
from panels I also wanted to mention

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,360
traffic and there's a great blog post

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,500
and the Kubik website by panels again

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,530
describing how to use traffic and

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,560
security policies of communities to do

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,870
some ingress and load balancing in a

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,080
kubernetes environment very cool stuff

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,200
on top of cubic and the last one is

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,310
kata-kata containers so if you are not

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,870
familiar with cata

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,030
it's a kind of

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,130
it's a mix between a container and the

00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,860
VM there are some part of the hypervisor

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,650
in the container image it's actually

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:23,300
improving the isolation of containers

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:26,330
it's Runcie compliant as well and the

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,030
people they are they helped integrating

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,290
cata with cubic which Susak as platform

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,370
as well

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,670
and and with cryo so the cata project is

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:41,420
actually running their CI infrastructure

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:43,220
on top of less and they use OBS as well

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,330
apparently to build guitar so that's

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,490
pretty cool and yeah under writes I

00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:53,990
added a cup of coffee for this morning

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:56,570
that's vagrants and we're doing Dan is

00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,880
doing really cool things with vagrants

00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:05,510
building images as well so we can check

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:10,610
that too if you're interested talking

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:13,580
about building so OBS you all know that

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,470
right so we can build with Kiwi

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:20,240
container images from OBS now and

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,380
different flavor of container images

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,810
falsely for for leap the good thing is

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:30,500
that then we have an open Susur registry

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:34,190
to host the container images and scan

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,020
them so it's a good thing we don't want

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,060
to do the car hub I don't know if you

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,620
read the news recently but like a few

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,770
days ago they discovered that there were

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,950
about 2,000 container images on the car

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:49,490
hub whether the root password was blank

00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,110
so some security concerns there and I

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,590
think what we are doing there is

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,390
actually a lot better and Susie is also

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,550
working on a suitor registry to be used

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:03,620
for commercial customers and partners

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,980
and also tightly integrated with OBS so

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,330
again there are talks about about that

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,330
on Friday and on tomorrow as well

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,019
now I had two more projects that I

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,640
wanted to highlight and one is maven and

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:24,040
I think free trade she's in the room so

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,550
based on the rock yeah he's hiding

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:32,769
somewhere if you keep hiding I will ask

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:34,570
you to come and stay erection so we have

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,430
to give credit to people as well so it's

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:40,060
based on what the Fedora guys I've done

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,769
with rpm macros but radish and a few

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,779
other people they've done a lot of work

00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:47,320
to make that work properly with factory

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:49,990
and also building that quite nicely in

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,459
OBS without adding cycles to abuse it's

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,110
pretty cool a lot of packages and

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,329
talking about packages I'm very happy

00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,829
with package wrap I've been very excited

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:02,740
about package wrap in the past and I'm

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:05,860
even more now because by default all the

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:09,310
lip packages are coming in to package up

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,940
now I think it's from package hub 15 but

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,610
it started with 12 sp4 as well so it's

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,089
pretty cool and I also wanted to give

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,980
credit there because from a user

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,079
perspective it helps us a lot

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:31,390
twelve thousands of packages on packaged

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:33,730
hub for our customers actually now we've

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:37,420
where we've started the developer

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,800
program inside Suzhou I think Marco will

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,839
be there if he's not already there and

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,810
there's a session tomorrow it actually

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,820
two sessions about that with the

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,040
developer program we are trying to

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,399
address a gap that we think we have at a

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,890
Suzy level is less is well known by UPS

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,360
guys by CSF means but we are lacking

00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,910
visibility with the developer community

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,250
we don't want to become Ubuntu but still

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,779
we need to be closer to the developers

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,420
and show them all the great tools that

00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:07,329
we have thanks to the openSUSE community

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:11,040
as well OBS open QA all of that bring

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:15,490
that together and help developers with

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,019
with with openSUSE hands less so we're

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,360
also that's why we do stuff like

00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,920
vagrants as well and we try to improve

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
how we can deliver technologies to

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,000
develop our for developers

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,010
last thing I wanted to mention we are

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,440
doing hack weeks inside Suzhou so that's

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,390
a week where engineers are free to do

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,330
whatever they want to do it doesn't have

00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,620
to be work rate it doesn't have to be

00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,530
sometimes they don't even code anything

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,630
or they don't even open a laptop they

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,950
can do paintings or whatever but most of

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,550
the time engineers when they have free

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,870
time they do stuff with computers so I

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,500
wanted to highlight a couple of projects

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,970
so there's a website where people are

00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,250
creating their projects or you can check

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,910
the projects and join them and there are

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,680
a lot of openSUSE related projects there

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,910
where everybody is actually free you

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,560
don't have to be a suzer employee to

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,890
participate as well so you're welcome to

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,900
join that so I just took three examples

00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:18,190
one in the ui/ux pace so this is about

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:20,020
doing a UI to a great openSUSE and we

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:23,010
have a UI UX team in the room as well

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:26,500
there's a session later this morning at

00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:29,130
10:45 they are doing it's not a only bot

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,870
code it's also about UI UX and

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,880
documentation as well so yeah I would

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,750
encourage you to go Darren and see what

00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,370
they are doing if you don't know what

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,290
you're doing

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,960
they also project there's a project to

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,430
bring some of the visual visual effects

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:49,300
libraries in package up so that's the

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,930
one on the right and finally one is

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,090
about a specific board from the setup

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:59,140
box that someone wants to try to bring

00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,330
lip or priority factory on so it's an of

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,980
June if you have time if you're

00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,270
interested you could check the projects

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,730
you could add one of your projects there

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:13,180
and and work to get on and that's all I

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,250
had for today but I'm like to make it

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,520
open as well so if you have any

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,140
questions comments or inputs please I

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,830
think there's a mic in the back of the

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,459
room or I can mic to you as well yeah if

00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,459
you have questions

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:45,300
the other question that go you're just

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:47,190
being for coffee okay so if you do have

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,700
a question you do have to come back here

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:53,060
because it's not Wireless and I can't

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,060
bring it to you

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:11,850
