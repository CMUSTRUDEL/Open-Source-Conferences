Adding support for LPWA wireless technologies

At ELCE 2018 I presented a project to implement Linux kernel drivers for LoRa Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) wireless technology. The project is since evolving to cover more chipsets and other technologies. This is a brief overview of what is being worked on and how to participate. It will also explain how openSUSE Tumbleweed aarch64 has been used as base for most of the kernel development.
