A New openSUSE Desktop Distribution?

Kubic with its MicroOS core is an exciting distribution that takes much of the cool stuff we're doing in Tumbleweed, adds solutions to the problems of updating a running system, and is becoming the perfect base system for running containers.

But in openSUSE, running server stuff is only half the fun.

Why should servers be the only platform enjoying automatic, atomic, "auto-rollbackable" system updates?

Surely desktop users want to be lazy like server admins also?

Can the tools and approaches implemented in MicroOS help create the desktop distribution of the future?

Let's find out!

This talk will introduce the concept of 'openSUSE MicroOS Desktop', a desktop focused variant of MicroOS based on Tumbleweed.

Various ideas will be discussed, prototypes will be shown, and feedback will be expected from the audience to help shape this potentially exciting take on the future of openSUSE on Desktops.
