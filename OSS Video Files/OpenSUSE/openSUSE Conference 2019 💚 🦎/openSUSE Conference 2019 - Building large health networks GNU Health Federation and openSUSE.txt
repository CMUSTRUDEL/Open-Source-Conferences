10 years of Freedom and Equity in Healthcare

GNU Health is the Free/Libre Health and Hospital Information System that is included in openSUSE.

GNU Health combines the socioeconomic determinants of health with state-of-the-art technology in bioinformatics and clinical genetics. It provides holistic picture of the person, from the biological and molecular basis of disease to the environmental determinants of health. In addition, it manages the internal processes of a health institution, such as financial management, billing, stock management, pharmacies or labs (LIMS)

The GNU Health Federation introduced in 3.4 series allows to build nationwide federated networks with thousands of heterogeneous nodes. The GNU Health federation is revolutionary, and will allow the community, the health practitioners, the research institutions and the ministries of health to have much better perspective and precise information on the individuals and their context.

Having the GNU Health Federation in openSUSE (available both for Tumbleweed and Leap) not only provides the development environment, but the server stability to deploy it in hospitals and large heterogeneous health networks across a country.

good afternoon everybody

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:14,910
anyone from the

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:18,119
care industry okay we have one - good

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,220
well we're going to talk anybody knows

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:26,610
about the new health at all

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,250
great so today we were just going to go

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:34,080
over a quick review of what the project

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,020
is some notable implementations and the

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:42,900
philosophy of course behind the new

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:47,250
health project so about our project it's

00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:50,089
first and foremost a social project okay

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,750
so it has technology behind it of course

00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:57,720
but we use technology just as a tool we

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,879
really need to provide freedom and

00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,580
equity in healthcare that's that's the

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,890
goal of the new Health Project so

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,320
technology is very important but it's

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,119
just a tool okay this is very important

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,890
because most of us here are either

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,560
computer scientists or something related

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,020
to that you know and it's it's very good

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,240
to work with

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,000
programming but we need to have a goal

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:29,430
at the end of the day to know what we

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,280
are doing this is part of the team some

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:38,400
of us are here already and the new solid

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:44,000
area is the NGO that serves as an

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,000
umbrella for the new health project okay

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,610
for the project to be free we need to

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:56,880
rely on free technology all of this

00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:00,050
technology that we have here this

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,800
components are free as in freedom right

00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,450
at the moment of if any of these guys

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,429
would become non free the whole project

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,560
will collapse so it's very important

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,849
that we choose the right components when

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,739
we make this type of large community

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:22,980
managed community-based projects right

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,680
we used to have MongoDB MongoDB is no

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,650
longer

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,470
because of the issues that they had with

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,990
the licensing and so on so now we use

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:36,150
all poster space balls for the

00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:41,230
transactional part and the analytic

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:44,500
operations so it's a new health is

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,300
pretty much an ecosystem it works with

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,330
different components and this is the

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,420
main functionality that we have we

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:55,660
always said that we want people before

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:59,590
patients right so we work before on the

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,840
demographics on on healthy population so

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:06,790
we know the socioeconomic status we know

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,500
our health institutions our health

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:14,020
providers and so on domiciliary units

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,390
what's the status of those houses how

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,230
many people live in those houses and so

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,840
on

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,400
do they have electricity we have sewers

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,530
and so after we have done that and again

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,470
here we don't have any patients yet we

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,430
have people we move to the typical

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,050
electronic medical record that's where

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,350
in hospital management system that's

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,610
where you know you have the patients you

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,580
have the doctors you have the

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,140
interactions you have the labs medical

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,690
evaluations hospitalizations and so on

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,810
third part would be the ERP okay that's

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,240
that's where we take care of the health

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,209
institution itself okay that's where we

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:04,600
have finances we have stock management

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:09,520
we have pharmacies and so on Human

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:13,180
Resources the limbs and finally we make

00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,060
sense of all the data that we've been

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,570
collecting through this transactional

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,960
part before so here is where you know

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,180
the Ministry of Health they did the

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,140
management of the health institutions

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,760
we'll be taking care of demographics

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:34,090
epidemiology and so on that's those are

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,940
the four main areas of new health and

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:43,960
different technology is going to be

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:47,620
being different radius within this

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,640
ecosystem we have pretty much the six

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,380
areas here new health this is the what I

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,330
just talked about you know the hospital

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,110
management information information

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,360
system then we have different ways of

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,810
packaging and providing it for example

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:13,390
one of them is embedded where we use

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:14,980
single ball devices recipes and so on we

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,000
have the new Health Federation that I

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:22,150
will talk today pretty much about that

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,460
this is an ongoing project for mobile

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,680
device and just survey one we're having

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,990
some talks overnight we were saying hey

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:41,590
you know what's good that we actually

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:44,500
didn't do anything what's on Android

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,360
because of what we've seen not only

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,900
because of that I already have doubts

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,970
because the operating system itself is

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,760
not free so we don't know what's really

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,640
going on behind the scenes and here we

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:02,620
are talking about sensible data medical

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:05,200
data and so on so anyone if anyone is

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,910
into plasma mobile or whatever please

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,430
let me know because I would really get

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:12,910
like to get in touch with you and see

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:17,020
how we can derive this part into plasma

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,970
mobile laboratory information system

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,820
these are a set of modules for that and

00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:25,360
no health bioinformatics has to do with

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:30,460
genomics and genetics and Empire

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,100
informatics in general more into the

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:38,050
research these are just some screenshots

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:44,910
of different modules from imaging to

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:48,520
reporting to college or pathology IVs

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,350
person or patient control center and so

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,080
on so different

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,560
different people different organizations

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,360
will be using one or more of these

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,480
modules it's it's modular meaning that

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,970
depending on what is the needs of my

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,490
institution I will install one two or

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:11,470
whatever modules are good need for for

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:15,910
running it so now let's get a little bit

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,770
into the Federation because it's you

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,220
know health is very focus on public

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,040
health system okay we we we are

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,980
convinced that health it's a

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,660
non-negotiable human right so we have to

00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:33,430
work in the idea of public health that

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,460
doesn't mean that if you have a private

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,240
hospital you cannot install it of course

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,490
you can but my goal is that everybody no

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,190
matter where you are on what is your

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:52,690
socioeconomic status should be able to

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:55,090
benefit from health informatics so what

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:59,800
what is the idea behind the Federation

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:03,280
well we have nodes okay each of these

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,650
icon represents a node and a node it's

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,910
autonomous they don't need the network

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:12,870
to work fully functional its

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:16,450
heterogeneous they can use different

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,270
technologies but yet they can

00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:25,660
communicate to each other and of course

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:33,420
it must be accessible insecure in order

00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:33,420
to do that we create this sort of

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,750
infrastructure where we have all these

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,479
nodes those were the ones that we just

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,330
saw on the previous slide then we have a

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:50,890
message and a knows authentication

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:53,740
server we call it thalamus and at the

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:57,070
end of it we have the health information

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,910
system that's also a person master index

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,980
that's where you know I can go and see

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:07,990
what's the demographics and that person

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:11,740
on whatever and again these guys can

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,649
work autonomously but if you want you

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,170
can say I want this specific model to be

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,639
part of the new health Federation and at

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,180
that moment you will start sharing

00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:29,490
information back and forth with the

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,490
other federating Federation nodes

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:38,589
difficult problems need to be solved in

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,600
an easy matter if you want to scale if

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,850
you want to have something where

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,420
simplicity is the most important part of

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:52,570
this because in healthcare things tend

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:57,850
to grow exponentially if you have 2 3 5

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:59,980
10 100 hospitals in your region or in

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,740
your country you have to make sure that

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,350
all that information is flowing nicely

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,680
back and forth within the Federation and

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,889
the other participating nodes are not

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,380
going to be generating collisions and so

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:16,360
on so one of the things that I did was

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,870
creating the concept of book of life the

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,990
book of life is made of pages of life

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,740
and each page of life has its own

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:35,260
categories so for example you can create

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:41,019
a social page of life which can also be

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:43,209
part of the social type from here you

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:46,930
have different events like social

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:51,639
exclusion the lifestyle stress whatever

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:54,760
you know I mean in the medical part we

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,649
have a type of page medical and then you

00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,630
will have whether you had an encounter

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:05,459
where you have a genetic testing or so

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:08,920
in this way you have a simple system to

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:11,019
organize all the events that went

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,610
through your life they don't need to be

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,690
necessarily medical you can have

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,120
biographical type of pages

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,230
while you were born you were married or

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,140
whatever and and in it you will be also

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:34,100
able to be read sequentially just as a

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:37,230
book or plaque right so if we do that

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,300
now we have a system of Health instead

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,610
of a system of disease that that's what

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,670
in the Western countries we also used to

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,240
as a physician I see people that comes

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:51,410
sick and should be the other way around

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,480
or or at least we should aim as

00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,700
positions to try to see as many healthy

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,080
people as possible and prevent those

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:03,030
healthy people to be sick or to get sick

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,460
but you know unfortunately it doesn't

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,670
work like that the system today in the

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,970
Western countries is more into the

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,340
system of disease you try to kill

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,230
somebody because that person got sick

00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,230
and most of the time that person got

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:23,130
sick because you didn't take the

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:26,630
preventative measure to keep that person

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:30,590
healthy so having these now you have

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:36,180
multiple health professionals working in

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:39,930
parallel not only on the biological part

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,590
but also on the social psychological

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:47,730
part of it and this transdisciplinary

00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:50,040
approach to health is going to be way

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:59,880
more richer than the one that we are

00:12:50,040 --> 00:13:03,510
used to nowadays so how do we build

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,330
those large networks here for example we

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:10,860
put a case of new health in the context

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:14,280
of cancer research here we have one of

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:17,460
the genes Braga one and you know this

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,170
case is responsible for for breast and

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:23,760
ovarian cancer and

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:29,480
type of of ailments and enough if you

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:33,089
can see in this slide you have over 40

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,570
different natural variations or variants

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:40,350
of these specific genes so defining

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,540
amino acid changed the structure of the

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:49,320
protein making it not very functional

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:51,600
and in many cases we know what is the

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,810
implication of that specific natural

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,600
variant okay literature say well if you

00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:01,709
have this specific natural button you

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,720
have this chances of you know having

00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:07,170
breast cancer somewhere around all your

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,029
life but in many other cases we don't

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,570
know what is the clinical significance

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:16,470
of the Natural Balance in the only way

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:20,550
today of knowing it is by having a very

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:22,699
large and in statistics right so the

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,510
more people that we have with that

00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:31,529
specific variant we are going to be able

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,990
to infer right what would be the

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:39,000
clinical significance of that that until

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:41,010
today is a noun that is one of that is

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,360
one of the beauties of having this

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,870
federated model

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,050
so do you aggregate a lot of data from a

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,480
lot of different places and now not only

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,800
we are going to be basing ourselves on

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,860
the molecular basis of health or disease

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,100
so we are not just going to have this

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,130
amino acid change we are going to also

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:11,640
include family history we are going to

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:14,399
include lifestyle and other factors that

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,320
are going to influence you know whether

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:21,600
you are going to express at the end of

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,970
the day that this is or not so here is

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,459
an example of all the things that we are

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:30,870
going to have on one specific page of

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:33,000
life of that person right and and and

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,000
this is where you get the date of

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:42,449
on the new health hospital management

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,980
information system and you also are

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:49,319
going to have the representation of all

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,209
the data not just from the hospital

00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:54,629
management information system now we are

00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:57,209
seeing a JSON oriented representation of

00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,310
that it's machine readable but it's also

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,329
human readable anybody can pretty much

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:11,610
read what's going on here okay with this

00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:13,800
specific person now one one of the big

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,930
problems that we face today in

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:24,569
healthcare and public administration in

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:26,610
general it's the concept of silo silo is

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:31,139
something that is pretty much closed

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:33,029
right so many health institutions they

00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:36,300
have their own databases by they don't

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:39,269
talk to each other I always put the

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,399
pretty much the same example on Spain if

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,579
somebody comes to Canary Islands from

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,889
Barcelona or Madrid I have to start all

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:49,800
over the clinical history of that person

00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:51,569
because different autonomies don't talk

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,480
to each other in the healthcare system

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:57,540
okay so this is what we have we have

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,389
hospitals and they are closed they are

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,029
silos this guy doesn't talk to this guy

00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,620
and if somebody comes to this hospital

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:07,500
today in tomorrow goes to this hospital

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:11,030
he has to start all over from not only

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,439
he or her but the health professional

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:18,720
and whoever works in the Public Health

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,089
Administration or as a as a health

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,459
professional you know that is very

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,589
limited at the time that you have per

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,280
patient so you pretty much have six

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:32,520
seven minute at most so from those six

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,530
seven minutes you have to spend five of

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,530
them taking the clinical history you are

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:43,730
in trouble so what do we propose well I

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,830
propose this sort of federated model

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:50,700
where again each

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:54,990
note so this will be notes are

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,990
independent yet they can share the

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:01,110
information the Free Software Foundation

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:06,390
Europe came with that campaign of public

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:11,340
money public code that we fully endorse

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:15,390
and I mean it's it's it's common sense

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:20,520
we cannot have a public health system

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:21,780
with a private health system it just

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,790
doesn't work like that

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,540
if I have a computer system that is

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,400
closed cannot by definition be run on

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,250
the public health system it just doesn't

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,740
make sense well it doesn't make sense

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:40,190
but that is the reality today pretty

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:45,180
much I would say in 95% 99% of the cases

00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:48,930
most hospitals malls health system

00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:51,150
running proprietary hardware and

00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,970
software and that is not good that is

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,970
not good at all we we you have to think

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,460
of black boxes where you are putting

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,030
your medical information and you don't

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,860
know where that medical information is

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,870
going who is actually going to be

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,900
benefitting from the data that is coming

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,500
from you as a person in this case as a

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,250
patient

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:20,130
so it's morally wrong to use software

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:24,240
that is not free in the public health

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:26,130
set for many reasons it's not just a

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,260
matter of money I mean there are so many

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:33,720
other things that had to do with you

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:40,820
know your data and and empowerment of

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:43,230
the community so hey you know we are in

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,440
European elections now we should send

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:49,370
this slide to all our politicians and

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:54,210
say what do you think about it you know

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:58,710
what would it take for you to go this

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,409
way those are the things that we as a

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,570
community should do

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:04,759
as I said before at the beginning you

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,419
know this is not just technical there is

00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:11,299
so many other philosophical things to

00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:13,879
put on top of the table and talk to you

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:17,989
know our politicians and say hey guy you

00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:19,399
cannot run private software here it's

00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:28,970
not just because it has Springs it

00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:31,129
because it's in model so quickly the

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,159
relationship with openSUSE and the new

00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,899
health here we have Excel he didn't

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,639
bring that suit today he brought the

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:43,129
mozilla one which is probably more

00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:45,169
appropriate for the ford event you know

00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:48,470
it's been years already where he is

00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:53,299
working and in packaging a new health

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:56,269
for poor opensuse and documenting EDT

00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:59,450
again it's a large project so it's it's

00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:02,690
a lot of war behind it so it's good to

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,239
have somebody in different a new linux

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,649
distros that work on on packages

00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:13,820
although you know which a brand was

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:16,879
talking before packaging a large system

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,489
with multiple components as new health

00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:22,460
is not always that trivial you know so

00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:24,830
we also provide the panel installation

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,499
for whatever operating system you want

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,480
to use so we want to use openSUSE you

00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:32,149
can just ran the panel installation and

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,179
have it you know the file system

00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:38,499
hierarchy where the files are and other

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:43,669
things that role is harder to

00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:46,039
encapsulate it in a package we all know

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:52,009
this one so we can just pass it which is

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:55,609
one or the other and also you can always

00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:58,999
switch to half you know professional

00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:00,619
support if you have a large institution

00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:05,090
or review and have the people on site

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:08,389
that wants to maintain or support

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,650
installation of new health you can

00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:18,120
always go for enterprise

00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:23,280
settings are things so when we were

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,660
talking about the project embedded new

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,520
health and Bella project we are working

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:34,080
today with one of the devices is Arduino

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,260
and open source has been very nice to us

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:44,790
also by sponsoring you know the new

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:46,710
health cone and the Kiwi so this part of

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:52,680
the reason I'm here today so thank you

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:55,920
so we we have a hub this this is pretty

00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,270
much a demo server where people just can

00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,280
log-in no matter where you are in the

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,690
world and play around with your instance

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,550
and your nodes and see if it is actually

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,440
shaping up the way that that you need

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,700
all you need to do more customizations

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:17,720
or whatever this is in yet in Germany

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,720
say rapping in ranks also openSUSE lip

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:29,070
and finally let me just go through some

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:33,600
projects around the globe so we go from

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,700
very small very small but we go from

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,630
small clinics this is in the vein

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:45,120
poorest in Cameroon where you know they

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:50,460
have all disability solar panels and the

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:54,600
installation running there two very

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,550
large implementations All India

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,400
Institute of Medical Science is the

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:04,830
largest hospital in Asia it's it's huge

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,720
so it doesn't really make much of a

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,980
difference of course in the

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,990
implementation it does but the

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,360
functionality of a health institution is

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,550
pretty much the same you know you have

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,430
stock management you have people you

00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:20,100
have human resources you have par masses

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:24,280
you have flames then you can have many

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:30,400
more tests on aims that in

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:33,910
that we were seeing before on this one

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,059
but at the end and you know you have

00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:41,470
people you have health professionals you

00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:46,900
have labs and you try to do the best for

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:49,210
your community working with WH o world

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,160
health organization this is poor Bahia

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:57,850
district hospital again using some of

00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,640
the standards the WHL has already and it

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:05,350
makes it much easier to be able to

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,020
create this one world one health in

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,210
where you have your your clinical

00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,059
history here in Germany and you want to

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,650
take it to Spain a health professional

00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,480
there should be able to really because

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:20,080
his based on standards on medical

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,140
standard medical coding and we work with

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,559
them in this case this is for universal

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:32,740
health campaign and an another district

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:34,990
hospital in Cameroon Jamaica Ministry of

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,280
Health this was one of the very earliest

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,169
adopters since 2013 I believe so it's

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:50,830
being over six years that they've been

00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:57,480
using it a nation nationwide level the

00:25:50,830 --> 00:26:03,940
Red Cross specifically in in Mexico Laos

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:05,650
Ministry of Health the new Health

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,390
Alliance of academic and research

00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,360
institutions this is one of the things

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,440
that I invite anybody that has or works

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:18,419
in a university or research institution

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:21,340
to join us we just signed up with the

00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,720
national university of interviews in in

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,660
in argentina a five-year memorandum to

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,470
work alone them in the implementation of

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:35,380
new health in in different countries and

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,840
and of course is linked to the Carribean

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,870
different

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,169
academic centers have been working with

00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:48,279
us in defending areas of the world and I

00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:49,929
I feel after these ten years that is

00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:53,200
probably the most rewarding thing

00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:57,520
because look at people that is very who

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,830
are high qualified that knows the latest

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,240
on different areas whether is social

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:06,580
medicine or worries by informatics and

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,950
they join us in different master

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,840
programs or whatever and of course the

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:19,350
community of new health benefits from

00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:19,350
that and that is pretty much it

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,000
Richard Stallman always says happy

00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:30,760
hacking when he finishes his talks or

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,130
his mails and I just added the healthy

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,980
hacking there I think that what is

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,950
important here is to have this little

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,140
sentence there that we tend to forget

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,740
that you know health is a human right

00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,440
and it should be three and it should be

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:51,159
universal and of course should never be

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,630
negotiable anybody that needs health no

00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,830
matter whether you're very rich or very

00:27:52,630 --> 00:28:00,640
poor we should be able to get the best

00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:03,149
health practitioner possible and this

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,240
was the very first project that we did

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:12,490
in 2006 in in Argentina so these have

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:15,340
now grown up ladies and gentlemen and it

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:20,590
was what actually motivated me to move

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:25,029
from doing the gnu/linux installations

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:27,190
on public schools to actually tackle the

00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:31,179
socio-economic determinants of health of

00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:34,240
many of these kids to be able to race in

00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:38,260
health and indignity because that's of

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,710
course what they all deserve so thank

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:45,820
you I hope you like it thank you

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:51,650
[Applause]

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:55,750
now we have enough time - any questions

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:58,670
that you may have about the project or

00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,500
if you want to join us of course if you

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,210
want to donate a lot of money that would

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:07,850
be even better we are all open for that

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:13,900
so any questions that you may have on

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:13,900
the project yes

00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:30,570
it's very hard because free software

00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:36,370
projects unless you put a counter

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:38,380
somewhere you know sometimes you know

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,389
about projects when they have a problem

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,779
so they go to the mailing list and say

00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:50,860
hey you know we have this problem now we

00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:53,049
are we are documenting in a whu-oh page

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,860
is called the health atlas if i'm not

00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:57,159
mistaken

00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:02,230
where we are putting all the known

00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:06,250
projects that we know but you know we

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:10,389
have pretty much in all continents we

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:15,190
have in India we have in Pakistan we

00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:18,880
have in Argentina most of them are

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,460
southern hemisphere you know if you look

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:26,889
at the map most of nahma but we also

00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:30,970
happen in Japan will happen Jamaica we

00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:33,190
have in Mexico and then again you know

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,700
sometimes you see somebody from Peru

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,529
saying hey I have this issue and then I

00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,659
good can you please tell us where you

00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:42,279
actually install it and it's up to them

00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:44,309
of course I mean it's nothing that we

00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,700
track or anything like that

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:50,980
the project is hosted at the you know

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,080
site so you can just go to health that

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,470
can do that org and download it from

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,990
there

00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,220
and we do not have any tracking things

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:05,590
so just download it it would be very

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:09,519
nice to have hopefully this map that

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:12,279
it's part of the whu-oh will help us

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,169
also and will help the people that is

00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:17,289
actually implementing it in this places

00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:19,419
to just join it and and register

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:23,649
themselves there so you have an idea

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:28,450
who's actually doing working because we

00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,909
need to make the project sustainable and

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:34,120
this is probably the hardest part

00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:36,850
because you can go today to Cameroon for

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,330
example and do implementation but if you

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,680
live

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:45,160
you don't have capacity-building there

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,590
the project is not going to maintain

00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:51,540
itself because you need people that

00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:54,640
knows about computers there knows about

00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,410
health informatics in general to be able

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:04,210
these these are large projects you know

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:06,520
this is not like text document thing you

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,470
need to build capacity there and that's

00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,450
probably the hardest part so if we have

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,070
that map that we were talking then you

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,810
will know who actually did

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,670
implementation where and the local

00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:23,100
people can actually reach those people

00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:23,100
so that's that's where we're moving yes

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:54,370
right well it really depends on the

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:58,120
source pretty much so if the existing

00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:00,460
system allows you to interface via web

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,810
service or beer you know if they can

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:10,170
actually put that in XML or JSON format

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:12,910
or or even interface between web service

00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,160
you can get the demographic data or you

00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:19,360
can get the clinical history and then it

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:21,880
comes to okay where or how much data do

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,890
I want to import because many times what

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,260
happens is you are getting things that

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,260
are not outdated or whatever you know so

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:36,400
it depends I would say that in general

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:38,380
before doing the the migration from one

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,280
system to another is what do you

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,870
actually want to implement I mean if you

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,790
are going to have financial management

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:49,270
if you are going to have policies you're

00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,940
going to have limbs it's going to take

00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,310
more time because you need different

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:57,700
departments to work on all these areas

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:59,920
and customize it also to your so every

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,110
single country needs to have specific

00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,940
reports that you hand to the Ministry of

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:09,310
Health in specific format and so on

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,590
and also depends on who do you actually

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:14,800
have on-site in the knowledge of those

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,470
guys because if you have people like in

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,840
Argentina the these guys are 100%

00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,669
independent they are doing their own

00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:27,190
implementations they've been doing it

00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:29,230
for years now and trubin pretty much see

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,370
any messages from then on the mailing

00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:36,400
list because they are doing it

00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:36,850
themselves now we have cases in Iraq for

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:42,220
example

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:45,669
and in India where they are just

00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,850
starting and it takes much more than

00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:50,140
just computer scientists this you know

00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,879
you need somebody that knows about

00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,710
financial accounting to do

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,839
all the charts of accounts and all this

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,029
stuff you need people to know about

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:04,390
stock management if you are going to put

00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:09,160
a pharmacy in place but it's again you

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:12,490
know it's if you have a good design of

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:18,220
your implementation if you have a good

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:20,380
blue book you know where all steps all

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,269
the resources that are going to be

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,000
involved in that implementation are

00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:29,230
there beforehand you are going to be

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,809
doing very well most of the mistakes in

00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:35,289
new health implementations come because

00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:37,119
people don't do people just install the

00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:41,430
system and think that you know that's

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:45,819
going to pretty much do it by itself and

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:49,420
hey that's pretty much everybody does

00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:54,789
this until they say hell no let's stop

00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:58,269
go back let's document you have a sort

00:35:54,789 --> 00:36:01,029
of a blueprint with all the steps with

00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:03,099
deadlines with meetings and with the

00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:05,589
resources and everything that takes to

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:10,420
make it a project like this if you have

00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:17,579
that I've seen people going live with

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,579
three four months of implementation that

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,920
if you are just leaves if you are just a

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,509
lab is much shorter most of the time

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,359
because the only thing that you need is

00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:31,329
to have the interfaces with the

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:34,630
apparatus to bring back you know the

00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:37,079
results and that's usually shorter but

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,490
if you want to have a full-blown

00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,710
hospital management information system

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,450
that takes time a lot of to do with

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:49,559
security with roles who can do what

00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:54,099
within the system it's a role based

00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:56,200
authorization system so so there are

00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,880
always two ways one way is doing it

00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,940
wrong and fast and the other one is

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,369
doing it slow and well and and of course

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,650
the second one is the way to go once you

00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:08,740
have it then you can scale well

00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:11,980
you know but it will be a very big

00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:18,210
mistake to just jump in without really

00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,210
knowing the system yes

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:48,740
I probably Excel knows more than that I

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:50,750
mean what we have at least two

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,530
installations in Germany from which we

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:58,010
know and the one is a house practitioner

00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:00,560
whose billing privately so he hasn't no

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:05,170
interface with the Konkan cousin with

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,060
the legal ones and the other one is a

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:11,560
daycare station for homeless refugees

00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:15,410
and people without health insurance so

00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:18,980
if we want to do billing or something

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:21,500
like that with the public health system

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,750
in Germany we need to have a certified

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,620
interface which we clearly don't have at

00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:29,920
the moment we can build it of course but

00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:34,400
it needs some kind of funding or

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,010
whatever our plan was to do this

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,660
together with academia and we're in

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:43,430
touch with for example the Apple on

00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,420
University of Applied Science in Bremen

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:50,420
but it's a lengthy process let's say it

00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:52,670
that way so if you have knowledge in

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,030
that area if you have people who are

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,320
willing to spend some money in there

00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:01,570
feel free to contact us to give you

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:08,470
another example we have a very active

00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:11,540
community member in in Austria and the

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:15,440
the practitioner Society of Vienna is

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:18,710
currently evaluating the usage of a free

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,950
software system for their practice in

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:26,570
the general Vienna area and they need

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:29,510
also a couple of data exchange sets for

00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,770
example which are standardized and use

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,990
are currently already being built

00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,760
because there we have really people who

00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,130
say yes we want this and we want to go

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,740
for a free solution and they taking some

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,080
money into their hand to realize this

00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:45,260
and as Louis mentioned this is a free

00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,400
system so you have to freedom to develop

00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,599
this further

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,109
to add modules to fulfill the legal

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,450
requirements for this

00:39:51,109 --> 00:40:00,520
to answer your question thank you thank

00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,520
you Axl yes

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:22,549
mm-hmm well one is Laos they implemented

00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:27,170
in the largest hospital and maha siddhis

00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:31,039
hospital and the other one is and also

00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:35,089
on the center of Medical rehab and the

00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,920
other one is Jamaica both both of them

00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:41,420
are the Ministry of Health who are

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:44,779
actually doing nationwide yeah and they

00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,960
hire in the case of to make it a higher

00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:50,900
local people to actually be part of the

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,170
Ministry of Health and doing it and hey

00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,539
you know this is this is very has a lot

00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,880
of Merit because these guys you know but

00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,499
you know we know how governments go you

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,059
know today you have one government and

00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,380
tomorrow you have another government in

00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,119
the government that comes tomorrow say

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,059
Ivan like this and he takes it out so

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,230
it's been there for six years he's it's

00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:16,039
a complete success

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:17,599
you know so it's it's it's not easy it's

00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:20,450
not easy at all because it takes a lot

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,299
of philosophy behind it's not just you

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,999
know a technical implementation on the

00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:29,059
contrary yes again you know I think that

00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:31,700
you know health is very solid in terms

00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:34,039
of technology but I think that is even

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,410
more solid in terms of philosophy and

00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:38,329
that's what moves us and then you know

00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,339
public health should be public and

00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,779
universal and that's why we're doing it

00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:44,619
then we can apply whatever

00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:47,690
state-of-the-art technology whether is

00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:51,289
again you know demographics epidemiology

00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:54,400
bioinformatics that's there we can we

00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:57,230
can do it you know in terms of

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,450
technology what is more difficult it's

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,630
actually convince the people convince

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:05,109
the authorities to actually use free

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:08,480
software in in public health care and

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:13,640
that's up to us but when I say up to us

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,369
is up to all of us to ask so when I'm

00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,999
going to vote somebody I'm going to say

00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:22,249
do you have free software in your

00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:23,869
program and if they say no way you know

00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,390
that's an easy way to keep point you

00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,839
know

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:34,080
and we should all do the same because

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:41,450
his is it's morally right to do so thank

00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:45,510
you any other question any other beer

00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:46,890
yeah and this looks better thank you

00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:52,469
very much guys thank you

00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:52,469
[Applause]

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,640
