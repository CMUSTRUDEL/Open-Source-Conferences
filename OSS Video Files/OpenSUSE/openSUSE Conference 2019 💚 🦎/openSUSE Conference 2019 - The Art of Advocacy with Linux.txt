Advocacy tricks 

Through this Lighting Talk I'd like to share some thoughts on the importance of Advocacy for the use of Linux distributions by various actors, starting with students or home users, to continue with Universities, Public Institutions and Governments. Educating the new generation to use Linux is something that should be seen of high importance. 

As there is a lot of progress done today with different Linux distros being massively used, a lot of improvements made in terms of the interface, security etc more efforts can be put in Advocacy. If today, as experienced users of Free Software, we understand our potential in getting more people to use Linux and we invest a little bit of our time in advocating it, we will definitely bring new users, some of which will definitely become new contributors.

Awareness of Linux, and FOSS is spread largely by word of mouth, using grass roots movements and social media. You can teach others how to use it, run a workshop in a school, teach a student how to install Linux, show different environments and tools. Another step, which requires more efforts and planning, can be to bring Linux in the Government as well. This is something we cannot do alone, but you can try to support organizations and communities who do a lot of work in this direction. We keep hearing on migrations to various FLOSS projects by different governments, yours can be the next one, and you can be part of that great change.

hello thanks for joining the

00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:18,820
presentation

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:21,939
I'm radon I come from oops I come from

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,480
Albania in a city called elbasan which

00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,169
is quite in the center of to like close

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,829
to Tirana

00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:33,130
it's quite a simple city very small and

00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:35,399
doesn't have much and now I live in

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,050
Tirana which is the capital of Albania

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,460
although I travel a lot for with

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,990
different events conference and stuff

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,760
like that if you want to one of the

00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,790
things that my birth city has is quite

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,690
important is that it has a lot of good

00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:54,040
food and it's Mediterranean so but it's

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,360
not very healthy so you should not

00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,210
consume it for a big period of time ok

00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,040
so I started with other people with

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,430
other folks the open labs hackerspace in

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,350
Tirana in 2012 I'm one of the initial

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,740
members and I do a lot of contributions

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,810
in Wikimedia OpenStreetMap libera office

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,300
and of course openSUSE mainly in

00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,780
localizations and also doing some events

00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,580
at the local hackerspace one two of the

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,620
events that were organized there that

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,409
I'm part of I've been part of since day

00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,180
one is the crypto party when people that

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,890
do not know a lot of technical stuff

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,120
about how to be safe online how to

00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:36,909
communicate in a very encrypted way it's

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,909
been running for two years now there's

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:42,159
gonna be the third year and it's quite

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,590
it's quite inspiring to see people that

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,240
were technophobic first talk about

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:52,570
encryption in the end of the events it

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:56,110
the event started with Arion campus one

00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,960
of the people of the Dutch community hoc

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,700
42 and other initiatives and now also

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm part of the Oscar conference which

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,409
was a week before and it actually

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,930
gathers all the initiatives in Albania

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:10,929
that are related to open source free

00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:16,420
software privacy online open data and

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:18,160
stuff like that a month this is like I'm

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,860
also mentioning my company because it's

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,910
related

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,280
heavily with the element of advocacy and

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,440
why we do this it's not the company

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,570
itself but it's the ecosystem behind it

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,810
it's called collective sixty sixty eight

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,820
and we offer cloud services for people

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,550
that do not know what do not want to

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,780
manage open-source instances just like

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,040
next loud which is the talk next

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:50,360
attendance matter most and stuff like

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:52,310
that okay so I'm kind of sad because

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,930
usually when I was going to this kind of

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,959
events a lot of people are talking about

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,760
like Linux the importance of advocacy

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,330
and now it's a lot about the industry

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,650
which is nice money is good and we

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,830
should pay the rent as well in the end

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,390
of the month but also advocacy in our

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:14,060
industry or in our area it's also

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:17,090
related not only to to the doing good

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,780
but also to companies as well right so

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,880
every company needs to have whatever it

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,110
is it's tech company its agriculture

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,470
whatever it is it needs to talk about

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,600
why it's good what they're doing so if

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,190
you go to merriam-webster it says that

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,230
the Federation of advocacy is the act of

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:40,940
process of supporting a cause a proposal

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:45,049
the act or process of advocating which

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,700
is obvious we know this right and in our

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,760
communities and businesses and

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:54,440
institutions for people that are in the

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,090
institutions our focus is free and open

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,450
source technologies in general of their

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,200
privacy and open data and and this end

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,959
public domain in a lot of cases so

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,220
advocacy in general and we now know

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,510
advocacy for for our industry and what

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,840
does it matter

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,360
I mentioned before it matters because in

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,579
any environments including the free and

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,209
open source movement there are many

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,890
actors there are enthusiasts or people

00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,000
that just like it for because the thing

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,790
is the right thing to do there are

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,330
people that have companies there are

00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,010
public institutions that need to know

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,660
there are so many so many situations

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,220
that do not know

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,880
things that we are doing and the way we

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,680
are doing it right and in the end of the

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,660
day we are part of the sin one way or

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,880
the other we get connected because we

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,270
are part of the same you know bucket of

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,560
stuff that happens inside it okay as so

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,480
as I mentioned we are all part of an

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,950
ecosystem it's it's really it's in our

00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,480
best interest to have as many people

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:02,900
that are have this mentality as possible

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:06,230
and because the more people the more

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,060
easier life would be the more better

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,530
will be for communities and more open

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,230
source and for your software we're going

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,810
to have and whatever goals we have at at

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,790
individual or collective or or company

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,580
level more people that talk about what

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,700
we do it's better for everyone again we

00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,010
tend to forget this because we are busy

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,840
and because the industry has gone so far

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,210
like we heard about Microsoft that

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,200
bought github for I don't know how man

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:35,860
how many millions or trillions I don't

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,840
know how much was it billions of dollars

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,550
and it's it's going big like um like the

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,140
value of open-source products now it's

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,700
quite big and this is very nice but we

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,150
are again we need to talk about the

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,040
basics once in a once in a while and

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,840
talking about you know advocacy and

00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,820
ethics in general it's not very pleasant

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:01,340
especially in the morning or in a sunny

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:03,020
day but you know again it's good for for

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,850
everyone every everyone's business

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,320
so some there are some people that have

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:12,980
done this before I think in people that

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,720
do full-time advocacy usually are some

00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,280
of them you know do get burned out

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,950
because you need to sacrifice a lot a

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,830
lot of your your personal time a lot of

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,210
your personal family time and stuff like

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,880
that so you need to be a very tough

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,070
character to do it but also they give an

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,380
example to other people to do smaller

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,130
things maybe but they have also that

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,800
they're also have an impact on what what

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,250
we are all are doing they're good I

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,510
think we should also some people think

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,640
these examples are good some people

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,100
things are bad it depends on our point

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,780
of view or how we see those

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:54,980
so Jimmy Wales the fan of Wikimedia

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:57,170
Foundation I think is a good good case

00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,390
of advocacy in general there I don't

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,310
know many people that you know say he's

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,130
done some bad things although I think

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,880
he's now not that much into the

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,590
Wikimedia movement as he was before also

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,560
a good example of probably he got burned

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,850
out I don't know I don't know him much

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,290
but I think he's a good example in the

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,300
end of the day of doing something with

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:26,090
passion for a lot of time and having

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:30,140
quite an impact which s Thaman so very

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:34,490
very good advocacy guy in my in my

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,290
perception somebody my friend over there

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,200
told me that he's gonna be in an event

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,240
so I'm only you know imagining how you

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,650
know handling him and you know going

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,540
around with him and cetera et cetera but

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:51,500
a very good advocacy person you know

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:54,530
it's it's very rare to see people that

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,750
started doing this like 30 years ago and

00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:01,430
still doing it which means Commission

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:03,710
they are committed to their cause but

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,510
with talent come there there are some

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:10,790
there is also some back package with it

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:13,250
okay Edward Snowden in general we should

00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,180
I think we should jet people after a

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,890
while but there is a general except if

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,450
you are working in me in the US

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,190
administration in some parts of it

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,870
you're probably gonna think he's not a

00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,270
good good advocacy guys in private

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,180
privacy but I think the majority of

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,310
people that are not only us but other

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,800
people think that we it's it's a very

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:38,120
good case of advocacy with a lot of

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,550
personal cost and also it was I think

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,690
the impact that he had it had in a very

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,030
short period of time

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,040
it was huge you could have people that

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,630
had no idea about you know privacy and

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,890
talking about you know

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,610
massive surveillance and stuff like that

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:57,070
you had many popular magazines talking

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,430
about these things as well because of

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,370
him

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:03,340
leanest ervil's there is something going

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,220
on with the linux things very I think

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,410
very good that Volga sea guy but again

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,080
it's one of these cases that when you it

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,790
depends when you who you ask and if

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,650
they're bothered from you know bad

00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:19,300
language and stuff like that or you know

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:22,330
showing fingers in public but again I

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,630
think it he has quite a good impact on

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:31,840
on the linux scene and free and open

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:34,090
source movement as well so we're working

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,160
where we can advocate i think it's

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,770
simple they're like students are the

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,980
best in my in my perception from from my

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,170
experience in my city the city where

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,860
based right now students are the base

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:49,900
case scenario although in countries like

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,430
Albania a lot of we have this brain

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,620
drain a lot of people leave the country

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,660
so they get exposed to the whole culture

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,920
and they leave the country hopefully

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,540
they're gonna come back but in general

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,550
students are because they've not been

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:09,220
contaminated yet by this whole you know

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:11,470
life achievement midlife crisis all the

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,920
in having a mortgage and all this stuff

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,440
that people have these days universities

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,860
are a tough thing to advocate because

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,420
our very it depends also on each country

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,260
again I'm talking about of my personal

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,720
experience is this on the record it is

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,880
we are recording this okay I cannot talk

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,690
more about the you know people on

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,340
Albanian universities on the record but

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,290
instead of it's not an easy to advocate

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,430
there it's very complicated very

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:46,420
bureaucratic but we need to do it home

00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,780
users again it's very small scale

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,310
usually it's your aunt which gonna

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,930
bother with all this stuff and it I

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,270
don't know if it's a good case scenario

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,790
but there are also people that are into

00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:02,100
it for example I have my my family

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:05,080
members that you now use Linux

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,950
and they're not because my advocacy but

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,540
because it's easier for them to use it

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,890
another tough one but again it depends

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,030
on the government or where you are

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:18,360
talking are the public institutions and

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:23,590
in in Albania we've done we've managed

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,210
to do through a lot of you know a lot of

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,920
meetings and a lot of talks and also

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,950
events where we invite a lot of letters

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,720
sent to the public institutions we we've

00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,540
managed along with the respective

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,130
organizations to to switch to it to

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,680
convince the municipality of Tirana to

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,590
switch from a proprietary software to

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,150
next cloud they're also using in 85

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,840
percent of the computers there are

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,480
LibreOffice right now and also they have

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,830
Moodle which is something about an open

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,850
source I've never used it's open source

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:57,010
software about trainings and they're

00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,190
there there are talks for them to switch

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,890
to Linux gradually at some point so it's

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,680
a very good case study and in if you

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,410
want to do advocacy there again in my

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,080
experience you just need to need to to

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,210
go institutionally first probably gonna

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,100
take a while and after that if it

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,660
doesn't work you need to talk to key

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,040
people that are in this situation in

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,990
order to convince them and explain them

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,810
why they should switch from one system

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,510
to the other and of course I'm more

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,460
happy to to talk over coffee after if

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,600
there is any other place that I've

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:37,800
forgot where we can advocate so where to

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:44,230
do it how much time do we have

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:47,260
okay are you Germans we can we take this

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:51,070
longer no okay okay so where to do it

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:54,010
there are two levels third types so that

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,720
two levels macro and micro macro usually

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,510
means international but not always and

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,170
micro it's the local level which I

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:07,630
personally like more in a lot so let's

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:09,400
go first macro usually all the Linux or

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,880
free software advocacy groups usually

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,770
they go to one place which is the

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,740
European Parliament they have a lot of

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,820
meetings

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:22,360
costs a lot and usually it's you are

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:29,600
against people that have lot of budgets

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:31,430
to lobby right but there are some

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,420
organizations Research Foundation one of

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,170
them and I'm pretty sure

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,780
Adri EDR E is another one which are

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,140
focused in changing policies at the

00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,150
European Union level in in Albania in

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,350
Tirana we also run this campaign public

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,190
money public code where we try to

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,800
contact public officials to explain to

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,100
them officially why why this is

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,470
important for for public institutions to

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,440
have infrastructure open source

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:03,730
infrastructure because it should be and

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,730
it's the right way to do it

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:12,230
controversial Linux Foundation also it's

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:17,150
a group that aims to do advocacy at a

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,260
macro level so industry-wide and again

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,450
there are people I know that they are

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,560
quite positive about it other people are

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:26,750
not but in general there are the general

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,390
ideas that want to have an impact and

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,860
not have advocacy at a macro level and

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,630
of course it's very important to have

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,580
our own media for example I read this

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,220
blog it's called its force it has news

00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,630
and updates about free and open source

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,060
software in general but there are also

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:49,700
other blogs and news in technology that

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:51,980
are quite quite representing and doing a

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:58,580
lot of good advocacy in in an

00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:01,940
international level as well of course at

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:07,640
conferences just like an companies are a

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,320
good way to go and talk and we also need

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,480
to do a lot of you know in order to

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,160
support local events or local events

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,370
like this we also need to do advocacy to

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,730
big companies that have an interest in

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,120
supporting conferences open source and

00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,040
free software companies like this one

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,660
again there are also some great

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,510
initiatives that help young people

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:35,540
or people that have just started in this

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:38,990
industry understand why it's quite

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,370
important we just launched a microsite

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,300
called what can I do for labor office

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,280
which is a fork of what can I do for

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,460
Mozilla which is a fork of what can I do

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,170
for fedora and this is another one where

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,630
and it's it's a nice case study I think

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:59,210
of you know people sharing code and also

00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:03,110
helping people other people you know get

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:06,140
into our movement this helps people with

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,880
some simple questions understand how

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,420
they can get involved in the brofist for

00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,440
example or in other initiatives as well

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:17,270
this is the Italian version there is

00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:20,780
also in it's also in English and other

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:25,400
languages okay so my micro level because

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,990
we have only few minutes left okay so I

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,680
mentioned before open labs hackerspace

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,150
it's it's the local initiatives

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,110
hackerspaces there are some good ones I

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:38,060
think I would totally totally hang out

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,650
and see and it's there these are very

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,120
good hubs of people meeting each other

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,820
and talking about this kind of stuff is

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,360
kind of stuff in Tirana has helped a lot

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,220
local conference conferences are I have

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,710
also this kind of spirit of you know

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:54,260
having a community and people care for

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,970
each other a lot usually there are no a

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,970
few companies they're sponsoring them so

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:02,270
I think if you want them to keep on we

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,250
need to to support this kind of

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,560
initiatives either without with you know

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,089
if we are into a company and sponsoring

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,280
them but also if you talk to these

00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:14,360
events you have no idea how much

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,810
inspiration youngsters in this local

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,199
events get out of this conferences so as

00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,150
I'm ops sermons mention organize events

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,180
in conference at a local level smaller

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,210
events hackathons or meetups even for

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,790
three or four people are quite nice and

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,640
very important if you invite influential

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:37,100
people that might need to be advocated

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,620
in what we're doing we every year in our

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,830
conference which sent a lot of letters

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,430
through any kind of public institutions

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,810
sometimes they come

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,670
time's it done but they are a reminder

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,080
that we are out there and what we're

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,520
doing doesn't cost anything to send

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,650
letters to these people you just change

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,340
the name you know and the name of the

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,470
institution and just post them well if

00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,570
it's Albanian post-its and usually goes

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,190
it's not very good so some letters might

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,590
get lost which was our experience but

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,350
that's another talk we can have over a

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,390
beer or coffee okay and this is an

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,130
outcome we had I mentioned that we had

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:14,240
an agreement with the municipality to do

00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,160
a lot of open source stuff and these are

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,690
these are five very confused people that

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,970
haven't done this before as you can see

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,710
do not know how to dress officially and

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,690
this is the mayor of Tirana signing the

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,480
agreement which is a very good outcome

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,100
of you know inviting these people to our

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,460
events letting them know what we're

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,990
doing a lot of meetings we are a

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,030
Mediterranean country which means that

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,190
there's you can you have to do stuff in

00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:42,740
the coffee shop otherwise nothing gets

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,940
done etc etc so I don't know if you saw

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,340
have seen the Shawshank Redemption

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,040
Redemption when the guy wanted to have a

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,930
library in the prison it's not a spoiler

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,150
alert for people that haven't seen it

00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:57,680
but in general people in public

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,540
institutions are very they have their

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,010
own agenda so if they don't answer we've

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,420
just brought them again and again again

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,940
until they get bored and say who are

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:08,930
these guys let's have a meeting over

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,110
coffee okay I know a really important to

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:15,620
understand what's their incentive and

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:19,210
what they want in what there are usually

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:21,380
these people need something in this case

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,850
it's very good publicity for the

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,500
municipality it's your honor so we've go

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,990
to every conference and we like we

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,150
mention them so also they go to

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,750
different events and say hey we did this

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,700
this and that

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,720
so it's a win-win situation for all the

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:40,670
involved parties right so some last

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:44,720
thoughts there is last slide there is a

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:47,900
promise there is the last if you if you

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,990
do the research about whatever we each

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,880
of you are up to you're gonna see that

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,680
there is quite there are gonna be a lot

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,809
of active communities in some countries

00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,610
and none in other countries

00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:03,890
and the potential there is like quite

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:07,070
big for example I don't know you know

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,260
Africa probably for logistical issues

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,670
because very hard to go there it doesn't

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,070
have a lot of free and open-source

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:17,630
enthusiasts right now but the potential

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:20,570
there is huge some Asian countries you

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,040
know there are there are countries but

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,540
if you go and visit them they're going

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,790
to have so many gonna see so much

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,740
potential and even if you like we start

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,870
talking like online is going to be also

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,840
very good it's very important to think

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,730
long term I know it's tough I mentioned

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,900
you know mortgage we're busy we're

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,690
families but if we don't think long term

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,809
nothing is going to work I mean in my

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,120
perception start a community in a coffee

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,070
shop in a hackerspace in CDs that there

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,920
do not have anything even though there

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,920
are five people I think the potential

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,520
there is huge I've seen this happen six

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,800
years ago and I think it's it's quite

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,120
important to talk to local small

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:07,130
communities small cities about this and

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,520
some Airport books read some Airport

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,990
books like The Tao of coaching which is

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,500
about business but in general also

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:18,020
applies to communities as well and last

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,510
but not least agree on some main values

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,630
of the community or starting from day

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,980
one values I think are more important

00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,570
than having budgets or you know having

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,059
sponsors for a conference or event or

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:36,640
anything else like that because it's

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:39,110
gonna spare you a lot of time fighting

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,220
if you have one pillar and say hey we

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:45,559
agree to do only this and we will not

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,450
diversify I think it makes the life

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:52,160
easier for everyone that is involved in

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,559
this kind of communities and yeah that's

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,850
it it's it's a tough process advocacy

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,100
it's you know you need to do it on your

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,080
spare time that's why there's a lot of

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,850
money in lobbying in the US Google

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,419
spends a lot of money Google started

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:08,179
three years ago I think one division in

00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,480
home like not outsourcing it only for

00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:11,090
lobbying in the U we

00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,360
means that it's very very important and

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:20,309
we just need to do the same with zero

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,870
budget or less budget in a at different

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:24,000
levels because again it's very good for

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,770
its one of us for our companies for our

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,350
institutions and for you know our

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,790
communities so thanks a lot if you're

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:38,250
there any questions or if we have time

00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:39,250
for questions okay I'm gonna be around

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:46,279
so if you have a name

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:46,279
