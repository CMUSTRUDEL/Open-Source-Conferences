cool all right um yeah thanks everyone

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,640
for joining

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,080
um we're doing a session two of the end

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
of year results

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,799
uh survey and uh i have a few slides to

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,320
kind of get this started

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,680
um does anyone from anyone want to say

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
anything before i start

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,760
uh i know uh axel used to look up last

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,160
week

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,160
um maybe carol can you say something

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,920
nothing super super important i mean

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
apart from

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,399
i think this is a thanking everyone for

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,520
for joining um and and helping with that

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,200
because i think this

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
this is one of those opportunities where

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,640
we can get together

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,039
um and it's it's less individuals who

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,160
are

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,160
pushing things but we we can look into

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,239
ways where

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
can we drive initiatives together so

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,600
that it's not just doug

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,039
or adrienne or axel or

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
driving something but is there some

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,560
things we can pick and

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:12,400
put more focus on um as

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,320
as a team or as teams

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
yeah and i'd like to say something real

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,320
quick uh

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
as well uh so i'm sorry that i missed

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,040
the last one it overlapped with the

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,400
um a katy wayland sprint thing so i

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
didn't get to join but

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
i'm really happy that we're doing this

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
kind of thing to try to see how we can

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
make

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,439
uh you know open souza more well-known

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,079
and and to grow and become a better

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,079
community

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,840
on the ongoing basis so this is

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,320
something i'm really happy that we're

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,320
doing excellent

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,520
so i'd like to climb in guys if i may

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,960
sure um i

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,320
i had a thought after last uh

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,159
our last chat and

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,159
there's obviously come up before but

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,399
in terms of open sourcer

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:14,400
we sit here as part of the project

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,400
um and i wonder to what extent we really

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,160
should be reaching out to what i think

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
of as the community

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,400
meaning those guys who are just

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,280
plain old users

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
and i think they have a huge part to

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,959
play

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,239
and a very symbiotic part to play

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
in the success of the the whole open

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,760
susa what i would like to call the

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,599
phenomenon

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,640
um and

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
what struck me was when we were talking

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,120
um it was just a small group of guys

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,239
talking about the project

00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,159
and i was thinking there must be

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,080
thousands of users who

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,360
don't do anything other than download

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,920
the distro

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,159
run and go and uh i i feel that

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,959
at some point we really should discuss

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,840
more about how to bring those guys

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
into the fold or at least get them um

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,319
some

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
maybe uh recognition may not be the

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,720
right word but

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,599
uh at least get them enthused about the

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
project

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,959
in general um i i just

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
sense there's some a small disconnect

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,560
there

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
that's it that's my i'm i'm going to get

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
off my soapbox now

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
all right well thanks for speaking up

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
and um

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,599
in the chat i just kind of posted where

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
the slides are um

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,599
if you want to access those but um i'll

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,159
just

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
i mean the idea is um just sort of i'm

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,000
going to go over the first few slides

00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,680
to kind of set some expectations i guess

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,519
and explain kind of what we're

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,840
going to uh go over um so this week

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,720
uh follow on as a follow-on to last week

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
we're gonna

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
look at um tools driving switchers to

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,760
open souza

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
uh tools and reasons why people switch

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,720
to open souza

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,720
flagship was mentioned in discussion we

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,840
can go over and talk about this and

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,680
and see how we want to view

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,520
um the multiple distributions and

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
the other projects that we have within

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
opensuse and like how we

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,400
might consider marketing that

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,360
um and then i have

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
improved demographics and expanding

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
global users and that that's

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,080
uh they're sort of like lumped together

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
in the slides

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
um but uh there's a there's a difference

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,759
there and too

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,960
in both of those and i also had a few uh

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,600
things that i looked at before we

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,800
started the

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,280
meetup that would go over

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
some just some more informative

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,160
analytics that i grabbed from the

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,080
website

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,560
so um for today

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,479
and just the same as last week you know

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,840
these sort of the

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
ideas and say ground rules or whatever

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,800
um

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,400
that we want to want to have here so

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
just everyone you know you're a part of

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
this as well

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
you could you could just simply listen

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,199
the whole time or you can provide

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,160
input um and we hope to put those

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
ideas into action um to to better

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
improve the project

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
and just you know we can consider it

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
respectful

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,960
of one another's opinions and um

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,320
yep that's all i want to say with that

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,919
so we can go into um in the switchers

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,039
and when we go into switchers um

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,520
this was talked about uh adrian

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,960
speak up if you want a little bit more

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,280
to expand on that but

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
it was a topic that was brought up where

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,400
if you look at

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,039
our people that are using

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,440
um using linux it's

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,560
you know we're looking at a good portion

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,240
um that are over

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,520
the 10 years but if you look at about 40

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,280
really are under five years so

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,319
um that's a significant portion and we

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,120
would want to i believe grow that

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
and make those sort of more compatible

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
it's great that we have the

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,400
you know that we have the tenure plus

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,600
people um

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,360
but obviously that's um

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
you know we want to grow those other

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,599
areas because those people that are

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
in the 10-year i mean they're they're

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,039
they're already sold they're going to be

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,800
using it

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,080
they're comfortable with it and then

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,520
with switching

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,680
of servers um you know we

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,199
we see most are coming from other linux

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,240
distributions

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,520
um and you know maybe a quarter

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,160
right are coming from windows but uh it

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
is um

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
it is an interesting factor when you see

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
that transition

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,720
sort of the next slide i kind of break

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,800
down uh what are the

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
uh what are the distributions where

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,680
they're coming from i think we

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,280
i'm not sure if i showed this last week

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
or not but um

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,919
ubuntu is is the biggest there um i did

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
and basically i took the comments

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,000
section there was a um

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:52,319
an option to do that uh from the

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,319
uh stats or from the from that question

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,520
so you really counted all the the

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
different answers

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
for that particular one yeah i mean

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
there were only two that i could

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
um but these ones i yes with this i

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,560
ended up

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,080
doing like a tablet and um

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
yeah so most are coming from ubuntu but

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,199
we could probably

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,720
expect that since that's usually an

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
entry point into linux for a lot of

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,879
people

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,199
um which my my personal feelings about

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,080
this

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,080
are that uh you know we we've long

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
felt that um

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,200
you know competing with ubuntu is not

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
necessarily something we would wanted to

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
do

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,640
and we said well let you know they'll

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120


00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
i mean they'll find us right um or

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
they'll eventually

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,240
move on or expand or whatever or you

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
know they'll go to a different

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,200
distribution

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
but you'll get a lot of entry point

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,000
people i think using ubuntu

00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,480
anyone have any comments or

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
yeah um i think this is

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,959
so i think this is actually um

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
sort of an indicator that if we did

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
actually put a

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,399
slight bit more focus on

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,320
on being accessible at the entry point

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
for for people to linux in the first

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,839
place

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,440
we would be a lot more successful

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,120
because if

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
by a fair margin the majority of

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,920
switchers are coming from

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,399
ubuntu then and

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
and the assumption being that they're

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,560
semi-satisfied here

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
then that means that this is saying that

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,880
if we did a little bit more to cater to

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
the same kind of market that ubuntu does

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,399
there's there's a whole there's just a

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,399
minor jump there

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
that can be skipped and people can come

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
just straight to us

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,120
so like i feel like that what that says

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,320
is that

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,200
we should think about where

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,200
people choose ubuntu and what what are

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,640
our weaknesses to make us better

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
in that respect

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
anyone else want to comment all about

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
that

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
oh by the way um so i just posted the

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,680
ether pad so we could probably

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,560
everyone can collectively put in minutes

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
there um

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:34,000
and comments

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,079
well if if i understand this correctly

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
there could be a different way and that

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,480
is

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,480
focus on

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
some other areas

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,000
then then the ubuntu is strong or punto

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,000
is winning

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
i mean the decisive factor that will

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,959
adjudicate between

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,120
your interpretation geralt and niels

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,560
is how much time people have spent on

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,480
ubuntu

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,920
if they have spent a lot of time that

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
means

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,000
it's rather your interpretation and if

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,640
they have spent

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,720
little time and they they are still they

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,360
still qualify as new users

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,760
then it's rather neil's interpretation

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,000
so

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,720
as far as i'm concerned i think both

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,040
interpretation is actually um

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
uh they're compatible in the sense that

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,040
we can

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,240
cater for both groups of users

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,320
simultaneously

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,160
provided we provided we we don't fail

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,720
with basic stuff such as

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
discovery of the images installation

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,880
process

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,680
documentation so i think i think we

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,600
don't need

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,160
to totally diverge in terms of strategy

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,680
just depending on whether we agree with

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,480
one or the other interpretation

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
it and i would just say from a marketing

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,560
perspective

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,600
um it's rather difficult

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,800
because ubuntu does get a lot of love

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,399
particularly from media in general

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,920
um why that is versus all these other

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,959
distributions that are out there i mean

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,079
that's kind of

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,360
hard to uh identify but

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,320
um they very clearly get a lot of

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
attention

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,800
regardless and at any point in which

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
they do something

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,920
they get attention and people write

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,200
about it

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,279
and i know having

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,120
spoken with a few people that work it

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
had worked at ubuntu you know they were

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
really

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,079
their effectiveness effectiveness really

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
was that mark

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,959
pushed them to blog and which we know

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,519
from last week you know blogging is

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,200
going to get

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,880
more attention so um that is

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,839
an area where we could potentially

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,519
place focus on um just having more

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,160
people in the community blog about

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,480
open susan what they might be doing or

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
what's new or

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,279
something that effect yeah i mean the

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,720
the one of the one of the challenges

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,639
like that i've personally had advocating

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
for open souza over the past five years

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
that i've been part of the project

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,920
is that i don't know what i can talk

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,800
about to bring up openstar

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,240
reasonably in conversation with people

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,480
because

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,680
uh saying the same thing over and over

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,800
again bores people and so being able to

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,560
have something fresh to discuss

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
basically every time that there's a

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,480
potential avenue to talk about obusa

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,720
makes it a lot easier to

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,560
to bring to to boost opensuses mindshare

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,839
this is the same strategy i've often

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
used when

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,760
talking about fedora when i'm working

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
the context of the fedora project

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
and i think that that's been very

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,320
successful being able to have

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,320
something to talk about all the time

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,079
that that shows that there is something

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
going on in the open souza project

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,880
i mean i think the two sorry you go

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,680
ahead

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
first no please please i'm just typing

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,079
so

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,519
go ahead okay um the the the two flavors

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,959
of of user here and i

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
uh we i think we lose ground in two

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,720
different

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,000
areas um if i can talk about the sort of

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
um

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
if for with without sounding

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,800
condescending that the higher

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,720
area whenever you try and spin up a bps

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
or you want to start a project or

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,199
something

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,560
and you go to a provider

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,560
everybody's got ubuntu

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,680
most people have centos um

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,320
and finding people with

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,440
susa is open source is actually quite

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,760
difficult

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,760
and then when you do find someone

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
finding someone who's got a distribution

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,399
that

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,839
you can just click and run um

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,959
that's not one or two generations older

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,240
the vast majority of places uh

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,839
well i don't know about the vast

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
majority but a lot of places still

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,199
offering opensuse

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,720
15.1 um some of them are even offering

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,000
uh the old sort of um uh

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,040
um you know 11 or something stupid like

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,279
that

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
so that's that's one side of thing uh

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,160
one side of uh

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,000
the game if you like that

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,360
if we can reach out to the

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,320
um to the the server vendors

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
as it were to make it make it a viable

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,639
or

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,079
not viable but a more popular distro

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,839
to put out there that would deal with

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,880
the sort of uh the developers and the

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,560
admins and

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,040
those sorts of people the other side of

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,600
it

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
i think comes down to the people who

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,360
want to

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,360
want to try it out

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,320
and that's going to be really quite hard

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,519
i think because

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,279
the mindset is all ubuntu anything

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,880
uh you know that the first tool that

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,320
anybody does uh

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,320
uses is google so if you say google i

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,600
want to try linux

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:42,720
uh it's gonna come back with ubuntu

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,720
so somehow um

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,480
uh we've got to be more present there

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,880
and blogging obviously works because it

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,920
it gets more google results

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,959
but i do think we should look at this

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,839
as a two-pronged approach uh

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,360
one being on the server side the other

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
one being on the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
the new user the desktop replacement

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,720
side of things

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,880
um those are my thoughts on that

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,839
well with the the on the first prong

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,160
that you mentioned with

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,439
you know having it on servers and vpss

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
and stuff

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,480
i i actually i completely agree with it

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,600
i i think that the lack of availability

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,919
of open sousa in virtually everywhere i

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,880
think

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,880
off hand i only know of two places where

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,120
i can actually get opensuse

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,480
for server but also

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,679
there's a stunning lack of confidence

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,200
in opensuse on the desktop as well which

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,520
is

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,760
incongruent with how well opensuse

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,679
itself does work on the desktop

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,440
uh and ever since what mid last year or

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
something like that

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
where linux distributions have been

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
showing up

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,000
on computers people have been asking

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
over and over again why why aren't we

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,600
there and that's a

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,240
that's a um it's a difficult thing to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
solve

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
i don't i don't know what what we can do

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,160
there

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,559
without relationships that we don't have

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,559
right now

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
is it possible for somebody to like

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,840
reach out to lenovo you know

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
i know that you know neil the fedora

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,360
team you you helped work with that

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
um getting fedora onto

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
their machines oem were you not a part

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,840
of that

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,280
or at least i was i was part of the

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
some of the bring up work but the

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,360
initial contact

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
was done through red hat and lenovo uh

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,080
red hat's desktop team in lenovo

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
engineering

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
um okay but i helped i helped a little

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
bit with the actual work to make it

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
possible

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
but i wasn't part of the i wasn't part

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,720
of the initial relationship starting

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,039
um alas i don't really have contacts

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
in in that particular space to make

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,840
something like that happen

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,960
i mean obviously you know the the code

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,280
has been broken

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,280
by somebody and there's interest already

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,760
in oem manufacturers

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,880
so i wonder i mean it's got to be a lot

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,880
easier to

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,799
add opensuse than it would be to add

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
linux i would think

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
and we're talking about as a as a

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,200
product leap

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,679
is flipping awesome i mean right right

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
now it is it is such a good product

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,880
at this point i have no problem pushing

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,919
someone toward leap

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,640
um for for a desktop usage

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,640
and so i i don't see what the i guess i

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
kind of don't see

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
it's not a hard sell because it is a

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,799
good product it's not about selling it

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
it's about relationships and

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
at least from within the context of the

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,360
open souza project i know of basically

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,559
nobody

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,000
with any relationships with major oems i

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,240
know that susa for

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,760
historical reasons has a relationship

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,039
with hewlett-packard and hewlett-packard

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,919
enterprise

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,039
but that doesn't help me or anyone else

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
in the open souza project

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,520
yeah so there's two factors one is it's

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,960
actually

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,000
more work than you would think um

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,200
suse has been has been doing that

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,840
among others with hp um

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,320
doing desktop preloads notebook preloads

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,760
and and

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
we're not talking about a couple of

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
hours of a couple of volunteers per week

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
this is this is

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,799
really significant um

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,080
and the other the other element that i'm

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,280
seeing is in most

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,320
cases most hardware vendors or cloud

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,320
service providers for most use cases

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,480
are very happy to just have two linux

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,520
vendors

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
um so for example i don't think lenovo

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,679
and

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,320
it's actually been tried

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,000
um by some colleagues i don't think

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,720
lenovo is very realistic

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
because there is ubuntu as we discussed

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,880
earlier

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,720
and there is the specific ongoing

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,640
relationship with with fedora so adding

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,480
i you're totally right in terms of

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,600
drivers and and other infrastructure

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
it's a lot easier when linux as such is

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
already

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,760
enabled but but still

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,840
the the interest of adding more and more

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
variety there is cost associated with

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,520
that for

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,360
for those vendors and so

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,919
the primary reason they will do that if

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,080
is if there is demand

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,960
you know and that's where the snake

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,520
bites its tail

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
obviously

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,280
yeah um so and then and that's basically

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
why i didn't want to focus too

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,919
as gerald so that's pretty much the

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
reason why i didn't want to focus too

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,000
hard on

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,360
on lenovo as a specific option because

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
the dual vendor thing is

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,320
the dual supplier thing is basically

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,000
most oem's limit

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
right now right now i

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
honestly if we were to do this if we

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
were going to try to do this hewlett

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,559
packard would be our best shot because

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,039
they're not doing anything right now

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
with

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,960
with linux and and

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
it is an option and a way to be kind of

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,919
competitive

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,200
um but i don't have a relationship with

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,320
them i don't know anybody at

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
hewlett-packard

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,559
and that makes that extremely difficult

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
to us to even start that conversation

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
you know there's another point too where

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,760
attila kind of mentions there is like

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
digitalocean right we've been trying for

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,960
years to get this

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,360
um to to get opensuse on that

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,200
and i mean lenode's been you know we've

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,039
worked with them they're they're great

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
um they're they're really you know

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,919
they've been around for a long time and

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,600
they're

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,400
they they know where the

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,679
audience is in the community you know so

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
um

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,120
but yeah some of these um some of some

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,880
people just

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,960
some companies really just don't

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,240
necessarily play alone

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
or it's not in their interest um

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,600
but the only way we can change that is

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,039
by

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,720
trying to be vocal um

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,000
or come up with some plan that we can

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,240
all kind of agree and

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
um

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,799
yeah the the

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,919
the strongest lever would be

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,159
um demand

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,159
you know if say school districts were to

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
were to start purchases purchasing

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
notebooks and they would

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,960
be asking for open source or more

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
companies or whatever and that's

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,000
obviously not easy to get

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,440
but that's the from my work with vendors

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,039
that's the argument that's

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,720
always the most convincing

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,880
yeah i mean that's how fedora wound up

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
being on laptops was

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,480
on lenovo laptops and other vendor

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,760
laptops is that their customers

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,880
kept asking for it so

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,000
um at some point uh one of the lenovo

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,640
folks working in in the linux

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,799
uh in the in the linux laptop division

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,559
that was handling rel and whatnot

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,080
uh was actually became was a member of

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,960
the fedora community and

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,240
when the request started coming in they

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,279
were able to pivot to

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,559
actually make it happen and that's

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,600
that's sort of how that started um

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,640
i don't know if that is actually an av

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,760
i don't know if that would that kind of

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,679
happy coincidence would happen in

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,200
in in our world but as gerald said like

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,320
adding demand and adding

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,480
interest can make a whole lot of other

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,840
things start magically happening

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
um because people who are motivated and

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,240
interested

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:12,000
and and want to drive the success of the

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,799
of the community and the platform will

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,679
just sort of make things happen as it

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,960
goes along

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,159
and so i think that that is

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,200
something that's going to be one of

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,840
those mid-term kind of

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,880
things that will resolve itself over

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,000
time

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,280
we do have a big mindset issue

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,440
to overcome um

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,480
[Music]

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,320
just uh going back to

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,960
my own experiences i had

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,960
quite a difficult conversation with um

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,960
with with my son who for his sins has

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,840
followed

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:59,600
me his father into the industry and

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,720
um the organization he works for

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,000
um first of all gave him

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,840
he he administers linux systems

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,880
but they wouldn't let him have a linux

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,480
workstation

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,559
which is mental um he then kicked up a

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,760
load of fuss about it

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,480
and um the organization that he works

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,520
for

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,000
uh basically said to you you can't

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,080
because

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,960
we have to have a certified system

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,679
for whatever reason and they seem to

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
think that

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,880
windows was certified and linux wasn't

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,240
uh despite the fact that um

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,320
you know they were using predominantly

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,120
linux servers in

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,520
on the on their back end but then what

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,720
tends to happen is you get people in hr

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,440
or petty managers or administrators who

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,500
don't really understand this

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,080
after kicking up a lot of us

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,279
[Music]

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,559
he was allowed to get linux

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:12,080
but they insisted that he used red hat

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,440
because they they knew that it was

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,559
certified and and you know

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,000
it just became so hard

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,919
that in the end he basically he

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,440
just ran uh he he just ran

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,279
his uh he just ran a vm inside whatever

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,320
they gave him

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,770
um there are some real obstacles

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,640
there um

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,559
[Music]

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
don't know how to get over there that

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,559
particular obstacle that you mentioned

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
would actually be easier for us to solve

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,039
than all the other ones we've been

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
talking about

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:53,679
because we can

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,960
say things that uh

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,520
because of the relationship between

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,679
opensuse leap and susa linux enterprise

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,080
that that can make those kinds of

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,919
enterprises more comfortable with it

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,600
that being said uh

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
we don't have any marketing right now

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
built around that and that's something

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
that we're going to have to start

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,200
figuring out

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,760
as we ramp up open source elite 15.3

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,559
so so that is something to keep in mind

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,679
for those

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,720
for those specific use cases

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,279
yep one thing um on this

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,919
whole uh coming back we're switching

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,640
here from

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,240
if you like from the the back back

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,520
office to front office

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,600
again um the

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
there is the perception between

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
tumbleweed and leap

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,520
i think uh there is a perception that

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,840
tumbleweed is

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,880
uh particularly you know for geeks

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,919
versus leap is your go-to platform

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,440
now uh i'll put my hand up here is

00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,520
i don't run tumbleweed at all because

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,279
um i i really don't like surprises

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:09,279
in what i do uh because i

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,960
my entire production runs on opensuse

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:16,159
absolutely but the

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,360
issue with leap being so closely tied

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,559
with sleeve is that

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,159
there is there there are a lot of

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,440
program versions on the desktop that are

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,320
compared to uh if you one would say

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,840
compared to ubuntu and people are

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,279
absolutely

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,600
antique a really good example of that

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,640
was

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,919
one that i had to deal with today which

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,679
was

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,399
an next cloud desktop and

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,320
the version the version available

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,679
through zipper

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,960
is actually probably

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,960
well over a year old

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,640
um which is a lifetime in in

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:07,760
in this game so i don't know how

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,760
i'm sorry i'm sorry

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:21,679
you know plan b flat pack bang

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:24,480
done uh oh sorry app image

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,200
in that particular case but uh i use an

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,640
awful lot

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:33,279
of app images and flat pack image

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,200
images where

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,039
where the same programs are available in

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:41,279
zipper

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,440
simply because the zipper versions are

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,240
a little bit too intolerably out of date

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,240
at least for leap

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,679
i'm done so yeah maybe what we should

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,039
stress a little bit more is the

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,320
long-term support

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:01,360
character of leap what what that

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,640
that is it basically i mean other like

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
fedora or ubuntu they're doing half

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,640
yearly

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,480
releases of new uh distributions whereas

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,000
we are doing it just on a

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,200
on an annual basis basically and

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,080
and this gives uh

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,600
yeah the the long-term stability and

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,720
given the fact that slee

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,480
itself is a kind of long-term support

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,279
thing i mean they're supporting i think

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,240
leap 15

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,360
until 2028 or something like that i i

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,399
don't have the

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
the exact schedule in mind but we should

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,559
really stress

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,919
leap is the long-term support version

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,000
and if you want to really have

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,799
up-to-date software go the tumbleweed

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,919
way

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,320
i mean i i completely agree with arias i

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,200
have

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,120
one system a desktop over here running

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,480
with leap 15.2 and you

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,200
can't use kmail on that

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,080
because it there is a bug in it that

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,799
sucks up all the cpu power and

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,880
it's not ending with with downloading

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,679
the imap servers and something like that

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,399
it is a known bug but nobody has a as a

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,600
resolution for it so far

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:18,720
so i think i think that's

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:21,120
true um so i think you know the

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,880
currency of some packages is is

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,600
certainly a question

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,480
funny enough none of those two that you

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,679
mentioned

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,200
um next cloud and kde

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,240
kmale are part of suse linux enterprise

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,320
so the reason they are older or if if

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,279
they and probably many others are older

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,519
in leap

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,720
that has nothing to do with suse linux

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,480
enterprise

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,519
but just how we as open source

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,919
add things on on top so

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,440
that means there is an opportunity for

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,559
us to change

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
how we go about such things right i was

00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,240
i was actually going to say the same

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,080
thing

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,799
because most people who complain about

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,240
leap

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,559
software even in in the opensuse discord

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,679
they're not using the gnome desktop

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,519
basically

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,919
very few people recommend the gnome

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,320
desktop for various reasons

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,519
and so the out-of-date-ness of leap on

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,880
on on for kde or any of the other

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
community desktops and any of the

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,880
software built on that

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,360
is purely a question of whether or not

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,399
we want to suffer through our own

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,240
update process to to push them out

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,240
i know that from my perspective i

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,000
maintain some software in leap

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,159
and i i don't like updating software and

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,039
leap because the process is too painful

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,320
um this is something we should probably

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,519
take a closer look at

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,640
and try to improve because that could

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,120
have very nice effects for

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,159
uh for leap users and make it a lot more

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,760
attractive as a platform

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,080
i i i agree with that i mean i've

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,799
a couple of packages that i maintain

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,279
myself

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,560
and had some various discussions with

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,679
the maintenance team

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,320
why a version bump of certain packages

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,159
was justified or was not justified and

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,000
in general the maintenance team really

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,599
focuses on the stability

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,599
and they're not really happy to have a

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,520
version bump inside

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,919
uh in inside one release

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,280
right maybe this is something that we

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,000
that we need to discuss within the

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,919
opensuse community

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,480
um my opinion is a little different

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:45,760
because i think we already have

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
a lot of um

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,560
clips or things that other distro

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,079
haven't such as bcr

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:02,320
fs and snapshot is a standard

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:05,680
for us other distro

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,800
and this way to make

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,640
much more security um

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,040
in my opinion i would like to

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:19,359
try to make something similar

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,560
marketing i don't know if he's a real

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,839
marketing

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,839
all of us have to make um

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,480
little video or

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,599
open a single blog or

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,599
explain in

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,280
our community how is simple to use

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:49,040
in a specific way for example i mean

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,640
i'm an expert of multimedia i explain

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,760
in my community how is simple to set up

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,680
operations for multimedia if

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,200
another user is an expert

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,040
for ip he explain

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:11,280
how user opens user for ikey and

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:14,079
is simple if we can have a

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,400
collect of this information and make a

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,000
lot of

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,760
information inside the web

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,960
i think when we try to search

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,920
something secured linux inside the

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,960
google

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
wow we can

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:39,200
find opensuse in the third position

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,880
wow it is my idea to make

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,079
a bit of more information about opensuse

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,280
because we have a lot of things

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,560
i'm not um to think

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,960
i'm not think what we have because

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,640
we have a lot of good things and this is

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,160
a

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:09,839
a good way to explain because i'm use

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:12,079
or we are using open susan

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,079
um

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,640
so i guess we can kind of probably move

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
into the

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,400
this flagship discussion we're kind of

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,839
already in it in a sense but

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,880
um i just kind of want to show a few

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,599
more

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,160
a little bit more information on there

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,079
so

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,599
here we have um we have uh sort of the

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,839
leap

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,839
use and um

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,400
you know a lot of people don't seem to

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,440
be touched i mean well

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,520
see it's interesting that

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,640
the number of people that touch it on a

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,400
regular basis

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,440
is is split kind of in half

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,320
and then when we go to

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,960
tumbleweed you'll see that there's a lot

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,079
more

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,079
people using it

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,920
and so with that you end up uh

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,440
in discussion where where should we put

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,760
the focus you know

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
um

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
it's you know do we look at

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
the the desktop environment do we look

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,040
at the server aspects

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,720
um these are all sort of

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,960
points that i think we should we should

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,200
try to well

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,520
write down or get get down so that we

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,800
we're all kind of in the same page

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,800
of what we're trying to do here

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,839
well in in in terms of flagships

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,520
uh the main talking point that i've

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,520
i've historically used when talking

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,720
about open souza

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,800
uh is that open susa tumbleweed is the

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
rolling release with a safety net

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,000
and that's quite special because

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,000
i don't know of any other rolling

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,320
release distribution where

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,760
if it blows up in your face in an update

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,440
or if you've done something wrong in

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,640
your configuration or whatever

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,040
that you have a way to recover

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,000
barring something stupid like a hardware

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,000
fault

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,040
uh we don't promote this aspect of open

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,800
souza

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,000
very much and

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,880
if i feel like if we did if we talked

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,720
about this aspect a little bit more

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,680
we could really make the point

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,720
that we could have something something

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,200
approaching

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,320
a stable trustable rolling release

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,040
platform

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,320
something that you know takes on all the

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,839
good parts of

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,280
what people consider to be good about

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,640
arch and other similar rolling releases

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,119
and removing the bad parts we have a

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,640
tested platform it gets validated we

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,680
don't release snapshots unless

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,960
it it has some basic level of working

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,520
nature we don't we have a way for people

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,240
to go

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,359
backwards and forwards like this is this

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,359
is something that

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
basically nobody else has and that makes

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,880
tumbleweed very special

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,280
on the flip side if we were to get more

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,720
commercial arrangements that make uh

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,960
[Music]

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,640
leap more omnipresent uh then

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,160
then then it becomes a more interesting

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,640
conversation of whether we should flip

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,280
the flagship from tumbleweed to leap

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,880
uh because the availability of leap

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,839
would be higher

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:44,000
um as things currently stand

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,079
my my my gut feeling says

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,920
that we probably want to remain

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,240
considering tumbleweed as our

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,680
flagship because it has more

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,200
differentiators than

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,119
than the other linux distributions on

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,160
the market and that

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,640
is i think rather important

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:07,839
for us to be somewhat successful in

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,839
growing our community

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,359
can you list some of those

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,920
differentiators that are in your mind

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,560
and actually anyone um you know that

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,000
would be

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,400
you know that could be an article in

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,240
itself on the differentiators

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,800
and even maybe gear or engage with some

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,400
other people in the media who might be

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,800
willing to talk about the

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,440
differentiators between

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,280
tumbleweed and the other rolling

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,599
releases

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,599
sure

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,760
may i just ask a quick question here and

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,280
i'm asking it purely out of my ignorance

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,040
because it's relevant to some

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,040
thoughts that are going through my mind

00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:04,000
does does butterfile system

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,720
run on a looks volume volume

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,160
it does but the configuration is a super

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,520
obtuse

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,400
um okay up until extremely recently

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,480
configuring such a thing through yast

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,839
has been kind of painful

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,440
um but it should be relatively easy now

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,760
as of lead 15-2 so okay

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,119
um again just jumping in with one of my

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,640
own experiences that that why i'm in

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:38,079
in in leap and not on tumbleweed

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,079
on my desktop is i did run tumbleweed

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,200
for a time

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,280
but because of the difficulties

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,359
i was running on ext4 and then

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,200
something did go wrong and i had no

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,800
rewind button

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,040
and it was so painful it was

00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,400
it was basically a complete reinstall

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,680
uh from scratch and um sort of

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,000
reverting back to the safety net

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,839
uh and off going to leap which is why

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,720
i'm back on leave so

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,800
this this may be some uh something that

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,920
that that we need to think about

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,560
making easier because increasingly

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:26,000
in this day and age people do want an

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:29,040
encrypted file system

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,240
yeah and there's also things going on

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,640
uh in butterfest upstream um

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,800
mostly driven by uh conversations i've

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,560
had with butterfest developers

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,160
um in the fedora workstation working

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,400
group of

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,920
having butterfest get native support for

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,480
encryption including

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,680
being able to do blind backups in blind

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,880
encrypted backups

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,359
using butterfs send and receive blind

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,599
meaning that you don't need the key

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,800
to you don't need to decrypt anything to

00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,319
transfer

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,760
the the the at rest data the address

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,800
data can be transferred

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,440
encrypted um

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,839
that is something that once that lands

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,839
in the next

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,079
four to six months um will be very

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,280
interesting for us to start looking at

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,920
pulling in and and and

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,280
building solutions around it to make

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,280
that case a lot easier

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:30,000
but yeah if you want to have most the

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,040
benefits of tumbleweed

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,720
without any of the pitfalls

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,000
you kind of need to be using butterfest

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,720
yeah okay

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,200
i i hear you but i think what you're

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,200
saying is

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,880
down the line once butter fs can can

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:55,359
can do native encryption um

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,240
then are we in a position whereby we can

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,680
really put

00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,200
tumbleweed right at the forefront and

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:07,040
um sort of almost make tumbleweed

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,599
our desktop solution and

00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,599
leap as the server solution

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,240
we would need some desktop engineering

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,359
to be able to integrate

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,440
the new feature because right now

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,960
everything only knows lux

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,599
but yeah possibly andreas you know

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,640
you raise your hand yeah not directly

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,800
related to lux

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,200
but in general if we really want to have

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,240
people using tumbleweed on the desktop i

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,640
can share that

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,880
i've been adopting tumbleweed for half a

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,400
year now previously using leap

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,560
and one of the things that i think we

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,359
may need better solutions for

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,119
is that you know tumbleweed brings way

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,440
more frequent and

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,319
sometimes relevant updates to this

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,800
system

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
but when i really use my system as a

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,280
desktop then i have

00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,079
tons of console windows open i have

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,720
dozens of you know browser tabs open i

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,200
have like

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,800
five email drafts open at its time and

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,119
that is kind of

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,640
counterproductive for actually you know

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
rebooting the system

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,280
because at most i can restore the you

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,560
know firefox tabs back to what they were

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,800
previously

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,119
so that would be an idea that we may

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,800
want to think about how to improve

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,720
um if we really want to promote

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,079
tumbleweed as the main desktop for more

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,880
people

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,160
well there are i'm not going to go too

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,560
deep into this but there are two

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,920
technical strategies to solve this

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,880
the first technical strategy option is

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,000
to basically start forcing offline

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,480
updates

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,040
and and scheduling them rather than

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,760
having to

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
tell people to use you know zippered up

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,359
and then have

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,040
right away on the console like make sure

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,319
that they use the right path

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,240
through the graphical interface um the

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:57,119
second strategy is

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,119
we change basically everything so that

00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,720
updates and stuff don't apply to the

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,880
running system

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,640
and if you continually do updates or

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,480
installs or whatever

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,880
you have to reboot for them to take

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,839
effect which is the transactional update

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,839
transactional update model

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,359
i don't know which strategy we want to

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,680
go for the first one is actually

00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,680
probably easier to do

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,800
from a from a user experience

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,480
perspective

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,480
but the second one is something that

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,400
there is a subset of the opensuse

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,000
community who's quite interested in

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,400
i believe that's going on with the micro

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,960
s desktop work but

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,640
there there are ways to paths but

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,920
neither of them is a solution to what i

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,480
was raising

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,319
yeah there is in the end at some point

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,920
you will need to do a reboot in order to

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,599
have the new kernel

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,960
rather there is no solution for what

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,480
you're asking for

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,240
there are only paths in which we can

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,319
make that less painful

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,800
we cannot make updates work live

00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,800
full stop

00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,599
i suppose they're completely different

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,960
use cases

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:06,160
um in i

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,559
for example for most people they're

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,839
likely to do a complete shutdown

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,160
once a day or so um so that wouldn't be

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,200
a

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,040
a problem that you do your reboot at the

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,160
end of the day

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,119
um but if you have people that

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,599
have their desktop going all the time

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,720
then

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,559
that's a completely different use case

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,119
so perhaps that's just something we need

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,359
to make people aware of

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:36,960
yeah uh the two-pronged approach

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,119
basically is we got to figure out you

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,559
know how do we how do we communicate

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,839
this to users because

00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,119
you know when we made this change in

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,960
fedora um five years ago

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,800
where we changed all of our graphical

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,240
tooling to prefer offline updates

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,400
there was a subset of people who

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,760
screamed but it also

00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,640
changed it that change made open

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,400
made fedora look a lot more stable

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,240
because we didn't wind up in

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,079
inconsistent states all the time

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,599
and people gained that expectation of if

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,359
we're doing an update

00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,200
make sure we've got our work saved and

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,559
planned for it and that sort of thing

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,119
and there's things like scheduled

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,960
updates and that sort of thing

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,559
in the same vein that like windows and

00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,000
mac os both do

00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,599
and that's i think that's a more solid

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,040
approach for the vast majority of

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,400
desktop users

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,559
than trying to you know you know

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,240
climb up that mountain push a rock up a

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
mountain to

00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,760
uh to make live updates work without

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,760
breaking the desktop

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,119
yeah i agree i think if you look at most

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,160
operating systems around they

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,800
pretty much behave this way where

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,000
whenever you make a major uh update to

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,040
the system

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,280
you're expected to eventually start it

00:49:53,040 --> 00:50:01,520
or have it have it happening offline so

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,359
um i think uh for what i understood we

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,160
already do offline updates

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,599
uh at least for economically and ke as

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,319
far as i know

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,359
and uh for tumbleweed i think that's

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,720
probably the way

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:16,240
the way forward for all for for for all

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,839
desktop environments at least for

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,520
desktop users and

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,400
they will probably have to adapt to that

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,240
that new way of updating

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,680
offline updates are currently disabled

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,280
in gnome software and discover

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,119
because the zipper back end is broken

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,480
for this okay

00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,839
i was not aware it used to work not long

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,760
ago okay

00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,520
uh it kind of works in leap but then

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,760
susa for some reason made the decision

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,440
to turn off the feature and package kit

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,839
so it's just straight up disabled

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,839
everywhere

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,119
okay regardless i think we should

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,720
probably get that

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
working because i agree that offline

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,119
updates are probably the safer way to

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,920
update the system anyway

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,480
does does anybody know what percentage

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,599
of

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,480
of the distributions actually use gnome

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:07,599
or have any idea

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,359
uh i don't have

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:14,000
firm statistics but we do have

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,760
we do have statistics too we i don't

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,319
have firm statistics on a global basis

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,720
we have statistics for within open souza

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,599
i'm talking about open souza oh okay

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,480
well then

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,720
nope i think it's like uh i don't know

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,839
what

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,400
the exact numbers are yeah

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,160
things like 60 kde and then the rest is

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,079
split

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,520
okay well i must admit i'm i'm a kde and

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,640
one of the big reasons for coming to

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,520
open source was

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,839
was kde um

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,359
so that that's interesting it's what

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,800
we're known for we

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:53,760
well should we should we

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,319
really be looking at gnome as a serious

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,440
option

00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,920
or as an also ran type of desktop if you

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,960
really need it

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,559
we don't really have a choice we don't

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,720
really have a choice about not

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,559
supporting gnome as a flagship

00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,800
because sousa made their bed and they

00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,839
lie in it now uh really it's novell's

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,319
fault but like

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,200
they've been doing gnome for their

00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,960
desktop

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:21,680
for almost 10 years now so

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,359
we don't really have a choice in that

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,559
matter

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,400
we kind of need to make sure it's

00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,000
supported as a flagship because

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,559
otherwise we have a huge

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,800
discontinuity between susa linux and

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,640
opensuse linux

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,920
exactly that's exactly the point i think

00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,800
norm is the in terms of

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,440
enterprise is the desktop environment of

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,640
choice

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,119
for most distributions so not having

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,559
all of the open source yeah exactly yeah

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,599
everything in support

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,760
would probably not play well with what

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,319
we're trying to achieve to bring uh

00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,000
suzer linux and the open source

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,200
distributions

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,480
um i could

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,920
could we maybe move on um yes

00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,680
please can we move on okay great

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:12,400
i didn't want this to last so long um

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,359
so the next the next thing that i wanted

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,720
to

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,720
kind of go into was the

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,800
was sort of the global use and

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,000
demographics

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,559
and um i have a few

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,319
slides to bring out some information

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,319
that you might find interesting

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,000
dealing with the results but also like

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,440
what we've uh

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:42,390
yeah let me refresh it and

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:45,480
it worked the last time okay

00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,480
[Music]

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,800
okay

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,559
so the breakdown here

00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,800
um you can see

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,079
this is this is again this is just

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,680
purely results

00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,720
so you know

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,920
while a survey is good it

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,800
it only is as good as like the

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,480
people that participate right um but it

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,240
should it should give us

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,240
some good ideas um

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,200
and overall we see that primarily

00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,400
were a lot of the um people that are

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,400
using it

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,079
or sorry the people that responded

00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:39,760
are are primarily from europe uh age

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,100
was also an interesting um thing

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,179
um

00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,179
[Music]

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,079
i mentioned in the articles kind of like

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,839
focusing on

00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:55,280
um trying to increase

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:58,880
knowledge between in ages

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,880
below 35

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,720
just because it's you know the growing

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,720
well we we need to replace

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,079
to to be sustainable we need to look at

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,599
uh replacing

00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,599
um the people that

00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,119
are going to fill the gap so to speak

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,640
when when we get older

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:28,079
um or some of us who are already old

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,839
um so

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,280
i wanted to point that out i i don't

00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,960
know how we do it uh

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,960
you know it goes down to marketing but

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,960
also goes down to

00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,760
some social media and other things like

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,799
being in spots where perhaps

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,520
we're just uh not seeing i don't

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:48,160
know if tick tock's a great example of

00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,440
that but you know people are starting to

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,839
look at that um

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,200
there's also a new app called uh

00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,760
crowdhouse that i

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,440
uh sorry clubhouse that's out there and

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,640
i've um

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,559
brought some emails about uh perhaps

00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,240
emails about getting some people to have

00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,520
discussions on there if they

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:13,599
are interested um with that

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,599
about candy crush there yeah

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,760
it's it's an it's a really interesting

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,799
app it's people

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,559
they just discuss things and um

00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:27,839
i i could see it as a potential um

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:31,440
a potential opportunity for us

00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:33,359
in in the i mean not just open souza but

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,599
like in the in the linux

00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,280
open source world because i they they're

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:43,920
already having conversations about

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:45,040
uh open source it's just uh they term

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,799
when they're discussing it they're

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,799
discussing it like uh

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:52,880
uh as an entrepreneur type of aspect so

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,799
but interesting if you're if you want to

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,200
hear more about it

00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,960
just email me or something we can we can

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,599
discuss it

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,240
um so yeah the gender breakdown um

00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,040
we had this significant amount of people

00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,839
that did not

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:14,640
um did not

00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:19,839
respond um the non-binary was

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,839
a little bit higher than the um linux um

00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,480
survey that they did and then the female

00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:28,319
category was a little bit under

00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,280
um what linux

00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,359
linux foundation survey was actually if

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,240
you have such comparative data it would

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,400
be interesting

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,400
to put that in the slides in some form

00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,799
yeah see if i can

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,400
like you know for the geographic or you

00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,000
know what other you know well

00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,079
the g see and that's what i'm going to

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,920
get into i didn't i don't have um

00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:55,359
i mean that the the the um

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:59,359
linux one is um

00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:02,319
uh the linux um survey is online but uh

00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,160
yeah i could i could do that next time

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,000
but the other aspect of course is you

00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,240
know if we repeat this survey it would

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,079
be good to actually track you know like

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,799
how did it change from the last survey

00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:15,839
to the current one

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:18,160
plus minus things yeah

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,160
that's a good comment there and i would

00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,319
really like to add

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,920
not just the geographical region but

00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:29,520
maybe the selection by country

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,839
as well um so i'll just let you know

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,200
that

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:36,799
there's a with lime survey there is a

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,839
bug that has not worked out

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:43,520
so i've tried to do it um

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:45,599
i we our original intent was to do that

00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,119
unfortunately it didn't really uh work

00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,599
out because

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,040
it wouldn't accept it okay from

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:54,240
programming

00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,839
but um let me

00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,839
andreas's point of um

00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,400
having comparatives your year-over-year

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,319
comparative so that probably what you're

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,319
getting at andres

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,440
yeah just basically um you know

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,000
identifying trends and differences to

00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,040
you know

00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,880
right now it's just absolute numbers and

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,799
you know

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,000
we don't know you know does fedora you

00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,839
know maybe have the same

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,920
male dominated number are we better or

00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:28,960
less than fubar

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,960
and so on so yeah um

00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:36,400
so i did extract a little bit of that

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:39,280
um with some images here that i did

00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,280
um right before

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,119
right before we had the meeting and i

00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,720
put these in there

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,400
so you can see this is a month

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,559
this is strictly a month and actually

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,319
it's only really two weeks because

00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,440
um uh the the

00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:00,480
what used to be called piwik which is uh

00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,920
matsumoto uh was was down

01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,799
due to a power outage and we had that

01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,280
back up and so um

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,160
it didn't have the data from before and

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,480
so we're

01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,599
basically looking at two weeks but this

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,280
is software.opensuse.org so we know like

01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:20,079
it what's interesting every every nation

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,720
with the exception of south sudan is on

01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,799
there

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:29,359
um oh

01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:32,000
and it's rare is not there either

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,720
the one right above i think that's

01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,079
ethiopia

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:40,720
right on the side of the cube um

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,720
but overall you can see by the color

01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:47,520
what the um

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,040
with the actual use because if people

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:52,480
are on software right they're pro

01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,839
more than likely they're using it um

01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,799
so with that the overall look

01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:59,359
primarily the numbers as i as i went

01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,640
down

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:06,240
um were germany

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:09,359
was was first uh followed by the us

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:14,000
followed by brazil russia china

01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:14,000
india and

01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,160
then you can kind of go into

01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,640
each of the countries themselves and see

01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,799
what else is

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,559
is higher but that so that's just people

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,760
that in the past month we know

01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,319
have used it what is so is that

01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,400
i'm sorry is that just you know viewing

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,079
the web page or actually downloading

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,760
things from there

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,760
that is downloading some package

01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,880
whether whether it be um

01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,240
[Music]

01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,799
whether it be the actual um installation

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:56,000
media

01:01:50,799 --> 01:02:00,480
or um you know chromium

01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:04,119
it's it covers that um

01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,570
and then that's just

01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,960
opensuse.org

01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:10,480
[Music]

01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:13,920
so again overall uh

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:18,160
it's it's very nice to see that

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,799
when i get into the the wiki

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,079
you end up with a slightly different um

01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,039
well actually not not that much

01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:26,559
different

01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:28,000
um but the numbers were i believe it

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,520
looked like they were less

01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,359
and they should actually because if you

01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,640
look at the other maps they were

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:37,760
uh the colors were a bit more strong

01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:41,200
and then forms

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,119
very similar look

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,119
well actually the interesting thing here

01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,200
is that germany and the u.s appear to be

01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:51,599
inverted now

01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:54,400
yeah that's true huh yeah good point

01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:55,680
and china looks actually that was right

01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,599
when i looked at that

01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,359
china also was an interesting thing

01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:02,240
because

01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:03,039
they were i think they were a third on

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,039
that

01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,960
and it was a pretty high number it was

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:10,480
like seven thousand

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,680
seven eight thousand uh

01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,680
so it kind of stood out there

01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,440
which i think is an interesting social

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,200
data point

01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,520
that people communicate differently

01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,200
or within different well not differently

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,039
with different tools

01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:34,240
depending on like region

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,520
yeah it would be interesting to i know

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,200
we can't really do it

01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,400
the emailing it would be interesting to

01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,079
see where how the email looks

01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,000
because it's occasionally come up that

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,839
you know people from the forums are

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,680
actually you know reaching out either on

01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,440
rsc channel or um on on mailing list and

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,440
saying hey there's someone here that has

01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,880
a question that hasn't been answered

01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,039
is because you know like some of the

01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,880
really geeky experts are rather on the

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,000
mailing list and not on the forums

01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,000
answering those questions

01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:12,240
so um

01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,440
oops there does become a limit as to how

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,480
many streams

01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,559
anybody can follow uh you know with the

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,920
mailing lists or the forums uh

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,200
um it's

01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,359
it's one of the things i think we

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,760
touched on last week which is

01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:29,599
if we can narrow down these channels so

01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:34,240
that somehow

01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:41,839
um it it becomes easier to

01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:41,839
to find get answers to things

01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,480
and you can uh at the moment i think

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,599
we've got

01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:52,240
groups in discord telegram

01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:54,000
and uh the mailing lists and it goes on

01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,720
and on and on there's only

01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,680
that many hours in the day that anybody

01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,680
could follow all of this

01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,000
um these are again you know i listed

01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,960
questions just to

01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,760
sort of uh spark some conversation to

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,559
see

01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,920
like or dialogues to see like how we can

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:21,359
extract some of these

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,000
these things and and what with those

01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,200
graphics that i was showing um you know

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,240
that

01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,559
how do we how do we

01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,200
increase usage in other parts of the

01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,440
globe i mean

01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,760
uh south america is actually quite big

01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,599
for us seeing that

01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,160
brazil i know a lot of traffic comes out

01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,160
of brazil

01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,000
and asia has a significant amount as

01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,039
well and that is a

01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,640
growing market and will continue to be

01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,960
so

01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,960
um

01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:01,119
but you know there's also the aspect of

01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,880
how do we increase

01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:07,760
increase more uh people

01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,760
into the project and and by doing you

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,799
know more of the people like

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:16,240
like women uh people that identify as

01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:18,640
non-binary um how do we

01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,280
increase those and and if and if more

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,880
people come

01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,760
in to the project uh how likely is that

01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,359
to increase

01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:29,520
more visibility and

01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,839
yeah more visibility with them to kind

01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,520
of like

01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:37,280
um increase our numbers

01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:40,559
so that we're not complete dominantly

01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,559
male as this

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:48,559
is is the case with

01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,559
most or software

01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:03,039
statistics

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,960
i fear as with some other statistics

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,119
that we've talked about

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,319
those absolute numbers don't really

01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:12,319
explain

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:15,119
the why yeah so we basically just get a

01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:18,160
snapshot of what we do have

01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,760
but we don't really count the people

01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,720
that have you know like

01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,400
tried open zoos and have left because

01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,799
you know they didn't feel welcome or

01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,920
something here

01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:34,240
and we also don't really um you know

01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,839
catch the reason why they're here

01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,520
didn't they you know the ones that are

01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,280
not using open zoos or did they simply

01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,680
never hear about opensuse

01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,520
or did they see some reason in opensuse

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,599
that made them you know decide against

01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,599
it

01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,599
and also i think this is also partly

01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,280
coming back to the very beginning where

01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,440
we were talking about

01:07:53,280 --> 01:08:01,680
um the the visibility

01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:03,680
uh aspect has hurt us in this regard

01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,280
the lack of visibility has made it so

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,280
that we are

01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,720
while we do operate like like most

01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,720
community projects off of

01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:13,520
mainly word of mouth for spreading it

01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,799
the lack of word of mouth

01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:20,560
has allowed us to kind of stagnate

01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:24,159
in terms of diversity of people coming

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:26,799
into the project as a whole um

01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,799
i i don't know if there's really a

01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:33,040
straightforward way to fix this but

01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,839
like maybe a reorganization of how we do

01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,560
advocacy

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:37,199
and in as we mentioned at the top of the

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,600
hour

01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:41,759
you know block at the last hour the blog

01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,640
posts and stuff like that to help

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,040
you know increase the overall mind share

01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,880
um

01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,880
may actually naturally lead us to start

01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,560
seeing some of these other numbers start

01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,440
boosting a little

01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,159
um but there's also something i you know

01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,229
we've been

01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,400
talking about the survey a lot that um

01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:03,440
[Music]

01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,719
that i i wish i had mentioned earlier uh

01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,000
was that

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,400
the actual issuance of the survey did

01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,839
not

01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,120
get as much visibility as the results of

01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:16,560
it did

01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,799
so um for example i didn't even know

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,159
about the survey until it was over

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:24,400
um that's that's kind of

01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:28,159
and so that was a that was a problem

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,880
that meant that means that we have

01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,560
we we lacked some mechanism to make sure

01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,679
that all aspects of the opensuse

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,960
community

01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,319
we're aware that we are trying to

01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,319
solicit community feedback

01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,279
so one thing that i've been thinking

01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:49,359
about around

01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,520
about already last week is can't we just

01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,480
you know think about some mechanism to

01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,040
actually make

01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,320
or announce such a survey from within

01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,760
the os

01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,920
like you know having some form of

01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,480
desktop notification pop-up

01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,920
that says hey we're running a survey do

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,360
you want to participate and you know

01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,480
people can just click it away if they're

01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,239
not interested

01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,480
but that at least would make people more

01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:13,440
aware than just you know the odd

01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,560
social media post that one might miss in

01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,360
you know midst of

01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,480
you know all the political fighting and

01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,480
cat videos and whatnot

01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,239
if you had some sort of option to enable

01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,199
like open season news in your

01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,080
notifications

01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,600
i mean i don't know how that would work

01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,280
in gnome but like in you know in plasma

01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,520
it seems like that'd be

01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,280
somebody's like an rss feed like a

01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,400
default rss feed applet or something

01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,920
that kind of gives

01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,679
here's what's new in opensuse or

01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,800
something like that no

01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,000
that's a good idea i i assume opensuse

01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,280
news actually does have

01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
a feed uh that can be subscribed to so

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,560
like

01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,080
making a tiny relatively generic

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,880
application that can

01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:56,000
push notifications in each in plasma and

01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,920
gnome

01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,199
would probably help here

01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,480
uh there is yes there is

01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:09,120
the open source news open source uh

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,239
welcome the application we pre-install

01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:14,640
on pretty much every

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:18,560
system already has the first headline

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:21,760
from rss feed included as

01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,600
as a clickable link

01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,040
i think that the trick is because you

01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,159
close you know i don't leave the welcome

01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,760
open after i boot in

01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,960
but if you have like a little an applet

01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,239
or something that just kind of hides the

01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,239
notifications

01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,840
you know that the user could easily turn

01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,199
off that it would just say like

01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,280
the latest news just kind of pop up

01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,880
there in a notification you know next to

01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,719
you know i guess just got a telegram

01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,400
from neil you know stuff like that

01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,679
i think that would be a really great way

01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,199
to i mean i don't know how that would i

01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,000
know the best way to implement that

01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:48,800
but that does seem like a a reasonable

01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,480
way to keep

01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,080
keep the community like you know going

01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,640
back to one of the first statements that

01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,960
was made

01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,920
about you know making every helping

01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,239
helping to keep the

01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,960
regular user involved in the open source

01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,000
world

01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,960
you know with the option to turn it off

01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,800
too for those people who are a little

01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,880
bit you know you have to be very very

01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,360
careful how you deal with something like

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,199
that

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:12,800
um because i think it's fantastic idea

01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:17,199
but you need to make it really uh

01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:20,000
very public that uh it's an opt-in thing

01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:21,920
because i suspect a lot of people are

01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,640
switching to linux because they just

01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,239
don't like

01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:29,440
the uh inherent spyware and windows and

01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:32,400
mac and stuff like that so i i

01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,840
i i it would have to be it would have to

01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,760
be opt out

01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,480
because otherwise it wouldn't be

01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,480
representative

01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,440
you could definitely welcome screen a

01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,000
very simple thing on the welcome screen

01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,520
screen that basically says you know auto

01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
maybe you just have a check mark already

01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,120
there but

01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,960
it's not it would not be anything

01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,560
spyware it would not be there'll be no

01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,280
metrics pulled from it all it would be

01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,320
is do you want the rss feed on and your

01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,239
notification do you want you wouldn't

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,800
say rss feed but would you like a

01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,400
news feed of opensuse of what's going on

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,600
in opensuse in your

01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:11,520
in your um notifications very simple

01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:14,159
very plain nothing nothing creepy

01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,560
it'll be very simple can i just do that

01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,040
in

01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,600
thunderbird or like camel or whatever

01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,320
other

01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,440
rss clients you can do that already that

01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,960
and i think that's already really

01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,880
configured in all of them

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,640
but can we do it ourselves as open

01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,600
source basically in the package

01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,400
sort of include that by default that

01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,360
when you open

01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,080
thunderbird or k-mail or so at least

01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,000
with

01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,199
so at least with thunderbird and k-mail

01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,760
i thought we already

01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:41,760
were doing this um because we have a

01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,640
branding package that does pre-configure

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,800
stuff

01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,400
for those if it's not the case that

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,040
should be fixed but

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,960
the problem is intrusive than having

01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,880
like a pop-up that's what i mean

01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,280
well the problem is that if we don't

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,480
have something that say shows up in

01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:02,000
you know notifications and

01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:04,719
or or in the or the plasma you know

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,400
widget thingy in the bottom i i don't

01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,120
know how anyone's going to see it like i

01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,280
know in my

01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,640
experience i would never see anything in

01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,000
thunderbird or kml because i don't

01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:13,840
launch either of them

01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,760
unless i'm going to make a gpg signed

01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,880
email which i hope to

01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:21,440
don't do very often why don't we just go

01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:25,600
for a web push notification from the

01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:27,760
news ooh or some other webpage

01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,360
every every modern every modern browser

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,239
supports uh

01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,480
in in some way form a web push

01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,320
notification right

01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:38,080
yeah but you have to be on the site or

01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,760
load it up or something in order for the

01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,360
push to work

01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,120
you have to start your browser that is

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,520
all because it's a service worker

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,880
that works in parallel so there's no

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,320
more uh

01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,000
conditions that needs to be met okay

01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,159
maybe if everybody's always using their

01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,960
browser which is generally true

01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:57,280
that is an option it seems to be like

01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,360
the

01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:04,320
the lowest cost option here yeah well i

01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,760
all right i mean we can the other thing

01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,880
is that for server-side people we

01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,960
probably want some kind of mo

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:14,239
td thing but you know who knows

01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:17,280
i mean so just as a side note

01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:20,320
um if your

01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,560
your default browser at least would go

01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,600
to search.opensouza.org and there is

01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:29,280
news there

01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,880
already that goes to that so if i can

01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,800
interject another id

01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,920
so so one one thing is this web push

01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,199
thing another thing

01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,120
is um the news

01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,040
and all the media channels we have quite

01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,679
fragmented we could just say

01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,239
something like uh we could we could just

01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,040
make one

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,760
like the official thing for those that

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,080
may doubt

01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,760
that news is not the official thing i

01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,400
think it's quite clear but some people

01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,560
might not

01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,320
be aware of it and also we could provide

01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,120
a filter because i suspect that some

01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,080
people

01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,040
opt out from news in one way or another

01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,280
because

01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,719
there's no filter you have one feed and

01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,600
everything is lumped together

01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,960
we could just have a different field is

01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:13,520
there a different uh

01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,520
feed just for the very important stuff

01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,080
so yeah

01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:24,159
could we do it um

01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:27,840
sassy could we do like a um

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:30,080
category that we could attach to

01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,080
um

01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,800
see the artist yeah we've got yeah we

01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:39,040
could

01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:42,800
uh quite easily do uh per category

01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:45,120
feeds that's that's possible

01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,480
it would be just a matter of actually

01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:51,440
having attacked it

01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,440
that works with those very important

01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,840
notifications

01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,080
so yeah so if you have web push for

01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,199
category feeds

01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,600
and like underline when possible that

01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:19,840
this is the official channel for getting

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,840
news

01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,040
it would be quite good

01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:32,159
okay so we did have an

01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,040
announcement on the opensuse announce

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,320
list

01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,199
um but that was well december 20th which

01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,199
is you know like

01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,480
basically when people start going into

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,120
their uh

01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,400
vacation and holiday season so if we

01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,159
could i don't know announced that a

01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,159
couple weeks earlier that there will be

01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:50,320
a survey and then in a second step that

01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:53,520
announced the survey is now open

01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:56,880
um that may also be more um

01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,640
inviting to people so let's actually

01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,400
watch out for those notifications

01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,760
yeah i think for the survey as far as

01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,280
the survey is concerned

01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,760
uh i do not know what we forgot to do

01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,000
i think everything was was done perhaps

01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:14,000
the timing was not ideal but

01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,040
i think all platforms were covered

01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,400
we didn't we didn't message and just

01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,960
we had what's happening yeah we speaking

01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,400
together

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,480
uh neil what did you say sorry we didn't

01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:29,840
have effective messaging of the survey

01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:32,880
in discord telegram um or matrix

01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,360
or irc for that matter oh yeah you're

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,320
right

01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,760
yeah and so and that's where i primarily

01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,760
interface with

01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,280
the open source community because i help

01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,920
a lot of people

01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,800
on board in the open source of discord

01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,520
and so

01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,880
i didn't see the survey until it was

01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:52,560
mentioned to me

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,719
very late until after it had closed

01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,560
yeah that's possible because it was

01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:00,640
mentioned on discord but i think

01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,800
uh maybe uh if it was not repeated or

01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,159
i i vaguely remember that there was a

01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,159
mention about the survey

01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:12,400
yeah because discord actually um uh

01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:15,760
keeps track of the news oh oh new posts

01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,880
and as part of that it was mentioned but

01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:21,600
i i don't subscribe to any of those yes

01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,080
yes so you're not uh i mean i i fully

01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,760
understand

01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,840
that it was not visible enough in that

01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,760
regard

01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,960
i don't know yeah so if you have a

01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,159
better idea i'm

01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:36,800
totally open-minded about how could

01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:40,000
could could we maybe just an idea um

01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,800
so andreas had mentioned like the time

01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,080
frame and i

01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,600
i understand it was the first time we

01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:49,040
were doing it um but

01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,480
what about an ideal time to actually do

01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,920
the survey i mean it's an end of the

01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,440
year survey does it actually have to

01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,679
happen within that year

01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,920
i mean we don't have any you know it's

01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:01,440
not like elections for the board right

01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,920
so so

01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,560
is there a more ideal time that we could

01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,199
look at

01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,199
to actually do the survey um i think the

01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:12,320
end of the year is not a good time

01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:13,199
to be honest because at least probably

01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,960
not just me

01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,880
but people have other things in their in

01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,679
their mind

01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,719
they i normally um i'm a little bit more

01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:24,000
like attentive

01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,840
of what's happening in in in open source

01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,040
award but like end of the year between

01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,040
christmas and

01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,520
and different activities i tend to have

01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,440
other things so

01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,560
maybe instead of doing it at the end of

01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,080
the year let's

01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,480
do it like in the middle of summer or

01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,960
some some other time that it's

01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,679
well when people aren't that's not ideal

01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,679
either yeah

01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,199
would have another idea so um why don't

01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,800
we

01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:52,800
um you know do it i don't know like a

01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,679
month or something before opensuse

01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,360
conference

01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,960
because that would then also give us a

01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,159
venue to present

01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,560
and discuss the you know that the data

01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:06,000
that's been collected

01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,120
that's a good idea that probably makes

01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,080
sense although

01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,199
when is the open source conference i

01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,220
think that's

01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:16,560
or something yeah well

01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:18,320
[Music]

01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,280
that's why i asked the question because

01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,280
i don't know anymore

01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,040
was in october but usually i think

01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,600
usually it's around

01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,199
may or june no it's usually time to go

01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,480
with the leap release

01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:34,080
yeah well i know that

01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,520
last year was an exception because it

01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,560
was postponed uh

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,239
to do the virtual one but i think it was

01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,000
already going to be in september last

01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,760
year because of

01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,480
libreoffice they were the ones running

01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,800
okay okay okay

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,120
yeah and that's the thought that we were

01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,400
going to do it with them again

01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:57,440
um okay so we're doing a fall thing

01:21:54,400 --> 01:22:00,800
well that's that typically right

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:03,520
it was in it was may june time frame

01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,880
um with recent releases because the

01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,530
reasons before used to

01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,199
happen in october-ish but um

01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:12,159
[Music]

01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:14,000
the i mean right now no one's really

01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,440
going forward with any plan because no

01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,520
one really knows

01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,840
can we get a physical one and everyone's

01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,000
kind of holding off linux northwest

01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,280
a lot of them are just kind of like not

01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,760
really sure

01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,560
um so i don't know right now and

01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:31,840
actually i'd like to

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,840
probably kick that off as an idea

01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,679
so here's here's another potential

01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,159
option

01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,000
we could have a release party a virtual

01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:42,639
release party thing where we announced

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,400
the survey as part of it

01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:45,760
and have people give feedback at that

01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,280
time

01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,120
so something that that i don't

01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:53,600
i've seen other communities do that we

01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,000
haven't done specifically is

01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,360
the idea of celebrating the release

01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,800
separately from celebrating the

01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,080
community

01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:04,960
uh so at the release time

01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:05,360
is also the height beast cycle for uh

01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,800
for

01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:12,480
opensuse so that would be the

01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:14,960
potentially strongest uh way to

01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:17,920
to plug the survey because people will

01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:20,560
see like hey we've we've put out leap153

01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,760
and with this we want to you know we

01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,679
want to learn from you

01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,760
how how we're doing and where we want to

01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,639
go and and that sort of thing

01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,679
um and if we put those relatively close

01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,320
to each other

01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,679
there's a maximal chance of people

01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,520
seeing it

01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,560
and that's independent of when we do the

01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,560
opensuse conference

01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:45,199
we did have some sort of uh

01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:48,719
q a asking you know how did

01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:52,080
how did how did the release go for you

01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:54,430
yeah um and i can't remember the

01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,840
the relative timing of that um

01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:59,199
[Music]

01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,239
whether it was close to or um when we

01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:04,320
did the

01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:07,760
the thing with uh libra libra office but

01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:09,679
um we certainly

01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,760
we certainly do get that feedback and i

01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:17,840
think that timing would be

01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,840
very important i i do like the idea

01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:36,639
oh the releases were in october so 15.

01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:40,000
sorry 13.2 came out in october

01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:43,040
um 42

01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,639
also came out 42.1 came out

01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:51,120
in october uh i think what flipped

01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:54,159
to the fall or sorry the the spring was

01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:57,280
um 15.0

01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:59,760
and so with that like we can't really be

01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,320
certain that it's gonna happen

01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:04,320
you know like clockwork so really i

01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,800
think picking a month

01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:08,639
uh and that also goes to the fact with

01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,719
the conference as well

01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:15,920
um picking a month might

01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,920
be more optimal

01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,320
well if we were going to pick a month

01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,199
and we're going to do an end of the year

01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,639
survey let's

01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,080
assuming we're going to keep calling at

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,520
the end of the year survey i would say

01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,560
that the latest month we would want to

01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,040
do it is november

01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:30,239
and then we would hold it open until the

01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,360
end of november

01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:36,800
and then and then it can be used to do

01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,800
this sort of thing in january

01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,880
well i i guess one i wouldn't be so much

01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,320
attached to

01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,239
to making this maximally regular

01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,560
i think my primary question is what do

01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:53,360
we want to accomplish

01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,719
um and so depending on that do we want

01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,120
to

01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,880
become you know do we want to use this

01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,880
as a starting point for conversation at

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,360
the next open suse conference do we want

01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:07,360
this is the starting point for a next

01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:10,719
planing cycle for leap or

01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:13,440
all of the above and and much more and

01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:15,040
i i i think we may be overthinking it

01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,239
just

01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,360
pick a good time run it the next time

01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:24,639
i think it was a success or it it it's

01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,280
it's proving that it was a good idea um

01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,040
so let's just run it another time not

01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,800
too soon not too late

01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:36,080
and and then see

01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,719
what what what makes sense what we learn

01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,719
etc

01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,199
yeah i absolutely agree with what you

01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:49,280
just did gerald i think

01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:52,320
it it loses some interest if it becomes

01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:53,679
too regular to trivial because we want

01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,920
to observe changes

01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,880
and changes need time so just for that

01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,000
reason

01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,480
it might be easier to to

01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,520
promote and to get traction if it's not

01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,080
too regular

01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:08,719
so something like every two years or

01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:10,800
every three years something like that

01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,320
i don't think that's what he was saying

01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,960
i think he was saying that

01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:18,000
it's less important that the regularity

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:21,199
be tied to a specific event

01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,960
or a specific context because

01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:26,719
if we if we don't have a way to

01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,679
to figure out how we can continuously

01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:32,719
improve i don't know how we will improve

01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,560
uh and we don't have we have even less

01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,080
feedback mechanisms than most other

01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,400
projects do

01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,480
because we've historically shied away

01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:43,120
from gathering feedback

01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,880
so the the fact that we're even doing

01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,040
this at all is fantastic

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,920
and i would like for us to keep doing it

01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,679
on the on a yearly cadence because

01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,360
i think that is the best cadence in

01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:57,760
which we can you know

01:27:53,360 --> 01:28:02,080
reflect and and realize and move forward

01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:03,679
but what is the timing specifically

01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,199
that that's the part we have to figure

01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,440
out but i i think

01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:08,239
gerald wasn't disagreeing that we

01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,199
shouldn't

01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:12,320
about the cadence in terms of how often

01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:15,440
it happens

01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:19,600
it's just more of when

01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:23,199
specifically do we do it

01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:29,600
is less important from his perspective

01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:32,320
okay then my bad if i um

01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,000
so i like the idea to do it completely

01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:37,120
um

01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,159
well i mean doing it during a month or a

01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,840
month long

01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:42,719
period we had it open for two weeks is

01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,920
that right yeah it's pretty much

01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:50,320
um the longer the better

01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,679
um and

01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,639
you know we could do it the entire month

01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:56,480
of november we could do it

01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:58,159
starting at november 15th and go to

01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,639
december 15th

01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:02,320
uh that would probably be also quite

01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,280
good because

01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:07,360
you well there's there's a lot of

01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,199
different news that can happen

01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:12,800
and yeah yeah that it probably makes

01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:15,840
sense to do it mid-november

01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:19,280
through to mid-december for

01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:24,080
for all kinds of good reasons

01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:27,160
including every four years

01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:30,320
um whatever could he be talking about

01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:33,199
[Laughter]

01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,600
i have no idea yeah definitely i'm

01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:38,560
totally confused

01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,560
paula what pop

01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,000
if it's open long enough i don't think

01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:49,199
it matters if you

01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,199
do it in december um

01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,239
i think the point that maurizio was

01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,120
making is that

01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:55,490
december tends to be a very busy month

01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,360
um

01:29:55,490 --> 01:30:00,800
[Music]

01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:03,440
ideally the end of year

01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,840
is a good time so that you can you can

01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:08,320
sort of collate the results and

01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:10,239
go into the new year with with with the

01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:13,679
benefit of the results

01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:14,639
um the issue was i think it was possibly

01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:18,840
only open

01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:22,400
for too short a time um so

01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:25,600
uh december to

01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:27,840
mid of january so in between

01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,679
christmas and new year mostly the people

01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,360
cool down a little bit and have time to

01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:34,400
take care about something like that

01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:35,840
and send out a reminder

01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,440
each week or every two weeks or

01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,840
something like that but

01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,639
this is just another another uh thought

01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,400
but also

01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,920
you know there are a lot of um you know

01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,000
community podcasts out there you know

01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,560
like destination linux network or

01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,840
or um jupiter broadcasting maybe even

01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,520
reach out to them do some kind of like a

01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,239
a press release packet directly to them

01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,639
as well

01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:56,159
saying hey could you hit this on uh on

01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,520
your community news section

01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:02,159
it might it wouldn't hurt but

01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,840
yes i think it's good and actually i

01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:07,120
think i'm on destination

01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:10,719
books a week from now oh wow really

01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:13,600
finally um but

01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:15,679
may propose that we change direction a

01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,679
little bit because we just had a survey

01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,760
we have the results

01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:21,040
so i think it's most meaningful for us

01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,320
to actually see what we do with the

01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:26,320
results

01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:29,520
um and i think that's what adrian

01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,840
tried to or tried to point out is

01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,639
it it's more meaningful to do another

01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:37,280
survey if you can show some

01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:40,000
some change that the previous had um

01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:43,120
otherwise you know

01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,520
we become experts at surveying and

01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,239
what we want to become is experts at

01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,960
changing

01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,960
based on on on input

01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,880
absolutely i think it's

01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,760
also very important that when we do the

01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,440
survey

01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,639
that we try and get the get news of the

01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,600
survey out to

01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:09,920
as large a community as possible not

01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,480
only the open source community

01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,120
because some of the feedback that we

01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:16,000
would get

01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,639
from other linux users or non-linux

01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,480
users

01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:22,880
would be potentially very very valuable

01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,880
to us

01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,719
i don't think it's limited to open

01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:40,320
source users but

01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:44,320
i think it's only marketed to open

01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,080
users i agree with you i'm asking did we

01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,719
actually have a path

01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:51,120
in the survey specifically like if

01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,760
someone says i don't use open souza

01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,440
to give them a set of questions to

01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,639
answer

01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,920
why they i don't think we did i i don't

01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:03,280
think we did

01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,159
um i'm just i'm just putting it out

01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,800
there that

01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,520
potentially when we do a survey we

01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,080
should

01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,360
hear from all sides not only our own

01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:14,320
guys

01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,320
sure absolutely

01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,440
because it's only by talking to other

01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:22,639
users

01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,719
um or other uh

01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,080
off of all operating systems not only

01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,480
linux ones

01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:30,800
uh that that we can understand their

01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:33,520
concerns and try and address them

01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,520
win them over

01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,360
uh i mean it's there was a purpose for

01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,880
the survey and the survey was was

01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,320
designed to fit that purpose

01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:47,360
which was to and identify

01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,239
and possibly correct issues from people

01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,080
that are used to to use our distro so

01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,120
you can repurpose the survey no problem

01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:57,040
with that but

01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:58,719
we are shifting the topic here i think

01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,400
well i don't i think that this would

01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,159
that was always part of what this

01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,639
this conversation was about to begin

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:07,120
with because

01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:08,719
the underlying problem that we have

01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:11,280
discovered is that we haven't

01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,320
we're not growing in the way we expected

01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,120
and that

01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,080
and growth requires outreach to new

01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,840
people

01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:22,639
so we can't really we can't as

01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,199
easily figure that out from ourselves as

01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,199
we could

01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:26,239
from talking to everyone who won't who

01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,560
hasn't

01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,480
who is out there who could potentially

01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,480
become part of the community

01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,400
so can you give an example of a type of

01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,040
question you would you would ask to the

01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,600
to the outsiders to to gather this

01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,600
information

01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,600
uh well if they answered uh to the

01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,920
question

01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,440
uh are you using opensuse if they

01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,080
answered i don't

01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,199
uh i've never heard of opensuse then you

01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:55,119
could ask

01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:57,600
uh uh questions about

01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:59,360
linux about computer things or whatever

01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,280
what they consider valuable and not

01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,679
valuable for those sorts of things

01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,199
or if you're asking if they ask if they

01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:07,920
answer to that question

01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:09,920
uh i know i use another linux

01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,679
distribution you can ask questions about

01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,440
what do you like what distribution do

01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:14,800
you use what do you like about it what

01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,119
don't you like

01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,880
again there's there's a there's paths

01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,960
that you can take here

01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,320
to try to get useful information about

01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:25,760
how

01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:28,800
other people perceive

01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,199
the linux platform opensuse that sort of

01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,960
thing

01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:34,159
and that we can use that to figure out

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,159
where we should move

01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,960
possibly but you have to to make a clear

01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,080
distinction between someone who

01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:46,000
knows what they want who've

01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,520
thoroughly tried and opened his

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,440
distribution and

01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:54,239
have meant blockers

01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,560
and have retreated from that on the one

01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,679
hand

01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:00,000
from the guy who just like uh

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,440
tried the the live image didn't work uh

01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,560
switch to something else

01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,679
and it's it's it adds a lot of um you

01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,320
have to add a lot of

01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:10,800
filters and fail safe so that you can

01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:14,320
distinguish between these cases

01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,239
and that's quite some work and

01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,920
even though i mean even if we managed to

01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:21,040
do that i'm not sure we can get

01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,239
a superb uh

01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:25,440
overview of the situation for for for

01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,440
outsiders

01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,600
i'm not so so point is i'm not saying

01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:32,719
it's not possible i'm just saying

01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:35,679
um it has to be useful

01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:37,520
and i'm not sure the cost efficient cost

01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,600
efficiency of this move would be

01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,920
easy to achieve the other point is uh

01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,639
what are the chances that a survey that

01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,520
doesn't target opensuse users

01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:51,040
will reach non people that are not using

01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,239
open sources right

01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:57,600
and even if it does all how

01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:59,600
representative would be the answers that

01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,239
these people give because uh

01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,760
i would expect that people answering our

01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:06,400
survey are people that actually

01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,480
are within our ecosystem or somehow

01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:11,600
connected to our channels

01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,600
in one way or the other

01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,080
and i expect that these people are most

01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,080
of them are at least using one of our

01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:22,719
distributions

01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,480
or do we want to go do we want to go

01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:28,320
down the path where this is just a

01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,560
different um this is just a different uh

01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,520
survey in itself and we could go and

01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,840
just

01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,840
target it as linux

01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,719
we have we have the tool um

01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,800
you know uh i i know that has not been

01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:47,920
integrated yet with the uh

01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,920
open souza sign on stuff but uh i

01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,159
believe that is the plan

01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,920
and that means that basically anyone in

01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:57,840
the community can can really

01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:00,880
um make make a survey

01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:04,000
but besides that um

01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:07,840
right like why not target

01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:10,320
and get a better understanding for the

01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,400
linux users or non linux users aren't

01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:15,040
you why aren't you using linux you know

01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:16,239
or uh why aren't you using opensuse why

01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:21,280
aren't you using

01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:21,280
um yeah

01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:25,040
deanna they can hear you

01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:32,159
the biggest question to ask is what what

01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,800
what do you want that would make it make

01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:36,880
you change

01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,239
what can an open source do for you to

01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,239
make you switch to it

01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,840
that's where you're really going to get

01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:45,840
to people's pain points

01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,080
you might open a pandora's box there but

01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,000
you know that

01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:55,040
that's that's a i've always found that a

01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,040
very powerful question

01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:59,600
and i think we have enough people here

01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:04,080
that are interested enough knowing

01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,080
those things um

01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:08,639
and we could make it up really a

01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:12,159
community effort

01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,560
across the across the ecosystem to kind

01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:16,080
of

01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:16,080
share those results with everyone

01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:27,840
if we wanted to do that

01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:33,119
i think we do it's just more of a

01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,719
question of

01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,320
how do we want to position those how do

01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,679
we want to market and how do we how do

01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,920
we make it

01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:45,600
visible um but i like a lot of what

01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:47,280
um nate was saying earlier about just

01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,639
making it like once we have such a

01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:51,840
survey make a press kit

01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:55,440
and and push it out there for for

01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:59,920
um influencers to to spread the word

01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,920
so that we can get some semi-useful data

01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,520
that would be a very good thing actually

01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:12,639
it was also a point that was uh

01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,280
raised in the the last session um

01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,679
the the only my only concern here is

01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,560
that

01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:20,239
we need to have a kind of a team of

01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,960
dedicated people

01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,920
uh that would do that because you need

01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,239
to

01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,360
build trust and build relationship with

01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:30,159
influencers

01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,480
and postcasters etc so that they invite

01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:33,600
you

01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,119
etc and feature you in their thing and

01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,719
which then brings the question how do

01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:40,000
you get these uh

01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:43,360
these these very dedicated people and

01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,159
you know better uh neil from the fedora

01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:47,360
probably

01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:47,920
uh but you guys have quite dedicated

01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,960
teams

01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,880
about that and i've my hunch and maybe

01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,480
tell me if i'm wrong but my hunch is

01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,239
that you managed to

01:40:54,480 --> 01:41:01,520
to pull these teams together because you

01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:03,600
made it you made the the federal

01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,639
community experience great in the sense

01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,280
that many people

01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,159
feel it's fun to be part of the fedora

01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,480
community

01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:12,000
you have video games evenings you have

01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,639
pizza parties

01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,040
all over the place and it i mean many

01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,719
people especially the young people they

01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,320
i can't imagine they don't they don't

01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:23,280
feel that

01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,159
very fun and and sympathetic and warm

01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,560
environment

01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:27,840
and i'm not sure we have the same here

01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,040
so if that is

01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:33,920
if the path to better promotion uh

01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,960
uh goes through having people that feel

01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,600
the fun

01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,119
of the community we might as well start

01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,480
here

01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:44,400
yeah no you're right and and i remember

01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,840
when fedora wasn't like that

01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:49,040
you know i i've been involved in the

01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,880
community for almost 15 years

01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,800
uh which i think is how long fedora's

01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:56,400
been around yeah

01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:59,199
almost 15 years yeah and it it

01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,480
only in the last six or seven years has

01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,159
that actually been a thing

01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,920
and it was a slow going process but it's

01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:06,800
paid off a lot

01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,840
and i think we do we're in a better

01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,400
place

01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,360
in open season now than fedora was seven

01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:15,840
years ago

01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,840
so we can think about at all

01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,800
i'm sorry what

01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:25,360
uh i i didn't hear if somebody said

01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:29,600
something but

01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:32,400
uh being able to um

01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,880
you know help people coordinate how have

01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,880
a place where they feel welcome to

01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,239
to be part of the community to help

01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:42,239
advocate

01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:44,159
to to have a way to organize and to do

01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,960
this

01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,360
is is helpful and will make i think will

01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,920
help

01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,920
make it better

01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:57,840
i'm sorry i think someone was saying

01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,840
something well

01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:04,639
i don't really hear everything oh it was

01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:07,119
doug

01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,840
looping my own conversation cool all

01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:11,760
right

01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:13,920
uh yeah so yeah there are lessons to be

01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,840
learned here about how fedora did it and

01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,000
how we can adapt some of those lessons

01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,040
what we have we're slightly better off

01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,119
than fedora

01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:26,719
is in the sense that um we have

01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:29,760
friendlier active communities in discord

01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:31,440
and in telegram that we can seed from we

01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,520
just need to

01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:35,679
start organizing that and turn that into

01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,880
something that is more focused

01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:41,119
and then support resources from

01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,719
susa from other members of the community

01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:46,000
to make things like

01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,119
you know at those pizza parties and

01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,199
things like that

01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:53,840
um help them become things that help

01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:53,840
show that opensuse is a fun place to be

01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,000
i mean there was recently an effort uh

01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:03,360
between maurizio

01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,040
and kurft and myself and a few others

01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:07,040
to have this open susa bar thing which

01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:11,390
[Laughter]

01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,840
could start we could start broadcasting

01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:25,119
it and and doing some things to like

01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,320
get people to show up and even get

01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:28,000
members from other communities like

01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
let's get some fedora people to show up

01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,119
in

01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,960
in the open souza bar actually i agree i

01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:35,040
hope you

01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,360
fedora has like social power which i

01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,719
actually participated like uh yesterday

01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:42,400
or two days ago

01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:44,800
and uh yeah i mean i i think uh

01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,480
the idea works it's a way for people to

01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:50,080
just like uh

01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:52,560
talk about anything and get to know

01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,679
the the the people who are involved in

01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,679
the projects

01:44:53,679 --> 01:45:00,880
and from my understanding uh the fedora

01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:03,280
social hour is open to anyone right

01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:06,080
right that's correct yeah so i had the

01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:08,560
same idea i think the opensuse bar

01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:17,840
uh should be the same like any bar you

01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:17,840
you just go in and meet people right

01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:27,600
or for example i suggest

01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:30,800
something similar uh podcasted

01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:36,560
an interview some important

01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:36,560
users inside opensuse to explain

01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:43,679
why you believe in opensuse what

01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:47,119
is your um

01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:50,560
the way to use opensuse and

01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:53,119
something else but not formally

01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:59,840
is something similar a little

01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:59,840
conversation with

01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,719
can can you hear me now yes

01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:22,480
okay

01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,280
well we have doug show up in the open

01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,080
souza bar and just start talking about

01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:33,360
why he loves

01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:33,360
you know being being an okra tusa person

01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,480
the first requirement is is that he

01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,920
needs to be drinking beer right

01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,239
right well that's easy he lives in

01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,239
germany

01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,199
i have one that's about 10 feet away

01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:51,280
from me

01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:51,280
excellent my name written all over it

01:46:52,639 --> 01:47:01,249
in my book that's 10 feet too far away

01:46:55,230 --> 01:47:01,249
[Laughter]

01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:05,520
quick question guys

01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:13,440
sorry quick question um this

01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:14,159
survey i'm i'm wondering about some of

01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,719
the

01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:22,719
other sort of open sousa

01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:26,239
national groups

01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:28,080
i'm thinking about opensuse indonesia

01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:31,520
they're very active they've got a lot of

01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,520
people and

01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,199
i i wonder

01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,040
how many of them were actually involved

01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:44,320
in this

01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:44,320
survey and to what extent

01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:51,199
we can bring those national groups

01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:52,800
more into the core because they have

01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:55,920
very very lively

01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,520
um uh groups

01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,239
in amongst themselves in their own

01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:03,600
language which is

01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:04,000
understandable but i'm i'm thinking

01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,440
about

01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:10,800
the the demographic of the people

01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:13,760
here on this um on this on this

01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:17,040
particular chat and the one last week

01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:20,719
um it's

01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:24,480
it's it's it's it's it's not very global

01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:27,840
let's put it that way um

01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:29,679
any very weighted for example

01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,360
i think a hundred percent of open source

01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:35,280
of hong kong are here

01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:39,600
that's maurizio and me well then

01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:42,719
well no there is from indonesia

01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,480
okay i mean i know that the language and

01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:47,760
it was mentioned in the comments here

01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:48,320
um that language is is sometimes it's a

01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,080
barrier

01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:53,040
you know because you know not everyone's

01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:53,040
comfortable um

01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:59,520
presenting or or or watching in english

01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,760
granted all of us have a different

01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:05,440
accent to our english and

01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:09,440
um uses different vocabulary for it so

01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:11,440
of course yeah

01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,760
so there is there is that aspect that is

01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:16,400
missing

01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:18,159
i i really think leveraging the the open

01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,360
source asia community would be

01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:22,639
would be great i mean they're uh i've

01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,840
been to their

01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:28,639
their uh summits they do and i mean

01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,760
they do a fantastic job and they're

01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:33,280
self-organized

01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,280
and you know

01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:38,560
i'd like to see something like that in

01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:41,119
north america south america

01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:42,080
africa that's where we could get a lot

01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:47,280
of movement as well

01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:50,480
but um nothing's nothing's really

01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:52,960
um changed there i i

01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,000
this is where i think that if we had

01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,040
like a

01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,199
a parent advocacy organization the same

01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:02,400
way that fedora has the mindshare group

01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:03,679
we could bring all those those local

01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,920
communities

01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:08,719
into the advocacy organization and they

01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:11,360
could actually start helping each other

01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:13,280
across the across the globe because

01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,599
that's one of the benefits we had

01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,199
from bringing all of the different local

01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,480
advocacy groups in fedora

01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:20,719
under the banner of the mindshare

01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,840
organization they started sharing with

01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:25,040
each other

01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:27,760
how they advocate for fedora

01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:28,400
and it has had a positive feedback uh

01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,199
loop

01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,400
for each of the teams and has had

01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:34,400
positive impact

01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:35,840
for fedora globally and that's something

01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,599
i think we actually

01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,960
have much stronger global teams than

01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,679
fedora does

01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,400
we could leverage that a lot better if

01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:47,440
we had

01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:47,440
that kind of a structure to support them

01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:53,599
just a context could you could you just

01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:56,719
describe roughly what you have in mind

01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:59,520
uh about that i mean what how do you how

01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:59,520
do we achieve that

01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,440
so um one of the

01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:07,040
as i said a lot earlier in this call one

01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,080
of the things i have trouble with is

01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:10,480
coming up with

01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,440
how i would advocate for open souza as a

01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,840
whole

01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:16,000
um obviously people who are strong

01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,719
enthusiastic user communities like the

01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,119
the lovely folks in opensuse indonesia

01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:22,080
they

01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:22,639
act they have really strong talking

01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,520
points

01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:25,840
and communication styles and things like

01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,440
that

01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,360
they already used to advocate for

01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:31,440
opensuse that

01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:33,840
we just don't have rep we don't have

01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:37,119
that information we don't know how

01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:38,320
they are able to be so strong and how we

01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:41,679
could use that

01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:45,280
to help say bolster the rest of asia

01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:48,159
to bolster the americas and africa

01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,880
in particular like these are the teams

01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:51,199
themselves

01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,280
are successful but they're isolated and

01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:55,440
bringing them into a larger fold

01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:57,520
where they can share with each other can

01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,719
make it possible for all the teams to be

01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,599
able to

01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:02,719
grow and support themselves all right i

01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:05,520
see

01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,080
thanks um here's something anecdotal

01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,599
neil

01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:12,960
um the

01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:16,239
whole conversation about getting those

01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:18,800
um those groups involved in

01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:20,719
in opensuse let's call it for one of a

01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:24,080
better word global

01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:27,599
very difficult um it also comes from

01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:31,360
the mindset um i

01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:34,800
uh was talking to someone in opensuse

01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:38,159
indonesia uh when when

01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:43,360
we were doing the elections and um

01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:45,679
i said to this guy um

01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,599
have you voted you should vote and he

01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:51,360
said well actually i'm not a member i'm

01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,360
i'm a member of open source id

01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:57,520
and i i was i was crestfallen

01:52:54,480 --> 01:53:00,080
i really was um

01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,880
there's such a strong community out

01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:04,159
there

01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:05,920
and we don't even know about them well

01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:08,320
that's the problem i'm talking about we

01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:11,119
used to have that problem in fedora too

01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:12,960
you know six-ish years ago um there you

01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,560
the russian fedora community was totally

01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,719
separate from the fedora one

01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,000
the main fedora global organization the

01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,599
one that ran for platinum

01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
the one that ran south america was

01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:24,000
completely separate the one for mexico

01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:28,239
completely separate the one for

01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:30,480
um egypt and uh and what was it um

01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:31,920
morocco they were completely separate

01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:35,199
and they were all

01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:37,520
essentially unaffiliated with fedora in

01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:39,280
such a way that they didn't feel that

01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:40,960
they could participate in the global

01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,560
project and they could help each other

01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:45,040
be successful

01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,800
pulling all of those organizations into

01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:49,760
the main open seas organization while

01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:51,119
giving them keeping their autonomy

01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,800
meant that they felt like they were

01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:55,520
involved and had ownership

01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:57,119
in opensuse project as a whole and felt

01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,080
like they could be part of the larger

01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:02,159
community

01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:04,719
that was a very big important factor

01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:06,960
that helped make fedora's mindshare

01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:08,400
group much more successful

01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,239
and i think this is something we need to

01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:12,560
do in opensuse because

01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:13,360
we have the same problem except it's

01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,440
worse

01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,800
because there's this two-tier system

01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:18,159
where there are community members that

01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,239
literally cannot vote

01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:22,159
because we have this distinction between

01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:25,679
a community person and a member

01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:28,000
based on some iffy whatever thing

01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:29,360
and that just makes people feel like

01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,239
they have less ownership

01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:34,239
and less of a stake in the project as a

01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:40,000
whole yeah i

01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:41,840
i i hear you i really hear you yeah

01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:46,000
it's an excellent the other issue that

01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:50,000
we have is uh being able to

01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:53,360
actually communicate with any of the

01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:57,360
national organizations so

01:54:53,360 --> 01:55:00,960
um some time ago i was trying to find

01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:05,199
somebody who was in opensuse

01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:08,320
india try as i may i couldn't

01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:11,679
it was just literally impossible

01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:12,560
i mean i met this person at opensuse

01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,480
asia

01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:18,800
but it was impossible uh

01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:20,239
and i don't know how we can stitch this

01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:23,840
together they

01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:25,199
um almost if we could have some sort of

01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,840
way of saying

01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:28,400
well you can have your autonomy but

01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,320
let's

01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,880
let's all contribute together in some

01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:35,440
way or

01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,320
i i don't know how to address it well

01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:39,199
one of the

01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:41,599
it's not a one so one of the things that

01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:42,880
stasi and i had or sassy

01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,960
i'm gonna keep messing that up for a

01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,800
little bit bear with me um

01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,560
saucy and i had talked about last year

01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,920
was um

01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:55,040
bring up of the noggin um uh uh

01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,480
login system uh and account system one

01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,000
of the things that we would change from

01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:00,960
how things work before to how it would

01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:04,719
work going forward was

01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:07,520
those groups would get the ability

01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:07,840
to have memberships declared in there

01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,880
and

01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:11,360
people who are working in those

01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:14,639
advocacies and in those teams

01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:16,400
would actually be able to maintain their

01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,440
memberships with the central opensuse

01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,800
account system

01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:23,599
it's not much but what it means is that

01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:24,480
we know how they are or where they're

01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:27,520
involved

01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:28,560
and they are much more they're easier to

01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,880
reach out to

01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,159
because we know who they are and they

01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:36,639
know who they are

01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:38,800
because up until for example up until

01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:40,159
i don't know six or seven weeks ago i

01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,760
didn't even know that there was a there

01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:45,440
was a sub organization that ran

01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:47,280
that ran opensuse events in in the us

01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:49,599
it's got one or two people but they

01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,280
exist and they run they run the opensuse

01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:53,920
booth at scale

01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:55,760
i didn't know that until only a few uh

01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:59,760
only a month or two ago

01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,760
that is appalling

01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,679
yeah we have to start from somewhere

01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,719
though like i don't know what else we

01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,960
can

01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:10,000
what are we going to solve that problem

01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,560
one thing

01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,520
one easy step one easy step we could we

01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,560
could make uh

01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:19,760
towards the the more local communities

01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:22,960
is to uh discipline ourselves

01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:26,480
so that important stuff gets translated

01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,760
into languages that are not very simple

01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:30,560
to

01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,880
to move from to english such as i don't

01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,080
know

01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:37,360
uh spanish uh perhaps russian

01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:39,119
arabic stuff like that that would that

01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:41,040
would be a nice move i think

01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:43,280
to make i'm sure we're going to make

01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,960
that at some point for the docs because

01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,760
you have no excuse not to do that for

01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,800
the docs

01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:51,199
but we could uh make this principle

01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:53,199
apply across the board and use it for

01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:57,360
important

01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:57,360
posts news posts etc

01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,760
well i believe the the new system and

01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,480
all the the stuff for blogs and

01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:06,080
and things saucy made sure that we

01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:09,440
actually can easily support

01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,880
translated versions so yeah i mean i

01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,840
agree with that that's a sentiment i

01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,920
think we should just be

01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:18,000
doing no matter what else we do but

01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,119
i think our systems now for how we

01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,760
manage

01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:23,920
news content and things like that should

01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,239
make that considerably easier now

01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,599
yeah and not only not only allow people

01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:30,639
to do this but to

01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,520
like make the first move gather with

01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,159
translators

01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:35,280
and and yeah really enforce this this

01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:37,440
policy

01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,840
it is something is very important is

01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,360
published just in case it is translated

01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,599
too

01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:45,440
yeah and you're talking about only

01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,199
announcements like you know one-time

01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:48,000
information or are you talking also

01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:50,719
about like you know

01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,400
wiki contents and how-tos and stuff so

01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,520
we start little by little of course

01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:56,960
otherwise uh

01:58:53,520 --> 01:59:00,159
it's uh it's uh bound to fail

01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,719
so little by little means uh yeah uh

01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:04,719
release announcement um

01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:06,000
the page from which you can download the

01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:09,760
distros

01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,719
and the main the the main uh tutorials

01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,960
and guides we

01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:17,599
we have in the docs so with the first

01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,679
of those those three i am first two of

01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,760
those three i think i'm i'm with you

01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,880
um but what i have seen is for example

01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,719
in the wiki

01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,560
i've seen that like you know

01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:30,800
translations to

01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:32,000
what is it the japanese ja.openswith.jpg

01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,920
something like that you know the

01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,320
contents is like so

01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:38,800
outdated compared to the english one

01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:45,840
absolutely it doesn't work for wikis

01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:45,840
so yeah subtract wikis from from my list

01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:49,840
now that we have before one of the

01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,119
things we probably should start doing is

01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:54,239
move documentation

01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:55,840
out of the wiki and into into the system

01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:57,520
where we can just regularly generate

01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,800
through ci the docs for all the

01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,960
different languages

01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,920
and give people an easy way to just send

02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,440
pull requests

02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,960
to add translated versions of

02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:07,040
documentation

02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,960
or even new documentation across the

02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,360
board that's that's exactly what's

02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:11,360
planned

02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:14,320
ahead for that we are currently on

02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:17,360
github and we will be moving to a

02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:20,080
pager uh when we are ready okay

02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,679
sounds good uh yeah we i mean i mean i

02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,400
can't speak for everyone but that's

02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,480
that's

02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:26,159
what some people among us believe and i

02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,760
think the majority

02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:29,360
will will agree with that so yeah we'll

02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,840
