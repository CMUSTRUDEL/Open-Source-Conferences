00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,040
all right um also anyone else

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,519
um we we

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
would like to record this and and stream

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
it uh if that's

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,640
if if everyone's in an agreement with

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
that i think

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
it would probably be a good thing to get

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,840
that

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,599
sort of efforts out there

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,960
to people so does anyone have a

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,280
preference on this maybe you could uh

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,079
write in the chat what you what you

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
think if you

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,520
if you don't think we should do it if or

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
does anyone have any objections that's

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,719
what i'm asking i guess

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,120
okay um

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,239
so uh i'm gonna put a few links in the

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
chat

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,480
for the various things that we have here

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,480
um i

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,200
um i have a few

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,880
[Music]

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
slides that i've put together just to

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,600
kind of like get the dialogue going but

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,479
but if we want to um

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,400
if we would like to go ahead and um veer

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,439
off into other directions

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
please feel free i'm going to go ahead

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,840
and share

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
my slides that i

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
have

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,399
so so um

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,399
can everyone see that

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
yep okay great um

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
so

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
i'll flip this

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,039
let's see here it's loading looting

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
so docker i guess you are going to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,879
present the slides now right

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,160
yeah that's that's okay good that's the

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,640
plan

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,640
yeah maybe on behalf of the board uh let

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,280
me say a big thank you

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
especially to to adrian who was running

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,040
this thing very

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
very very well and of course to all the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,120
participants here

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
uh which is i think a very important

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,040
group

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,599
that we are coming together to improve

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,040
the things on on opensuse i think

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
the survey has um received a lot of

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
perception

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
in the community not only in the open

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
source community but

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
as well in the in the general linux

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,879
community

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,440
uh that there is a project doing

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,480
something actively to listen to the user

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
and now let's

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,120
try to make the best of it and now i

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
keep my mouth shut

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,519
thanks exactly

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
um well i'm having a little bit

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
difficult time having it load

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,519
uh but i have the link there you can see

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
uh um the slideshare maybe that's why

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
many people are accessing it and that's

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:32,000
that's why it's perhaps not to

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:34,640
stealing your yeah exactly

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:47,840
um i've just i've just managed to

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:47,840
display it it's super nice

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
well it looks like it's it's working

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,040
right now so i just i have it in the

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
browser

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
just because i want to do that as a

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,239
backup but

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,159
um so these are these are sort of the uh

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,760
the things that we want to sort of

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,680
address today

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
uh looking at the steps sort of address

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,040
the pain points this is

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
kind of what was written in news uh the

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,920
news article

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
going to the knowledge transfer

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,799
promotion

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,799
outcomes et cetera so

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,759
this is the objectives for next week's

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,680
um

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
um discussion um

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,000
[Music]

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,280
and so we can go we'll go over that next

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,320
uh next saturday

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,880
and then what are we doing here you know

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,120
um

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,120
right so we're we're we want to

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
hopefully get some outcomes here maybe

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
some actionable items that we can we can

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
come together with as a community

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
also get some understanding about what

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,759
we have out there

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,759
um and these are sort of the the um

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,120
the aspects that i wanted to

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
i guess manage the expectations you know

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,080
listen listen to everyone

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,759
um provide input um

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
and and then of course you know put our

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
put our ideas that we come up with into

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,440
action

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,880
to improve the project and

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,759
going into that i wanted to address

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,960
sort of the first position or the first

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,800
thing we had on

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
on the bullet which is pain points

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,160
so with the pain points

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
you'll notice here that uh

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,520
we had variety a variety of different

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,919
things but um you know it was overall i

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
think it was spread out pretty nice uh

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,400
across

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
like what what are the various pain

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
points um

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
i guess it would probably be better if

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,680
we could like limit down to two or three

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
but you know that's

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,759
um it seems like there are pain points

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,360
across across the entire spectrum

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:16,720
so the docs aspect that's a

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
issue that has been discussed

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,039
and then i've had quite a few

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
people reach out to me um based on a few

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,759
of the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,360
uh yeah the few of the few of the pain

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
points that that i think are really

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,639
discussed

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,520
uh amongst the community and

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,880
um you know i think at some point it's

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,720
really like

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
how do we change that and that that's

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,440
that's is relatively important so

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,160
um i'm also one i also wanted to

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,360
show some of the other difficulties uh

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
this was a different

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
sort of a different question but it

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,840
still kind of kind of hit on

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
um some of those points uh

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,039
you know communication like where do we

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,560
where do we send people

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,280
um how do we how do we want to

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,479
communicate

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,759
as a project i mean it is pretty spread

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,479
out you know all the channels that we

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
have

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
which was also really really interesting

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,440
to see all

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,000
the variety of different ways people

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,400
actually um

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
actually talk and communicate with one

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
another or get their news and things of

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,960
that nature

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
um so these are sort of the questions

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,039
that i wanted to

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,319
draw out from from everyone that's

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,360
attending like

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,520
um what's you know what we can do

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
um are the things that we want to

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,199
consider

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
we have the um we have the ether pad

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,440
and the questions

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
uh on that i believe are the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
yeah the questions from the slide so so

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
if we want we could we could probably go

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
into

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
into that um

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
yes

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,840
does anyone have any comment about that

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,080
any input so uh

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,720
just to be clear um which slides do you

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
are you in

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
exactly i mean you move from the slide

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
to the

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
ether pad

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,479
so it would be uh the second link from

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
the bottom

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
are you okay

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
so

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,160
so i guess i could go back to the slides

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
that we had

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
nice

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,399
so just by the way so that everyone is

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,279
on the same page how do we organize um

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,640
like taking taking the floor do we do we

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:50,160
raise our hand

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:52,480
virtually or uh

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,480
yes

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
that would work so do i need any stop

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:19,839
sharing my screen you're going to just

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:19,839
share the slides

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,000
so i i think uh

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,600
you could we could just i think there's

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
enough people here that

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
you could just speak and ask questions

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,160
okay

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
because yeah everyone should be uh

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,360
should feel free to

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,320
like uh interrupt politely and and

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,200
to say anything i think because we are

00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:01,839
we can manage

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,839
i think this workflow

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,760
so but okay so just um so should we

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,240
do what do you suggest should we go

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,200
through um

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
a specific point now or should we like

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
um

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,560
uh do some q a with with everyone

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
um to perhaps collect questions or

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
perhaps collect suggestions

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
before anything else perhaps clarify

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,519
things

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,279
if people want to have clarifications

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
i think yeah i think that'd be fine i

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,240
know i know that um there's also

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,040
the of the links there's also a lot of

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
other questions

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,079
that you'd put together as well so i

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,040
mean like

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
yeah you know yeah sure i mean your

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,200
thoughts and my thoughts and

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
everyone else who has yeah so so just

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
yeah

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
to everyone uh now here so we have

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,040
already a

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,560
a bunch of suggestions uh

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
sketches of ids etc so we can go in many

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,880
direction from here

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,920
but it would be nice if everyone was

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,720
um had the opportunity to to make an

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
input

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,120
uh so that yeah you you don't have just

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
to follow what

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
like the vocal people do uh be nice i

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,120
think

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,800
but yeah so yeah

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,880
so perhaps myself i could ask you a

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,320
question how do you think

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,720
um so assuming um we we get some

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,920
agreement on priorities etc

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
uh how do we how do we do we make these

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,320
suggestions in id

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,839
actionable how do we make people work on

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
that because we are volunteers so

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
perhaps

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
perhaps you have ideas about that just

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,240
to so that we know that what's

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,519
at stake here um

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,279
so i i would say we could record them in

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,519
the ether pad

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
and then probably put them in to

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,120
progress that opensuse.org oh yeah

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
that's the sort of the common thing that

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
we could

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
i think most of the things have been run

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
like that in the past so

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,800
unless someone else has another idea but

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
i think that's probably a good

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,839
good way of doing it and and i would

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
probably

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,880
i would recommend perhaps recording it

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,880
on

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,920
the ether pad that has the

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
end of year 2020 meetup so i can put

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,639
that in there as

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:38,720
sort of actions

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,279
okay by the way i'm taking minutes so um

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
we have a safety a fail safe in case we

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,160
lose a

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
recording capabilities

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,760
okay nice so yeah

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
um

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,800
um so yeah

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,480
is there i mean among the people here

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
any question

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,800
uh about what's been discussed so far

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,760
and if not

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,560
maybe we we move on duke with uh the

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,560
slides you've

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,800
prepared

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,240
well should we go into the questions

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
about the about the pain points that we

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,519
have there

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,279
okay to draw draw some stuff out um

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
do i have a question can you hear me

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,760
yeah yeah sure

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,680
so i just wonder um do we actually have

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
a way to contact people

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,720
about you know their responses to

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
actually collect further information

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,079
because i'm seeing one pain point here

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,199
that says

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,199
um hardware badly or not supported

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,959
but obviously we can't actually address

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320
that without understanding like which

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,680
hardware people are actually

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,279
talking about yeah sure

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,800
so so the short answer is no we

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,839
we don't have the ability to consolidate

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,760
data to make inferences that would tell

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,079
us exactly

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,160
the situation of those people who have

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,600
reported difficulties with

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,760
hardware support so yeah

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,040
it doing that would have required a

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,120
different

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,680
design in the survey um

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
so yeah but i mean all hope is not lost

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,360
we can

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
we can find different strategies to

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,920
perhaps solicit these users in

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,519
particular with another survey or

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,839
more informally through channels etc

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,800
andreas would you um seeing that this is

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,600
like the point that you bring up

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
um you know this is also like looking at

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,480
progress

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,600
at future surveys so so we have this as

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,440
a template that we that we put together

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,480
with the survey perhaps so what uber

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
had done for the arm survey earlier was

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,279
to allow

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,519
people to you know for one have like a

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,160
free text comment field at the end

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
but also the option to actually specify

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,440
a contact email

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
that would then allow at least the

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,560
admins of the

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,680
of the survey to you know reach out to

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,680
people if necessary

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,920
yeah so if that was not done this time

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,639
that may be an idea to consider for the

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,120
next story

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,839
yeah it's it's very true uh we've tried

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,880
to

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,480
like go to the essential and

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,040
um it's not exactly a benchmark that is

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,240
meant to be scientifically accurate as

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
far as

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,079
um hardware issue we had we had to cut

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,720
some corners

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,360
and sadly that was one of the corners

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,880
that

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,360
was cut um but

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
yeah because and so also one of the

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
thing is it's one among many other

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
points

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,160
uh pain points i mean so yeah

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,600
but i mean so for instance we could say

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
okay let's um

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
let's try to to to fill this this

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
loophole

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,240
and let's make a team of of people that

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,799
will just

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,240
uh try to extract this information from

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,280
the community that would be

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
a project itself

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,959
further furthermore we have the option

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,039
to

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,319
since we have um survey.opensouza.org

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:30,080
we do have the option to also

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,080
do another specific

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
questionnaire based on that topic if we

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:47,840
want to dive deeper into that

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:47,840
as well yeah

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
um

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,360
yeah perhaps so one of the

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
yeah no i'll keep this question for

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,600
later it's fine

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
okay um

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,280
so i guess um going going into

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,640
the addressing the pain points we have

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,720
um

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,440
you know ideas ideas to address pain

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,559
points probably a better one is um

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,559
uh the rather than going that go into

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
three what what are some areas uh we

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,880
could address immediately based on the

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
pain points

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
i mean documentation tends to be one of

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,559
those things but it's also

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,760
um i think in one of my examples there

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,880
on the slides um there was a mention

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,440
that

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,919
the um there's some old documentation

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
uh but some people don't really think

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
it's a good idea to delete the

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,799
information because you don't really

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,760
know

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,080
how many people are actually still using

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
that

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
info

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,559
absolutely so yeah and and

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
so this is one problem with we are

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,440
trying to overcome with

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,640
the new documentation which is uh under

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,039
construction

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,320
and this is the problem of of the

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,799
documentation

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,000
as is presented on the wikis on the

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,440
wikis you don't know

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,960
how up to date uh an information can be

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,600
and you don't know how official it is so

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,240
you're always struggling with um

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,640
skepticism in a way because

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,000
you don't know at which point you will

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
run into something which is

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,480
out of date um outdated

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,240
or not officially endorsed so

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,760
it creates kind of a but yeah

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,880
it it feeds it feeds skepticism

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,200
and we have to overcome that and that we

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,679
we we're making this new uh revamped

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,039
talk so to speak on github

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,520
and um yeah the idea is to move to a

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,080
more

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,760
maintainer-centric model so that people

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
can have faith

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,159
in what is actually presented but that

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,280
doesn't solve another issue with the

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,520
wiki which is and not the wiki

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,320
particularly but in general the web

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
platform

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,080
it's not easy to navigate there are many

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,400
different things

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,000
you have the official official handbooks

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,720
you have the

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,360
wikis the different and then the wiki is

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,480
broken up is broken into

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,120
dumbly we'd leap etc so maybe we could i

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
don't know do

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,480
something about yeah helping people

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
navigate the wiki

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
and to find their way to the what

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
they're actually

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
looking for

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:59,200
it's a navigation point

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,919
yeah so we have to basically put

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
ourselves in the shoes of the newcomer

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,760
and

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,120
yeah try to like imagine what the path

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,400
they would follow and make sure this

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,520
path is as

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,080
smooth as possible in

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
i mean this i'm not exactly a newcomer

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,600
but whenever i look for for

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,520
anything even i get confused because

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,000
that to me it looks like there's two

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,799
home pages

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,679
there's the regular web page and there's

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,520
a wiki

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,280
and both look like they have

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,919
like their own starting pages and i

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,559
think having one primary entry point

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,360
which maybe what you what you had in

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,000
mind but having one primary entry point

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,600
from where you then can go i think would

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,640
go

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,600
would go a great length helping

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
helping navigate

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah absolutely

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,960
maybe they have some something to teach

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,000
us about this

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,400
want to share with us

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
well i know that uh for the at least for

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
the home page

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,280
landing page we're looking at um

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,400
directing people towards

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
communication areas whether that be

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,200
telegram

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,080
discord um

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,159
things of that nature um this support

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,159
mailing lists um

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,799
that doesn't necessarily answer the

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,440
question it doesn't direct

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,440
toward a specific entry point

00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,400
and i think also based on my own

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,600
experience but but in general i think

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,559
that's good but if if you can help

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
get to the answer right away that's even

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,559
better

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
because there is lots of information um

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
and

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
and when you go to a mailing list or

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,080
disclaimer whatever that induces an

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,159
additional

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,919
step you need to take which some may be

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,200
hesitant to do

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,200
um but it also adds a time step

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,960
so i i think it's good

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
and to make this very prominent for

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,720
cases where

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,200
we don't offer that we don't have the

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,480
answers yet

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,640
but but i don't think it

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,520
removes the need to make things easier

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,840
to access

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,840
and and information more complete

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,440
yeah of course i agree

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,240
um i mean it's out of the blue and it's

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,279
sorry for the naive question but do we

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,640
have something

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,480
planned already uh about

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,000
simplifying our web um platform

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,000
is it something that's already in the

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,640
pipe and we are actually

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,120
beating a dead horse now or is it

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,840
something

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
really new

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,679
um i guess i could probably answer

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,400
that to the i mean i know i know that

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
there are

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,440
discussions about

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,760
changing the homepage

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,760
changingsoftware.opensouza.org a bit

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:50,000
and that also goes into the

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,960
yeah the overall design of the logos and

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,440
things of that nature

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
is going into it i mean it's work in

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,400
progress there's no um

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,039
there's no exact uh deadline that we're

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,240
looking at

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,240
like when this is gonna happen so uh

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,760
from that standpoint that that's about

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,320
as best of information i can give you

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,039
all right i wouldn't mind some so much

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,080
about the tools or technology

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,320
um for me it's like um when i started

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,320
with open source i was quite confused

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
confused to find the right information

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,919
so for me there's one single entry point

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,480
that's

00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,960
opensuse.org right yeah so if i go there

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,679
i'm

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,919
greeted and i don't mind about the

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,320
design i think it's actually a nice

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
design and all that is fine but i only

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,880
see tools

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,279
news conferences but the first thing i

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,919
would look into is like where's an faq

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,799
was some documentation and it is there

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
but i have to

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,559
search that again so for me it took kind

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,559
of ages to just get convinced to try out

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,600
opensuse because i couldn't find

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,240
all the basic things that i usually need

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
to

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
find and then as adrian already said

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,080
it's like

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
um after some searching you will find

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,200
all those

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
like loose links that are dangling

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
around if they would be present in the

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,760
start page it would be awesome

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
and after that time you just encounter

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
the wiki and

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,720
let's be honest the wiki is always

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,960
outdated and

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,039
for weekly it's like okay as long as

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,200
it's not contradicting to other

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:28,480
news or news sources and it's okay

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,480
and if i see some instructions on the

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
wiki page i would always try to

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,720
double check that with the official

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,799
basic documentation and see which one

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,919
is it covered there and um if it's

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,760
covered there then i would

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,679
trust more the official one instead of

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,320
the wiki and if i have some time i would

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
maybe also adjust the wiki and just

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,640
correct that one but i think that the

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,400
basic

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,919
showstopper for me in the beginning was

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,400
to find that

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,440
documentation because i can't directly

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,240
see anything on the start page

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,880
uh this was kind of already discussed in

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
into the communication room on telegram

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,480
and

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,120
i have to say that every time we kind of

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,840
uh go into complicated different

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,880
direction with

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
with the ideas and and how we actually

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,520
want to

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,039
accomplish revamping

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
the open source arc

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,480
so the fact that that now we are

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,399
specifically having easier access to

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,399
documentation

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,520
it's not exactly the new idea but

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,200
it's not like this was ever a

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,080
consideration as a

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,960
as the main point of of making open

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,159
source talk better

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,520
and if we if we had that if we

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,840
if we had that idea what exactly

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,200
uh the main page of the project should

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,720
actually

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,679
present and and what exactly we should

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,600
include on that page to direct people in

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,080
the correct direction

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,200
it would be great it would make my life

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,520
easier

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,679
actually making that webpage happen

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,320
yeah once you you booted already opens

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,080
user then we have a nice welcome screen

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,520
that's too late yeah but that's exactly

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
where you get the documentation then

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,159
yeah

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,720
exactly that's uh let me finish

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
this is basically a very well done

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,000
navigation tool i think

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,960
all right you need for the for the main

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,600
page is something like a getting started

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,960
section right right which tells you

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,880
what may be the flavor that is

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,200
interesting to you how do you download

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
it

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,399
how do you install it somewhere

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,120
here find the basic steps and we have of

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,320
course this

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,880
section about installation of

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,760
multimedia codecs which is a pain point

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,360
basically for

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,720
every beginner but here we have some

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,480
some legal restrictions as i understand

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,799
we had a discussion a couple of

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,399
weeks or months ago whether we couldn't

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,760
include this

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,919
in the distro as well but this uh faded

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,760
away a little bit the discussion

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,399
and gerrard maybe a question to you

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,440
do you see an option that we contact for

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,799
example

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,840
kirian to get a legal

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,679
advice whether it is possible to provide

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,200
just a link

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,360
in the installation tool

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,039
to instantly install this codex and so

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,120
on

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,240
mixing up two things nevertheless so

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,720
getting started page

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:55,840
i think would be uh or getting started

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,840
section would be a good start

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:09,840
that's really good feedback

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:24,720
i mean we have we have the codex and um

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,919
in a wiki don't we yeah

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,080
i mean are they okay there in the i mean

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,600
is it correct there because no matter

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,840
where i'm searching i get different

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,840
uh answers on how to install the codecs

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,799
at least i i think it's contradicting

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,760
there's the wiki page

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,760
there's the forum

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,600
there's um the starter guide for

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,080
opensuse which is kde only related so if

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,559
i

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,000
um it used to have gnome in the past two

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,120
but now it's only kde

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,159
so the instructions should be only

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,440
applied for kde

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,039
not for gnome and there's this

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,840
package where you can do this

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,840
automatically

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
see

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,279
yeah there's also the series you're

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,799
talking about the um

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,600
the open souza dash guide.org

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,600
um exactly yeah yeah we don't we don't

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,279
um

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,039
someone takes care of that and i'm not

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,960
quite sure who actually owns that

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,960
but we don't yeah

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,159
so i'm not sure about the legal impact

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,440
i'm i'm okay that it's not included

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,720
uh and if it's legally okay

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,480
to give a precise description

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,919
how to get the codex in there correctly

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
then that would be fine

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,320
okay i i i'll make a note here

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,240
and i'll actually follow up on this with

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,080
jiren he's sort of the lawyer that

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,039
checks all of her stuff

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,080
and having a good you know is actually

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,159
brought up having a good

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,640
like um okay

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
at least having our uh having us covered

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,960
to say okay yes this is

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,559
a good idea uh if if it isn't then we'll

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,880
have to think of an alternative i guess

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,880
yes

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,840
can you call can you copy me on that

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
please

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:13,760
then don't ask let's just leave things

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,760
as they are

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,760
if i may just come back to um stasic's

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,600
point

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,399
about making his life easier as far as

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,960
designing the web pages um perhaps

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,320
perhaps we are

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,720
we we are mixing too many things

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,720
we want our main entry point to be the

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,880
entry point of too many things

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,799
distro community stuff such as news

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,559
events etc and also all the opensuse

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,559
products such as openqa

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,840
or uni etc so i don't know one solution

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
would be to

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,960
i mean have different sub-domains

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,360
for each of these things um

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,240
it's one way of doing it there are other

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,960
ways but

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,359
perhaps perhaps we're biting a bit a bit

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,679
uh

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,560
too much with our opensuse.org

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,560
current web page

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,240
well if you ask me um i

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,839
i would be fine if there's just a link

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,839
even if it's somewhere in in

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:33,200
lower font size letter somewhere

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,839
i'm to to to have a link because um

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,720
it's good to have a single entry point

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,480
and that would be for me in

00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,399
opensuse.org but then i would like to

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,000
see okay where's the documentation

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,159
yeah maybe there's an faq i see that

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,079
there's a wiki link already there

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,399
that is fine there's a link to the um

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,480
forum that's nice too

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,079
to the mailing list but why isn't the

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,399
documentation linked there

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,640
yeah it should be something like uh

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,720
tumblrweed or leap or

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,800
want to know more yeah and then

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,640
a button to the docs or something but

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,480
then again which docs because

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,440
tumbleweed uh strictly speaking doesn't

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,440
have

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,160
a full comprehensive official

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,320
documentation only

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,720
yeah yeah exactly and it's spread across

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,980
many different pages

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,839
so

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,640
[Music]

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,079
things are in under construction so it's

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,720
very difficult to

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,119
to make clear-cut decisions as far as

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,119
design

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,280
tough stuff

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,280
and then to some degree uh i kind of

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,760
want

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,960
to also because i i know it this is

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:57,520
a touch problematic because our

00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:03,040
webpage www

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,040
oh so opensuse.org is not

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:11,599
can't contain everything about

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,720
about our distros so i kind of wanted to

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,280
move basically all of the content

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,400
related to distribution specifically

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,119
to another web page so we can

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,079
properly explain pretty much everything

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,200
about

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,680
about the distributions uh

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,440
and link to that page basically as the

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,480
main thing that that's on the

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,920
on the opensuse.org

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,839
so that uh instead of instead of trying

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,119
to

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:47,200
fit at the moment for distributions

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,359
and on who knows how many platforms

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,280
we would have one single page where we

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,400
have informations about

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,240
information about leap

00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,599
cubic micro os and

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,640
all of that uh properly explained

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,400
instead of having

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,599
at the moment we have a lot of wikipedi

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,359
wiki pages

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,720
with portals about every single

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:16,480
distribution

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:19,400
we have we have micros.opensuse.org

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,760
which is explaining macro os we have

00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,839
cubic.arc which explains cubic

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,839
we have software.opensources.org which

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,880
explains to some degree

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,680
tumble with the nib and

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,359
a lot of different wiki pages around

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,200
different places and of course

00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:41,200
www.opensuse.org explains some

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:45,520
tumblr written leap which is a lot of

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,720
things and it's really hard to

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
comprehend for for anybody not to

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,800
mention

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,800
not to mention a new user

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,280
so at the moment get.org

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,040
is under construction and i hope

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,680
it's in a shape that's usable

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,720
uh later this year so like i don't know

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,680
months or two

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,839
when i feel like implementing the

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,680
remaining

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,880
things related to

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,359
i don't i think what's left is sleep and

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,359
cubic

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,440
and yeah we

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,240
it's a lot of work and and i'm slowly

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,160
going through all of that so we have a

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,200
single entry point for distributions at

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,880
the very least

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,400
and so we don't have to rely on

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,359
so many different places to

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,810
actually explain our distributions to

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,520
people

00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,240
[Music]

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,640
and very cool and and that single entry

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,920
point

00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:02,560
would be get.opensuse.org

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,760
yes that's correct um nice

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,160
i might just say something here uh from

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,599
the point of new users

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,040
um or people who are coming to the

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,440
distribution

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,200
they're invariably going to come to

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,720
opensuse.org and

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,920
um i really believe

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,880
that we should be saying something right

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,079
on that opening page as to what all the

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,280
branches are

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:37,280
and what the branches do

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,480
because at the moment the only thing you

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,000
really see is

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,359
the tumbleweed and leak without any real

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,720
explanation as to what uh what either of

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,920
those two

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,520
um uh those two forks mean you you then

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,960
have to scroll down and down and down

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,400
and down and down to see all the rest of

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,000
the stuff

00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,119
um uh and even

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,240
even as a uh an old long-time

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,200
social user i never go there i can't

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,000
find anything there

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,119
i i tend to go straight to google to try

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,880
and find stuff

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,720
which i appreciate is what we're trying

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,520
to resolve here

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,880
um so it's something that we really need

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,599
to think about i

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,760
i feel anyway that you know we need to

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,000
sort of say well you know

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,400
tumbleweed leading edge cubic

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,520
and then what each of those do and then

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,520
then go into the deeper websites

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,520
just just just my opinion guys

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,440
yeah i think i think that's that's that

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,920
i mean

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,560
the original i don't know how many

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,839
people here were part of the original

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,319
change of why we have that web page now

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,079
the landing page versus the old one that

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,240
some of you may have remembered

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,839
but that was more of a more of a

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
marketing aspect but

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,319
we definitely it's always good to

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,800
revisit these things and

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,760
see you know what what can be improved

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,440
and

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,839
and i think you make a lot of valid

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
points there

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:16,240
so how to do that is really

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,240
the question right

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,599
so but i mean yeah there are many ways

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,440
we can move from here

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,760
one is uh how many what's the the work

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,480
the the the workforce the work power

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,400
that we can

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,839
have to um to to help uh

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,040
if he wants help it's not for me to say

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,400
but i think it would be would be

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,119
sad if only one people had to carry the

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,599
burden of

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,000
of integrating all these things and

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,359
making all the design choices because it

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,359
sounds quite overwhelming to me

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,920
would would a maybe a workshop work

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,079
every now and then like a quarterly

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,319
workshop or something where we all could

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,280
a sprint session yeah something like

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,480
that exactly

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,040
yeah what's not about that's not a bad

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,839
idea

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,319
honestly we the main problem i usually

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,440
have

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,680
and uh that's

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,640
a little bit problematic is that i

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,920
cannot write

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,960
content for any website and it's it's

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,119
just

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,319
impossible for me to actually explain

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,640
things and

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,640
and so somebody that that writes some

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,839
actual content for the website

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,400
and not isn't just a person that does

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,359
graphical stuff and because i can do

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,119
that

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,319
it would be great also uh i will remind

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,000
you

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,800
i use datum and not he

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,800
you're sorry what

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,160
i use they dem pronouns and it's not he

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,359
sorry sorry no problem

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,400
so so was that good says like like a

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,480
would you would you be okay with like

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,040
doing a maybe a quarterly meetup or

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,160
something

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,760
or sprint yes yes yes yes absolutely

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,760
that would be preferable

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,640
i would uh i would love if we had some

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
eyes on this every quarter so we can

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,280
actually

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,280
fix the things that that are

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,839
update things that that come up and

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,400
and have some improvements to the

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,400
website

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,359
websites not just not just maybe this

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,440
one but

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,920
in the future we may have some more

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,400
things to actually

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,400
add to the website

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,079
so stasic does it mean that you would be

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,160
you would agree to like

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,960
have i mean to to show people the ropes

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,160
of your work

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,760
and to welcome them and to yeah

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,920
share your knowledge with them so that

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,520
they can help you

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,000
something like that uh

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,040
i would expand on that because if i

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,319
wasn't as

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:13,920
busy as i am this year i would probably

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,680
also mentor somebody on uh

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,040
google summer of code but i don't have

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,119
the time so

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,240
so that's not that's kind of possible

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,280
but if

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,480
it's about some you know uh

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,680
off and on uh collaboration that that

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,880
i can do in at any time and and

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,760
don't have to actually be

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,280
too involved i would say that would be

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,319
great

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,440
so like lightly mentor them

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:51,839
yes very lightly

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:51,839
nice okay i'm writing this down

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,920
um so i think at least from that that

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,319
seems like we can move on to

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,839
either one that did the like another

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,240
topic and the pain points

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:09,599
um or we can go to to something else

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,839
um i i know the

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,880
lars had pointed out like creating

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,200
another

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,240
additional surveys for the pain points

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,400
that sounds

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,520
that sounds like also a good idea just

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,119
to

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,480
expand and extract some of that

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,480
information uh

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,400
we have to give it give it some thought

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,560
but but that i i kind of like that

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,760
but currently what we also have you know

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,319
uh

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,960
going to i think it was slide six where

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,079
you know we have the

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:46,240
installation uh hardware mentioned uh

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,920
desktop environment settings uh that's

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
something perhaps we could probably

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,240
share with the

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
desktop um

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:02,960
with other desktop projects um

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
which would be nice um

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,599
the open sou's a specific uh settings

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,480
would would was it also an area i think

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,880
that would be interesting

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,880
unable to find software i think comes

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,960
into uh

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:25,620
um one of those

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,839
um areas that people might not fully

00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,319
[Music]

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,920
understand and

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,920
if anyone has any any

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,000
points about that like you like

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,800
it would it'd be nice if you could speak

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,160
up

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,400
you know because i think a lot of the

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,440
times we'll have people go and they'll

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,359
just see

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,000
the package and and software that 0.00

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,079
and um you know not not know the the

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,640
official release or they're

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,240
you know doing something uh loading

00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,520
package from someone else's home

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,160
repository

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,160
home project

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:11,040
and that was a discussion during the

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,040
workshop at uh

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,880
conference 2019 uh during the

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:22,319
software workshop and

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,520
we came up with some ideas but because

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,359
there aren't enough people actually

00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,800
doing a lot of things that that are

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,640
required because

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,599
of course people don't have the time

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,200
they need to to implement them

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:40,480
those things kind of died and we

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,839
there there are some actual ideas

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,040
how to uh

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:50,400
how to maybe improve the situation

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,400
make it easier for people to notify

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
the maintainers that there is uh there

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,280
is a need that this package

00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,400
lands in factory for example but

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,680
because and and also some

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,079
commenting infrastructure so people can

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,359
share

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,480
about what packages work what doesn't

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:14,160
and and stuff like that

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:18,079
this is all kind of on hold until we can

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,079
uh we can

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,040
fix issues and not introduce new

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,839
problems but

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,520
uh this has to be implemented this

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,480
should be implemented in

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
in software oh oh at some point even

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,200
though

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,079
it has been more than a year since since

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,359
that

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,920
in that workshop this is still on back

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,240
burner

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:49,119
and it needs to be done at some point

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:51,280
it's okay um

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,440
so we had uh other things we have our

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,160
configuration software

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,960
a lack of of clear best practices you

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,079
know that that's

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,079
um that's about the docs

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,000
something else and with that we could

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,400
probably

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,760
move on to uh which which is probably

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,400
also important would be the

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,920
the i think knowledge transfer like

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,599
getting to that would probably be a good

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,640
a good idea

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,200
um yeah i think we could kind of

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,720
like i think we have some good movement

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,160
with the pain points

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,920
where we could go to and and that's

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,240
a very nice idea we can just uh there's

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,119
just something a small point we could

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,160
talk about

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,520
because it still really concerns the

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,559
web pages which is um

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,440
how do we get people to pick the right

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,359
installation image it's something so

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,920
just to give people some context

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,680
there's been a review actually many

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,880
reviews but one in particular that

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,240
strikes out

00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,599
about opensuse which was

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,040
i mean it was it was uh okay

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,319
um and the reviewers spent a lot of time

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,960
talking about

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,839
this first hand experience of choosing

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,720
the installation image

00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,359
downloading uh going through the

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,480
installation process etc and

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,880
apparently what what um the message that

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,400
this

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:26,160
this review uh conveyed was that it was

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,960
not a very easy and smooth process

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,599
to select the right image to know which

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,800
one one

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,240
one is supposed to use

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,319
and to get it learning so and and this

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,559
in particular the first part of this

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,760
selecting the right image is very much

00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,760
about the web platform

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,079
so yeah we should make it we should make

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,280
it easier for people to

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,280
just see what they need

00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:01,200
um so

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,440
and this breaks this breaks into many

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,160
sub-points so for instance

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,559
can we really expect people to never use

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
the

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,480
live image because we kind of we will

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,119
kind of

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,000
discard discouraging the use of live

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,599
images for

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,280
installation instead we direct people to

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,480
the normal install installer

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,079
should we change that so you're talking

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,400
if i get you're correct you're talking

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,119
about software.opensuse.org yeah yeah

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
exactly

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,480
and which image should be in and that's

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,760
yeah

00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:38,720
yeah exactly so we have so we can just

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,720
open this right now

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,119
so for instance uh if you go i don't

00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,400
know gumbleweed

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:51,520
um so software.opensource.org

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,599
slash distributions slash tumblrweed

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,960
so you have a tab which is called

00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,520
installation

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,359
very nice so you have dvd image network

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,079
image

00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,079
and it's fairly intuitive what the

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,480
distinction means between the two and

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:10,160
also the distinction between the

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,200
the cpu architecture so no problem there

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,200
the problem is

00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,559
okay you have this step you also have a

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,520
tab called

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,760
live which says please be aware of the

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,640
following limitations of the live images

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,200
they should not be

00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,240
used to install or upgrade tumbleweed

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,960
and that thing

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,760
is already so yeah there are two

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,200
problems

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,440
one problem is okay you have

00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,359
installation tab and you have live tab

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
okay so which one because people are

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,040
used to use the live tab

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,040
especially if they come from ubuntu

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,119
and the second problem is okay why are

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,119
you telling me that i cannot install

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,599
i expected i was i would be able to

00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,040
install from the live image

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,400
and then when you ask the devs which

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,079
i've done uh it's not a clear-cut story

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,319
you have arguments for you have

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,559
arguments against

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,280
allowing and recommending people to use

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,280
the live image

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,559
i i stopped that i stopped there i've

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,280
already spoken too much but

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,280
you see the thing

00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,960
yeah that was also mentioned on the the

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,240
linux and plugged

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,800
uh podcast yeah two or three weeks ago

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,079
and

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,839
yeah this is this is perfectly right and

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,640
then and the summary of the

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,000
the linux unblocked review was also

00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,800
asked what can we do for

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,319
example to include more drivers for

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,319
example in the live images

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,480
because that that seems to be a limiting

00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
factor i mean at the moment they are

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,800
about 900 megabyte

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,960
so there should be some space left and

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,680
to be honest i don't know

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,880
um it's maybe one of the packages for

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,920
this just live images here in the corner

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,680
who could answer that question so the

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,640
official answer from the

00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,520
from the engineers is the live image

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,880
goes through

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:08,160
less tests from open qa

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,160
than its installation can to port

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,359
that's the idea so yes live image also

00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,760
gets some

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:19,119
tests but less than the non-live image

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,640
and that's why official that's the

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,800
reason why it's not recommended for

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,119
installation purposes

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,880
but anyway why are people using a live

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,319
image typically they are using it

00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,920
because they want to check whether

00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,640
this distribution is running on their

00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,920
hardware so the mutation of drivers is

00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,040
really

00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,799
probably a problem here

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,960
and i can't really follow the the

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,760
argument from the from the engineers

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,400
because

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,319
the whole distribution the whole dvd

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,720
image is being tested

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,400
i mean most of the stuff is already on

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,640
the live image as well

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,440
so we need to make sure that the live

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,799
image

00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,160
boots probably uh properly on on most of

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,400
the hardware and has

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,440
as much of the stuff included and for

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,000
the rest we should

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,200
probably take a look at the dvd image

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,520
for the tests

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,440
i mean if they they fail in the dvd they

00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,319
are most likely to fail in the

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,319
live image as well

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,319
yeah how am i wrong

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,240
i mean we can speculate but but yeah

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,640
it's

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,599
it's it's difficult if unless we have an

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,280
engineer

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:33,040
with us now possibly i i

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,200
have been using live images

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,200
quite a lot and

00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,760
[Music]

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,799
perhaps one of the angles that that we

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,240
need to think about

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:47,280
is uh the live edge image works well

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,240
in a scenario where you have multiple

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,920
machines that

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:55,900
you want to bring up quickly

00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,280
for a specific reason

00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,319
[Music]

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,319
so i have

00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,960
a use case where we've got a lot of

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:10,640
machines

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:13,280
and i tend to use the live image

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,280
as as as a quick start rather than

00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,720
trying to

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:22,400
create a usb driven machine

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:25,760
that can then get rolled out to

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,480
about 50 different machines

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,520
that's that's a scenario that i wonder

00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,480
if people

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,760
have thought about uh one of the reasons

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,720
i

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,200
went to a live image was that i found

00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,319
that

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,839
in some ways the live images for

00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,839
whatever reason

00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,839
can be uh

00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,240
much easier to install in or or roll out

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,400
because

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:57,599
they seem to come pre-packaged with um

00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,760
let's say more forgiving drivers

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:05,359
um just putting it out there

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:09,119
um for a long time i've

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:12,000
i felt that uh um one of the big

00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,200
downfalls of opensuse was we never had a

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,799
live image

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,559
and then when it came along i thought it

00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,680
was one of the best things that happened

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,920
it really did

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,280
make a big difference so i'm quite

00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,839
surprised to

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,079
hear that um the live images get less

00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:28,000
testing

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,799
because in my experience they're usually

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,720
a bit more compatible

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,960
or maybe a bit more because they're a

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:39,040
bit more up to date

00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,040
um just my two cents worth guys

00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,000
newly noted and what what came to my

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,920
mind is i mean if i

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,599
insert install the system i mostly use

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,559
the net installer

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,160
and this is just a minimum setup and

00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,200
pulls the rest

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,720
from from the net so

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,559
the software that's being installed

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,280
there is just mostly the same off

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,960
as of the on the on the dvd image plus

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,280
some additional stuff

00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,599
and i do not see the big difference i

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,520
mean the net installer i don't even know

00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,720
whether it's being tested or not

00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,319
but i mean it it should boot the live

00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,920
part should boot and of course the

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,760
installation part would boot

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,880
the rest in between of the software i

00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,440
think it should be don't care for us

00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,440
more or less

00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:34,240
so just a uh also a general question

00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,520
to know what's at stake here so it's

00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,520
again one of these

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,880
integration problem because we have

00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,559
engineers we have

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,559
people that build images we have the

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,200
website that displays them

00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,160
how should we go about how should we

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,140
come together

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,520
on this i mean

00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,680
[Music]

00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,319
is it something that the board could

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,640
push or

00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,960
because it's not going to magically

00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,960
happen overnight

00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,480
and yet it should in a way because we

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,839
have to fix this

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,640
so people from the board so for instance

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,119
you axel

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,000
um what's your take on this how do we

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,200
best

00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,200
push this this change

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,400
good question um

00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:25,599
if it's a matter of qa testing

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:28,960
we could maybe talk to the guys of uh

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:32,240
of open qa um whatever good

00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,559
comes to my mind was

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,799
giving i think on friday the workshop as

00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,799
well

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,440
um

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:46,480
but i i really don't see the testing as

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,760
them as the major topic

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,359
but i

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,520
see more the integration of additional

00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,680
drivers so maybe duck could

00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:01,839
put an action item on me i talked to

00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,839
oliver kurtz

01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:09,839
right so if you actually check on

01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,839
openqa.opensuse.org for tumbleweed

01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:14,160
in the i don't know second to last

01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:16,480
snapshots that already been run through

01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,559
i find at least you know seven test

01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,319
cases for the gnome live medium

01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,240
if you scroll down that page so it's not

01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,920
like there are no tests

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,920
it may just not be you know a full

01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,480
duplication of all the tests that are

01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,839
being run

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,839
on the installer

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,319
yeah and in this context where we talk

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,240
about

01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:39,599
image building and so on and so on i

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,720
still wonder

01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,079
why don't we have monthly rebuild of the

01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,280
leap installation

01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,280
dvd for example

01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:56,319
anybody an idea i mean if you

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,319
you're downloading after a year on

01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,599
nearly short before the next release is

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:03,599
coming let's sing

01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,599
now a 15.2

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:10,319
dvd and try to install it and have

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:13,280
issues with all the drivers and

01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,680
what do i know it's quite likely that

01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,400
updated drivers have already been pushed

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,520
through the update channel so why not to

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,720
include them

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,839
instantly in a new build of the

01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:30,079
the dvd that cannot be too

01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:34,640
also as best

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,640
uh stuff being rebuilt every day

01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,559
i think lubash i don't know if he's here

01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,839
um

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,119
he would definitely be able to answer

01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:47,680
that question so

01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:50,960
i mean we we surely can propose it on

01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,640
on the enterprise side from susanne's

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,319
enterprise we

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:58,880
we started to move to quarterly updates

01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,720
so it was yearly service specs and then

01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,440
um

01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:06,480
as you explained it it does make sense

01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,640
to have something in between

01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,559
there's a balance because you do you do

01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,559
want need to test

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,480
and there's also think of mirrors and

01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,119
download

01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,559
you probably you probably want slash

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,559
need to make the older

01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,559
previous versions available for a bit

01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,480
which is not so much the case for

01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,319
tumbleweed so if you

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:32,319
if you did it like every day then you

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,839
people couldn't probably wouldn't be

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,559
able to download what they used two

01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:37,839
weeks ago

01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:41,359
so i think but

01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:44,400
monthly or so definitely is

01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:47,440
quarterly maybe as a first start

01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,799
is something i think we definitely could

01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,559
propose

01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:53,280
yeah get right maybe you can answer the

01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,440
question in that context why would one

01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,400
download a software package from two

01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,839
weeks ago

01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,240
that contains uh more bugs or in other

01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:04,880
words

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,960
than the current one because you have

01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:10,000
installed it somewhere else i mean

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,599
leap is not only used by people who put

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,760
it on their notebook

01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,720
but it may be used by schools or others

01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,240
and then

01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,799
you you downloaded it for one classroom

01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,520
um you for whatever reason you forgot

01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:25,359
you lost the installation media

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:31,839
and now you want to reproduce or you

01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:31,839
just want to reproduce something

01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,720
and the other aspect obviously is that

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,520
someone needs to qa such images if they

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:44,559
are to be released as like the main

01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:46,559
supported installation medium

01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,400
obviously maintenance updates for like i

01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,640
don't know leaf packages that are not

01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,400
relevant to installation do get some

01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,960
testing um already but

01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,760
if they're actually integrated into the

01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,119
installation

01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,320
image that is something that is

01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:04,319
well that would need to be tested

01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,079
[Music]

01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,920
and that would if you wanted to have a

01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,680
monthly you know rhythm that would mean

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,640
like every four weeks someone would need

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,559
to you know like

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:18,319
you know fiddle with with open qa

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:21,839
test cases for for such builds

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:25,280
but it could mean on the other hand

01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:27,119
every day that leap updates are

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,640
released we could run a test tube as

01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,559
well

01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,400
and then we are not enrolling release

01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:35,200
but we have at least daily

01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,200
fresh installation media that's being

01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,839
tested on open qa

01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,839
that would be even better

01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:54,240
well i think i would go for

01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,079
i would go for a slower slower cadence

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,400
and then see

01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,360
whether there is anything that that

01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,389
you're really missing

01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,389
[Music]

01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,920
definitely be a good start yeah and then

01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,200
you know

01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,319
like i think proposing

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:30,640
say quarterly is not

01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:33,760
doesn't sound excessive and then we see

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,799
when we see whether and how many

01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,799
how many desires that leaves open and

01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,400
but it also allows us to start kicking

01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:43,039
off the process

01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,559
um which is andreas said there is there

01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,480
is definitely going to be some work

01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,520
involved

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,920
maybe start and improve automating and

01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,760
once those things are smoother

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,599
you can go down to two months or one

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,079
month or

01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:05,839
or even less than that possibly if there

01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:05,839
is a need

01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,200
you could of course also version these

01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,599
things like for example the downloads

01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,079
for

01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,760
ubuntu long term support versions this

01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,880
which have dot 1.2 and

01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,680
3 versions i don't know in which

01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,480
image sequence but those still you have

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,480
stability

01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:32,319
and yeah perhaps monthly or whatever

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:34,160
actuality yeah

01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,559
yeah if you version them explicitly then

01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,000
you have you you can refer to them

01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:42,319
good point you see i have this exactly

01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,319
this

01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,640
okay um

01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:58,240
that's good julie noted

01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,640
should we move on to i mean we're kind

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,799
of in

01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,640
in in this area anyway just the

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:07,680
knowledge transfer aspect of it

01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:07,680
you know um yeah sure i i don't

01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,119
it would be interesting um

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,039
to to possibly come up with ideas on how

01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,280
we could could address it

01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,440
um you know we have we have the

01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,400
documentation which obviously

01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,280
is a form of knowledge transfer um best

01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,680
practices

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:32,160
um blogging i think has really been a a

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,799
a very i mean the responses that we got

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,760
on that

01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,319
um was was big most of the people ended

01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,440
up

01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,880
getting their knowledge uh

01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,960
through blogs so that that's helpful if

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,000
any of you are working on something i i

01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,240
would recommend that so

01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,240
sort of one way to go um

01:07:53,359 --> 01:08:00,079
yeah exactly so

01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,960
this idea of knowledge transfer was um i

01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,240
mean

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:08,000
so what is the problem exactly if any

01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,559
so the problem in my view is that um

01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,400
we have many dedicated and skillful

01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,200
people

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,400
but whenever they do something and the

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:19,839
fact that they're doing this

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,640
is not used as a mean for someone else

01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,359
to learn

01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,159
at least learn the basics there is like

01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,440
a waste

01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,159
a waste of of talent and wastes of

01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,199
talent

01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:33,359
um are yeah

01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:35,120
bad because you want the community to

01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,600
strive and you want to attract more

01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,560
people

01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,359
give them opportunity to learn to enjoy

01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,719
them

01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,839
the technical stuff so the the idea

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,480
would be

01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:47,040
okay we improve the docs that's good uh

01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,920
but let's

01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,120
let's make the a step further and make

01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,400
sure that that

01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:57,679
there's no loss of of talent when people

01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,199
do something and that nobody is is

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,359
making use of it

01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:03,759
so we've just had an instance of this

01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:07,199
with um

01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:10,159
saying um uh

01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,719
accepting to to like show the ropes to

01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,400
people

01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,080
uh willing to help with the web

01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,000
platforms but we could we could

01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,239
reiterate that for many different

01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,839
projects not just the web platforms

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,839
that's the context basically

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,279
so perhaps i'm i'm the only one to

01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,560
see that there is a like a wasted

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:48,000
opportunity here maybe

01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:51,520
other people do not share my point here

01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,239
well i think that these i mean i i

01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,280
i understand what you're saying and i

01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:56,719
think

01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,480
you know with with all these different

01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,400
projects that we have and

01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:02,239
these things that we work across with

01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,719
other projects

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,719
it just seems like maybe

01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:12,400
dedicated workshops every now and then

01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,400
might be might be helpful if

01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:17,280
i mean people can learn through blogs

01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,760
they can learn for videos

01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,840
i mean we could simply increase some

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,920
video aspects of it

01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,280
or continue to replay it but you know

01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,320
something like an obs work

01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:30,880
workshop which you know helps

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,480
not only us but it helps out other

01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,120
projects to also

01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,239
further enhance that that knowledge

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,880
transfer

01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:41,360
so that we have it amongst the various

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,360
projects

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,280
open qa which actually they've recently

01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,480
started doing their

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,800
um meetups on

01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,159
fridays that that's a great initiative

01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,760
that they've started

01:10:54,159 --> 01:11:02,800
um would be and i know that also

01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:06,320
lubash uh does something for the next um

01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:08,000
the next um release of leap where he's

01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:11,040
he's talking about features and

01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,080
things like that so that's that's

01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,640
i think we're moving in the right

01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,640
direction there

01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,040
it's really about engagement probably

01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:29,360
so yeah and one idea um

01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,920
i mean because okay workshops uh can do

01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,400
a lot

01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,719
uh it's a sympathetic

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,400
set setting for people to know each

01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,520
other and share knowledge and that's

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,400
very cool

01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,400
but it's um

01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,560
it's fmir it's uh you have just the the

01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,760
workshop and then

01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,199
uh yeah you have to to go in the wild

01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,159
and do stuff yourself

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,920
but another way which is a complimentary

01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:58,239
way it's not meant to be instead

01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,440
to be done instead of workshops would be

01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,239
to have like

01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,520
mentors in the sense that you would have

01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:06,640
maintainers that would

01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,719
accept to take some time to show the

01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,120
ropes to newcomers so that

01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,840
they have an incentive wow i can learn

01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,679
new stuff

01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,440
with that very skillful guy that's so

01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,120
cool and

01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,520
so it's an investment of time at the

01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,159
beginning for the maintainer accepting

01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,960
to play this

01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:25,120
this role but the investment can be paid

01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,120
off

01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,159
in a very very good ratio i think

01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,520
because then he has less work because

01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:36,800
he has contributors that

01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,440
know how to how to work he can rely on

01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,159
them to

01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:43,920
do the job as well so yeah

01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:46,000
could we partially solve this through

01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,000
the

01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:52,000
social media aspects that we have um

01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,360
whether that be a telegram channel

01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,880
dedicated to people that would be

01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,480
willing to mentor

01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,480
or something of that nature

01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,800
of course that could be an entry point

01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,679
but

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,400
it can get messy really quickly to have

01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,280
messages

01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:11,280
fly around i think my idea was more

01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:14,239
connected to the use of

01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,239
pager the

01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:21,120
framework that is the tool so to speak

01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,480
that is used currently by the infra guys

01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,320
um and you can you can create issues and

01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,800
you can create groups and you create you

01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,840
can create tasks and activities on that

01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,000
and on that and it acts like a kind of a

01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:37,280
dashboard but you can see

01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,239
who's doing what with whom so

01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,239
that would be one way

01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:47,679
i i didn't feel that

01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:52,080
we are in a situation where we're a

01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:54,080
product of which is very typical of such

01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,360
product projects which is which have

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,440
grown

01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:02,400
organically and in their own

01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:04,000
way um the underlying thread that i see

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,040
in a lot of the feedback

01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,400
is that we need to bring our resources

01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,520
together

01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,320
um and

01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,960
we there was mention of perhaps uh you

01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,800
know another channeler

01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,159
if anything i think we need less

01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,920
channels

01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:27,360
um so that people can be more focused

01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,360
about where to get stuff

01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,560
i i still

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,080
don't have a handle on the number of

01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,800
channels and

01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:42,320
exactly where to go and get things um

01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:45,199
so i think if anything uh we need

01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,719
less channels and more uh more

01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,640
integration of what we've got

01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,159
because we've got so much stuff but it's

01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,360
in so many

01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:57,040
um different

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,239
uh pockets it makes it very very

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,560
difficult to navigate

01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,840
makes makes it very hard for people to

01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,000
get stuff

01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,360
uh it makes it very hard for people to

01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,480
cooperate

01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:13,280
across the board um

01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:17,840
but i also understand that um um

01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:21,360
somehow this needs to be sort of done

01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:25,120
without it all falling on a few

01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:29,760
you know on on a few people's plates

01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:33,280
um and i don't have solutions

01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:37,199
but i'm just um what i what i what i

01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:40,400
think um we need to do it's really

01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:43,840
make things simpler less channels um

01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:48,719
more teaching more um more this

01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:53,120
mentoring thing um more ability to

01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:56,640
um pass on information all good stuff

01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,679
um but it's it's got to be done in less

01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,000
channels that's um yeah

01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:06,080
you know that that's my feeling i don't

01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,159
know how you guys feel about that

01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,159
you have two peoples in the chat that

01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:12,560
totally agree with you

01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,440
yeah yeah i i i would like to speak up

01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,679
um but

01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,679
i i'm not sure whether i always

01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,800
understand the discussion correctly

01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,040
since

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,400
i am not a power user first of all and

01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,760
i've only been using

01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,360
suse since november i've been using

01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,600
linux as a desktop for

01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,480
10 years though so i do know the ropes a

01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,159
little

01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,560
uh but yeah um i just to tie in

01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:39,440
sometimes uh i just it's not always

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,800
clear where to find the correct info

01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,840
uh on uh on the new on the package and

01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,640
how to configure it

01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,000
uh sometimes it's the dark sometimes

01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,520
sometimes the best practice

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,120
is explained in a blog um and i think we

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,840
can learn something from

01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,600
the art wiki in that regard that you

01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,360
always know it's going to be

01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,080
in the art wiki whether it's going to be

01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:05,840
a lesson like a best practice

01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:08,560
or uh simply a tutorial out of

01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,000
it it's always in the same place and

01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:14,800
that makes every article

01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,920
uh quite different but always useful um

01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:21,199
yeah i i know i haven't been here uh

01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:23,760
in in the uh during those years

01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,880
in which this uh well let's say

01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,960
decentralized

01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,400
uh repository of knowledge has been

01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,280
developed so i don't know the arguments

01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,199
why things are

01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,560
in the way they are now so that's why

01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:36,159
i'm a bit hesitant

01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:45,840
but this is my two cents as a relatively

01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:45,840
new user

01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,440
yeah to agree with you i mean uh the

01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,159
archwiki is

01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,120
uh it's it's a bad example because it's

01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:56,640
an extremely

01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:59,440
well structured and well maintained uh

01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,840
wiki and i think this is the reference

01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,960
uh

01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:05,520
for me in many points as well true um

01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,880
and regarding the channel um i

01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,880
personally

01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,880
don't get me wrong it's just my personal

01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,199
way of working

01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,560
i i feel is a little bit confusing and

01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:20,239
way too much as well

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:23,679
i prefer to work really the old style

01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:27,040
mailing listing way because that

01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,960
gives me the opportunity to work on them

01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,520
at a time that i prefer

01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,800
if if you're in a chat or somewhere the

01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,440
information

01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,159
is a little bit more transient it comes

01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,040
in

01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:39,760
very quickly and you have 10 topics

01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,480
parents

01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,320
being discussed and it's difficult to

01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,840
follow up which topic

01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,840
which which answer belongs to which

01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,800
topic and so on

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,280
so i see this more under a social aspect

01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,880
that

01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,120
people chat with each other but i

01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,159
wouldn't really consider this as a

01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,960
source of information probably as a

01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:02,640
source for

01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:06,320
for quick help of course but

01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,320
i guess here every user is different as

01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,840
well

01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,679
and it's probably worth noting that we

01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,400
deployed

01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,440
mailman and and the other tools not only

01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,640
because

01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:29,679
of the changes that souza

01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,679
was doing with

01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:38,960
dmarc but also because

01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:42,800
this is kind of a little bit better of a

01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:45,280
mailing software than than others

01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,400
for reasons that it's a little bit

01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,520
easier to use

01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:53,120
by total noobs and

01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:56,960
that's valuable when when you want to

01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:00,640
encourage people to use mailing lists

01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,760
which isn't easy but

01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:06,960
you don't have to use email you you can

01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,719
use uh our mailing list entirely out of

01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:12,480
your browser

01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:16,239
and that's a great thing if you

01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,239
if you are reduced to this way of

01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,840
collaborating

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,360
yeah that was definitely uh an

01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,239
improvement straziak and

01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,040
the new male archive is way better than

01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,840
the old one

01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,840
it was really a step forward

01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840
um

01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:58,480
should we shift maybe to the promotion

01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:58,480
aspect um if well

01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,679
if you go to slide 16 let me throw that

01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,679
lincoln

01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,920
in the chat just so that people that are

01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,719
just coming in will

01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,040
be able to see it but if you go to slide

01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:26,239
16 you should see

01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,239
there is um

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,239
is it sort of a breakdown we had

01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,600
comments and

01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:36,719
um from those comments i was able to

01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,400
kind of put together what what were the

01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,280
motivations like how how did people

01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,480
learn about

01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:45,360
about um

01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:47,120
using open source even you know um linux

01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,239
in general or

01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:53,679
um and what you ended up with was

01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:55,600
uh you had the youtube videos you had

01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,960
blogs you had other

01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,280
and then this others is is what slide 16

01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,960
is

01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,560
slide 15 you can see all the kind of

01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,840
like how people learned

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:09,040
how people found out about it um

01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,760
and this goes into the area where we

01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,280
want to

01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,320
talk a bit about promotion um

01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,000
some of the workplace some of the

01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,440
universities some of the conferences the

01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,679
ones that the conferences were a bit of

01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,280
a

01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:25,360
surprise to me but um for some of them

01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:29,760
but anyway word of mouth tended

01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:34,480
to be biggest the biggest

01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:37,520
motivator and then um

01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:39,840
podcasts were in their discord

01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,840
um

01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,880
obs social media was was also there in

01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:48,639
magazines

01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:51,040
so this is these are the

01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:54,080
really good one though it was the music

01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,080
videos from souza

01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,679
that was that was quite interesting um

01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:00,080
but

01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,239
anyway going into that um you know what

01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:05,280
what ideas can we come up with

01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:08,400
on perhaps increasing sort of

01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,840
either one right word of mouth um or

01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:15,360
uh just just giving people to

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:18,560
to shift toward uh

01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,560
using linux and using

01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,600
the distributions we have to offer

01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:31,679
yeah do you want to get that adrian

01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,199
and expand on it um i mean just my two

01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,840
cents

01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:36,560
but it seems that people are not aware i

01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,159
mean people

01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,800
outside of the community and perhaps

01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:44,560
also within are not fully aware of

01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,960
um the the value proposition that we

01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,000
we put on the table and in particular

01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,800
tumblrweed i think

01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,360
is sometimes misdescribed or

01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:57,120
misconceived of by people it's sometimes

01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:00,400
seen as a rolling uh distribution

01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,400
therefore unstable while the

01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,480
complete opposite is true it's probably

01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,760
the most i mean to me in my experience

01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:11,280
just one person but it's one of the most

01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:14,080
stable and um

01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:17,840
leading release that exists in the in

01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,840
the linux world

01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,840
sorry trim to interrupt you ivo

01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:32,080
that's no problem thank you so yeah no

01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,960
no no

01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,440
so um yeah perhaps we could put emphasis

01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,239
on

01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:40,080
on the particular value proposition of

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:43,600
tumblrweed as something which is

01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:47,040
both stable and cutting edge

01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,080
that's something our like rivals so to

01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,480
speak

01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,080
uh cannot really compete with certainly

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,199
not ubuntu

01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:57,440
and fedora has a different model

01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,639
the kernel is bleeding edge but not

01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,239
really the rest

01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,800
so it's something it's something that

01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:05,600
really goes in the essence of

01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,800
of open source i would say to to have

01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,920
this tumbleweed

01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,679
distribution and we could perhaps make

01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,199
sure everyone is on the same page about

01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,120
that

01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,719
it's not to say that leap is not

01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,159
important it's just that leap is more

01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,239
classical so

01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,360
perhaps we have less misconceptions

01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,679
about leap from

01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,679
people

01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,480
so that this kind of goes i don't think

01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,440
this is uh

01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,400
sorry go ahead i don't think this is a

01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,880
discussion about

01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,639
tumbleweed or leap it's really about

01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,239
opensuse

01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:43,199
um doug i thought you did

01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:44,400
um that that magazine where we got

01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:47,199
published in

01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,159
uh the linux magazine i thought it was

01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:51,760
phenomenal

01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:53,280
um and uh there's never been a person

01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,719
i've given it to

01:25:53,280 --> 01:26:00,400
who hasn't come back to me and said wow

01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:02,960
i didn't know you know uh you can do all

01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,480
of this and it's that straightforward

01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,400
and that doesn't matter whether they're

01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:09,840
power users or

01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:14,159
uh geeks or just

01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:16,159
uh completely new to uh linux

01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:17,840
um the only thing that's really hard

01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:21,040
about that approach

01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:23,360
is um

01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,480
it's it's it's printed it's printed

01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,520
paper

01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,520
somehow if we can electronify that i

01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,840
think we could do well in terms of

01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:35,760
getting our message out there

01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,080
um uh adrian i i fully understand what

01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,600
you're

01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:42,159
saying um about

01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,400
tumbleweed yeah it's great it's lovely

01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:48,719
it's sexy it's stable

01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:50,960
but i i don't think that's the bigger

01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:55,520
picture i think it's really

01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:59,360
putting the open susa name out there um

01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:03,360
and getting people to see it as

01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:06,000
in in the same light as they do ubuntu

01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,960
i would say eight out of ten people that

01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,679
i meet

01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:14,880
um if you speak to them about linux

01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:16,840
they all know ubuntu they all know red

01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,679
hat

01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:23,600
um and

01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:26,719
to a lesser extent susa fedora or

01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,040
that sort of thing but opensuse

01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,760
really doesn't come into it and i i

01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,800
think

01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:36,800
what we're trying to discuss here is how

01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:41,360
we can make ourselves more visible

01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:42,400
um i would say that depending on whom

01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,800
you're looking at

01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,639
some people will even equate ubuntu to

01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,560
linux and just see android as an

01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:51,360
alternative and you know no red hat no

01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,360
zuza at all

01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:02,560
well i i don't know the answer

01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:06,000
i don't know the answer but i do know uh

01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,120
doug who wrote that that that that thing

01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,960
on um

01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,320
in the magazine are you aware do you do

01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,080
you know the magazine i'm talking about

01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,239
you sent me a whole ton of them

01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,679
yeah yeah so so a little background on

01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:18,320
the magazine that's

01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,320
a partnership that we have well we we

01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,840
pay linux magazine

01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:23,840
um is

01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:29,840
it sort of subsidizes their production

01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,440
of it we provide some of the content we

01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,080
when we started it off i think the first

01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:37,520
issue was um

01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:38,080
leap 42.3 i think was the first time we

01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,520
did

01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,560
that maybe it was 2 42.2 but anyway

01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,480
besides that

01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,880
we got the initial content then every

01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:48,800
year it's sort of like refreshing

01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,280
the content i still have a bunch of

01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,480
magazines for 15.2

01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,880
got them just because we didn't

01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,800
necessarily know um where we would be at

01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:00,080
with the current epidemic

01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,520
but um it's

01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:06,800
it's been i mean we we have that we just

01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,920
you know there's a sales side to it that

01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,840
we

01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,840
can't necessarily like

01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,800
give get give it on i mean there is an

01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,840
electron

01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,719
trying to copy but then it's like people

01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,159
pay for that

01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:27,679
through linux magazine and we get the

01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:30,560
printed versions to like give out at

01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,440
conferences uh obviously sentence and to

01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,600
people that want to

01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,080
promote it drop it off at universities

01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,159
things like that

01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,440
it is helpful that you can see it in the

01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:43,040
statistics as well

01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:45,440
in the end the end of your

01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,440
survey

01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:54,800
mauricio you're very quiet i know you've

01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:56,320
seen the magazine what do you reckon to

01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,280
it do you reckon that would be a great

01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:01,199
way to get people into it or

01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,880
because a lot of the documentation stuff

01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:04,000
we've been talking about i think it's

01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,760
it's

01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,719
it's right here it's it's right here

01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:13,760
it's all in the magazine

01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:15,360
all of the stuff yes but i understand

01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,960
also the concerns that that just

01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,199
explained i mean if there are people

01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,199
that paid for it obviously it wouldn't

01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:23,679
be fair to

01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:24,320
sort of like distribute it for free but

01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,280
i think

01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:29,520
what uh the approach that fedora took if

01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,440
we want to continue the discussion on

01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:34,239
documentation like they basically

01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,520
converted i if i'm not wrong they're

01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:37,520
vicky and they

01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,080
turn it into real documentation so if

01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,679
you go on on anything

01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,679
i don't have the website right now but i

01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,120
can i can type it later but

01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,800
if you look at what of the world they

01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,560
did it's

01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,480
pretty amazing and it looks like a

01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,920
really a lot of work

01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,920
that needs to be put into sort of

01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,920
replicated and

01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,520
i know that the documentation team is

01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,920
working quite hard on

01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,440
doing doing something i don't know

01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:02,400
exactly whether it's similar or not but

01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,639
i know that

01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:07,040
they have a lot of meetings regularly to

01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:09,679
improve the documentation that we have

01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,480
i'm not sure if there are people from

01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,920
the team

01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,920
i was quickly looking but

01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,800
i don't know if i mean print magazine

01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,280
probably not

01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,320
but in order to actually get something

01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,920
good

01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,360
out in terms of pr we probably need to

01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,679
work internally first

01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,480
to improve the technical documentation

01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:30,960
that we

01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:31,760
that we have available for free and then

01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,159
maybe we can

01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,760
uh we can start talking about that but

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:38,639
i'm not even sure that that's

01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,960
uh that's their best approach to to

01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,000
spread the word of open source around as

01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:46,560
well

01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:48,159
i think probably

01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,480
it's something that has been happening a

01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:53,199
little bit more lately is to have

01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,960
uh podcasters uh feature like talking

01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,239
about the distributions in open source

01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:00,239
and

01:31:56,239 --> 01:32:03,360
it is a bit unfortunate that uh recently

01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:03,760
people that tried tumbleweed who now

01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:06,719
have

01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,920
slightly popular podcasts they were they

01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,320
were not particularly

01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,440
giving good feedbacks about it uh

01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,679
although they were

01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,960
quite fair i think you know on a lot of

01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,480
the points

01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,719
and definitely things that need to be

01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,840
taken into consideration to improve

01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,840
but overall i mean even if uh

01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,280
even if the the feedback was were not

01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,400
positive the fact that people are

01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:30,000
talking about it

01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,600
that's what we want right and we need to

01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,600
when these kind of things happen instead

01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,719
of like bashing them we should probably

01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,560
encourage more of this kind of

01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,080
let's say testing if you if you want to

01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,760
call it all reviews

01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:46,000
of what we do at least this is what i

01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,000
think

01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,440
yeah so just quick words on the first

01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,719
part

01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:59,360
of your um of your reply so

01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:01,199
yes uh converting the wiki into a real

01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,760
documentation is exactly what

01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:04,719
um the people from the docs are trying

01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:09,600
to do so that's

01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:12,639
uh that's a win already

01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,080
okay good i wasn't sure i know they've

01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,600
been working on it but i haven't

01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,120
followed lately the development so i

01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,560
wasn't sure exactly

01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:22,480
whether that was the direction that they

01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:24,880
were taking um

01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:27,040
i see two things here one is the

01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,400
documentation

01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:33,350
and the other one is getting

01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,960
uh getting the word out there as it were

01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:38,220
[Music]

01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:40,159
make a which is a marketing thing um

01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:42,320
[Music]

01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,440
i think the what what i was trying to

01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:46,560
say is

01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:50,639
the on the documentation side

01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:52,560
um a lot of the work that we have to do

01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,920
is obviously already there it's just a

01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,600
matter of collating it

01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:01,840
and what i was proposing is if we can

01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:05,120
use the material inside that magazine

01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:06,639
as a quick start documentation and then

01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,520
put it online

01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:12,880
i think that would be really brilliant

01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:15,120
and it would be a quick win

01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,040
with that under our belt with that under

01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:20,800
our belt we could then go out

01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:23,440
and mark it with that and say

01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,840
hey look at this look at how easy it is

01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:28,560
look at how great it is

01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,080
just for context may i ask you so this

01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,159
this magazines

01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,719
gives you like a quick start to the open

01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:37,840
source world something like that

01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:41,040
pretty much it comes with um

01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,280
an open source of 15.2 dvd

01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:44,320
and it goes right through from the

01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,679
newbie

01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:49,679
all the way to touching on docker

01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,040
in fact i was just flicking through it

01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,679
whilst um

01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:55,199
uh maurizio was talking there and it

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,239
literally it goes through the whole

01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:59,920
thing

01:34:56,239 --> 01:35:00,960
from uh for for different for different

01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,880
types of people

01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,239
for people who want to use this for

01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,239
office work

01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,920
uh for people who want to use it for a

01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:11,040
bit of um you know

01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,000
photographic work um

01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,760
and it it's just a page or two quick

01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,719
start

01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,840
and it's written in a way in which even

01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,520
if you came

01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:25,199
to it with with no linux experience

01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:28,320
whatsoever you could just chuck this

01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:31,520
disk into your computer and

01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:33,119
uh work with this

01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,880
it's it's pretty easy it's pretty

01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:37,440
straightforward it's it's written

01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,840
in it's written in a very simple

01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:43,280
language that's easy to follow

01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:47,679
um i

01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:48,080
i gave it to uh some people who have

01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:52,560
been

01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:52,560
completely windows people who

01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:59,840
um looked at it and thought wow

01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:59,840
i didn't know it was this easy

01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:05,040
nice one thing to add is that the entire

01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,440
magazine is

01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:09,119
focused on opensuse but then it goes

01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,280
through

01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:12,639
of obviously software that is not uh

01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,880
let's say necessarily only

01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,560
available in open source for example if

01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,080
i remember correctly they show you how

01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,880
to use like some basics of

01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,520
 i think libreoffice as well and

01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,119
then yeah

01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,719
other things so it's uh it's really like

01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:27,360
an introduction to linux

01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,000
for people that never use linux before

01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,800
and

01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,840
it is a it is a pretty pretty amazing uh

01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,840
piece of work actually

01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:41,760
it's cool the the great thing about

01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:44,960
it is um it it

01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,440
it's all it's all based around opensuse

01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,480
so

01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:51,280
um you know it's um

01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:53,280
it it's it's a it's it's dead easy for

01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,600
us to use and adapt

01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,960
that i don't really know what the

01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,719
licensing or the

01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,800
you know the copyright issues and stuff

01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:04,400
like that would be

01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,400
perhaps you can chime in on that

01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:09,119
i can talk to brah he's the owner of the

01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:13,199
linux magazine i can talk to him

01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:13,199
and and see what um

01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,320
what can be done um

01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,239
doug you mentioned that we are paying

01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:26,960
the linux magazine

01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:29,199
for um including a dvd or making a

01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:33,119
special edition out of it

01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:35,760
yeah so so um it's more of a subsidized

01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:37,119
thing so what happens is

01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,719
when you end up with some of these

01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,560
magazines and that's obviously a

01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,119
struggling thing as it is in this day

01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,840
and age

01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:46,719
but um for them to actually come up with

01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,960
these special

01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:54,320
versions they need some sort of initial

01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:57,440
funds that will allow them to

01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:59,920
make it worthy or make it worthwhile for

01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:02,960
them to produce it

01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:06,480
and so usually

01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:09,520
um i think it was about 9 000

01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,800
euro is what we've spent per year

01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:17,199
over the past few years

01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:20,560
um and then refreshing that content

01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:24,000
is done through um

01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,719
some people did well actually all the

01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,760
names are there

01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:30,719
so you can see who who wrote stuff there

01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,560
and then we update it um but that is

01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,639
that's the

01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,280
that's what we've done in the past and

01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,280
it's uh

01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,520
pretty inexpensive when you think about

01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:45,360
how many magazines we get out of it

01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:48,400
um and yeah so that that's

01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:51,440
i i'll talk to brian um

01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:52,639
and see what we could look at doing with

01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:56,080
that

01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:59,199
um and he'll

01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,199
you know an idea comes to my mind um the

01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:03,280
ct magazine is

01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:06,000
probably the most important and largest

01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:09,840
i.t magazine in europe

01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:13,920
and they are completely ubuntu minded

01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:17,520
um i mean we just had a chat

01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:20,800
or a tweet with those limus who was the

01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,920
former linux editor of of the ct

01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,080
magazine

01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,600
and he thought yeah that was a decision

01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,600
that was made

01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:31,600
above his income level um

01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:32,639
and maybe he didn't fought hard enough

01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,520
or something like that

01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,000
but what do you think if we contact them

01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,520
and say

01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,080
guys what we have leave 15.3

01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,119
in the doorstep that is basically

01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,119
marrying

01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:46,560
the sleep products with the leap

01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:52,080
products

01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:55,520
and we want you to include a dvd of that

01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:58,880
in a certain issue of the ct magazine

01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:02,000
and maybe have two or three articles

01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:02,400
about the advantages and something like

01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,080
that

01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:08,960
and we provide you the dvds and

01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,960
maybe also the articles and then we need

01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,719
to discuss whether we need some

01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,760
additional money in terms of an

01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:19,600
advertorial or something like that

01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,600
would that be something that's feasible

01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:26,800
i'll um with vera and um

01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,159
you know there's there's some areas we

01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:35,040
can leverage there i think

01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:38,719
for sure shooting magazine

01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:39,040
um i don't know what the the market in

01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,639
in

01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,960
asia for example is i mean our user base

01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,880
is

01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,880
more or less coming from europe and

01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,159
coming from north america and i see a

01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,280
big potential in

01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:52,480
in asia and maybe also australia as

01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:55,600
there is

01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:58,159
it's not too much not too

01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,520
big user base at the moment um we know

01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:01,280
indonesia is a

01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,639
is a big community and they're very

01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:07,360
active as well

01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,239
over here in hong kong uh the open

01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:12,080
source

01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:15,360
association they are pretty much all uh

01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:18,159
fanboys and i think i mean uh to be

01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,800
honest yes there is a recent me here in

01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:21,920
hong kong

01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,840
and there are some other people but

01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,159
yeah it's most of the most of the time

01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,159
it's always

01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:37,520
it's supported um i have

01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,880
i i where in the in the markets where i

01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,239
work

01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:46,080
um in the asian markets

01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:49,840
uh tend to be hong kong singapore

01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:54,880
uh malaysia philippines and

01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:57,520
um india um

01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:59,360
with the exception of india and even

01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,560
there i found it very hard it's

01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,560
we're almost unknown

01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,159
i i believe we have better

01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:09,520
representation in taiwan and

01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:14,239
and mainland china but

01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:16,239
i i i i couldn't comment because i i'm

01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:17,920
not actively involved in those

01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:19,840
in those areas in those in those

01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:24,400
geographic locations

01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:26,719
i mean i actually have a um

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,800
i mean from from our piewick instance i

01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:33,760
can i can see

01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,760
the various uh locations that

01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:39,199
people at least like go to

01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,199
software.opensouza.org or go to

01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,239
uh search is actually a better one

01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:45,760
because

01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:47,440
at least with search um

01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,360
you know that's someone opening up a

01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,239
browser that's actually running opensuse

01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,040
so

01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:54,880
um that's that's quite nice but it is

01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:58,480
kind of spread out

01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:02,400
um and

01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:04,400
i could just come up with a quick uh

01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,080
stat for y'all we probably should ask

01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,560
people like you know where did they

01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:09,360
learn

01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,639
about opensuse versus where did they

01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,000
learn about their first length

01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,520
distribution

01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,280
because then we would you know what are

01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,719
like the main sources and we could try

01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,920
to address them

01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:22,400
ours were um our our end of year results

01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,159
actually did specifically ask about um

01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:26,000
open cities that they were

01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:27,520
adrian do you want to go into this

01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
because you're you're probably a bit

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,119
more

01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,159
um knowledgeable on on

01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:37,679
how to explain this yes

01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:38,159
i just missed uh the your sentence

01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,679
course

01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:44,880
uh about the documentation no no um

01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:48,560
andreas was asking about the um

01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:51,360
the question regarding uh

01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,000
using opensuse versus like what was your

01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,320
first linux

01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,320
distribution type of thing and we we had

01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:59,360
the we had those answers

01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:02,560
specifically as in you know

01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,480
what did you use before you yeah yeah so

01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,719
exactly so in a nutshell we are a

01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,480
population of switchers we have many

01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,600
people that have been using

01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:14,480
different linux systems

01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:16,400
unique space system technically but

01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,760
mostly linux i would guess

01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,280
and also windows people so these are the

01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,400
guys who

01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,920
that compose the community um and and

01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,199
that's something we can take advantage

01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,800
of because

01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:34,560
we can press oppose a certain amount of

01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:39,119
knowledge um yeah

01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,119
so in a nutshell that's that's it

01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:46,000
but i mean how the um how it was

01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,040
how they were how the questions were

01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,239
phrased

01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:53,360
in a sense was very specific

01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:57,199
as we were trying to figure out if

01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:59,040
people were still using systems um

01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,840
if they completely like needed to switch

01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:03,280
over to opensuse

01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,000
um you know things things of that nature

01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:07,679
was

01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:10,639
it was the question was there andreas

01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:12,320
it was just it was just not in the slide

01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:16,239
set then because i'm looking at like

01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:19,600
slide 15 and 16.

01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:23,040
yeah this promotion motivators

01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:24,320
yeah i mean like distro watch or linux

01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,000
magazine that

01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,000
if that really means like the linux

01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,040
magazine those are like the most

01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,040
concrete ones maybe of external sources

01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,560
um whereas you know like if it just says

01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:37,920
you know school or

01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:39,199
university um or conference you know

01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,520
then that is a bit

01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:44,159
more abstract yeah so the the others

01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,480
were comments so if you go to 15 you'll

01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:48,960
see

01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:52,719
like the breakdown and that like

01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:56,080
other that's on slide 15

01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:59,600
is what's captured in slide 16

01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:01,760
basic for ones that did respond

01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,040
um and i kind of like went through it

01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,199
and this is rather

01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:06,560
general but like i tried to categorize

01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:09,280
them the best i could

01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,920
so that's what you end up having um with

01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,280
that

01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:16,400
specific question

01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,560
so this is anecdotal um but

01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,400
i was one of the people who said other

01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:23,600
and then word of mouth

01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:25,840
but i actually came through uh reddit

01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,880
on opensuse because i'm subscribed to

01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:31,679
the r

01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,679
linux subreddit and

01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,480
i think it was mike brown he's quite

01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:39,520
active there and he uh was quite

01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,239
successful explaining the qualities of

01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:43,199
tumbleweed

01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,840
uh in comparison to stable distros as

01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:47,119
well as

01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:49,600
other rolling distros um

01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:50,239
and so yeah i just want to say that um

01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:52,400
if

01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:54,400
we are looking for what that word of

01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:58,400
mouth uh

01:46:54,400 --> 01:47:01,040
platform might be or how we can maybe

01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:02,000
engage with other users who would be

01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,719
willing to use

01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,600
opensuse um i think reddit is a really

01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:11,440
good platform that we could

01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:16,320
try and engage with with good blog posts

01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:20,800
and well whatever i guess

01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:23,760
yeah i mean yeah i mean apart from from

01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,280
having a a nice user experience uh the

01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,080
things we can do is either

01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,440
yeah interact with people on social

01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,920
media and and

01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:33,600
like persistent platforms such as reddit

01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,440
and forums etc

01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,880
but another thing is also to get

01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:39,920
featured in

01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:43,840
in live events so in podcasts

01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:46,639
in conferences um whenever someone

01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:48,639
whenever a famous youtuber makes a video

01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:51,119
get featured in the video something

01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,400
and that that that takes a lot of

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:55,840
commitment

01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:57,760
um to discover that these things are

01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,639
going to happen to get in touch

01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:02,719
with the influencers and to get featured

01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:05,440
so it's a lot of involvement and

01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,480
i'm not quite sure how we could achieve

01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:10,719
that but it's

01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:14,800
it would probably be extremely uh

01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,800
powerful to reach out to people

01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:19,440
i think those people could be reached

01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:22,560
with a

01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:25,040
big launch event um if we

01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,239
i i'm not sure the the new leap release

01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,800
is coming up if we

01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:30,239
they they need content right so if we

01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,679
make content for them

01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:37,199
then perhaps they will uh

01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:37,199
yeah drop our name so to speak

01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,800
i think not just uh leap releases but

01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:43,520
also like

01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,239
uh desktop releases like for example

01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,280
when is there

01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:48,320
when there is a release of kde i know

01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,560
it's not really

01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,760
related to us but for example opensuse

01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,159
is not

01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,040
famous for being a kde uh distribution

01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:58,080
so

01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,199
uh we should perhaps uh try to convince

01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,679
them to

01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:03,520
to test the new features of kde using

01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:06,080
opensuse for example

01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,679
instead of using kde neon or anything

01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:11,440
else yeah

01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:13,520
do we do we actually have anywhere

01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:15,360
i don't think i've seen it something

01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,679
like a reviewer's guide

01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:20,080
so what i mean by that for example in

01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:23,040
your case there's a new version of kde

01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,840
where is a new version of flip like one

01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:26,840
page

01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,159
if you print it like a one-page document

01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,199
that

01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:33,040
anyone can just access like we could

01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:36,159
push it out to journalists

01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,960
they talk to the three five top points

01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:41,040
and tell makes it easy for them to get

01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,920
to screenshots makes it easy for them to

01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:46,560
give it a try if they want

01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,880
you're talking about prescott

01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:52,639
additionally we probably should

01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,639
invest in getting a

01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:59,119
press kit so we have

01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,400
uh we have our logos and and other

01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:05,040
material

01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:05,040
uh easily accessible for media

01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:10,719
i think it's probably similar to press

01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,520
kit but what do you mean by press kit

01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:16,400
so i'm saying i'm only saying this

01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:18,800
should be additional to to your point

01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,679
because we don't have an easily

01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,560
accessible

01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,239
way to get our logos and and under other

01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:27,040
branding material that that

01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:29,679
would make it easier for journalists to

01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:32,560
talk about operations

01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:34,800
so so i'll just hop in here real quick

01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:37,280
so every release i do a press kit

01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,639
and that includes the snap the

01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,480
screenshots

01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,639
that include sending them the gold

01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:45,520
master um

01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,840
so that they get a chance to to check it

01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,159
out

01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,599
and and write their comments about it i

01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:53,360
give

01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:54,800
images to them logos um

01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,760
that we're kind of go with with that

01:50:54,800 --> 01:51:01,440
release it's always helpful to have

01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:04,800
each um release having some sort of uh

01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:05,840
some sort of image as you you probably

01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,440
noticed

01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:12,800
this one with 15 2 was containers

01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:15,679
the one before that was part of uh

01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,760
i think you ended up doing that one with

01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:21,679
leap 15 it was the green

01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:24,719
with the um with some sort of

01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:26,400
the patterns the patterns yeah yeah

01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:28,960
so those things do exist we don't have

01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:33,280
anything specific like

01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:34,000
on well i do put it on the wiki to

01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:37,119
download but

01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,400
like and i send it out to

01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:43,599
a list of media uh that i have

01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:45,520
and also asks for um

01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:48,400
help in getting that information out

01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:51,520
from people that do susan marketing

01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:56,239
um but it is uh

01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,239
sometimes it's hit or miss um

01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,840
it really really depends i mean that's

01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,760
great actually

01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,920
maybe we can help together make make

01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,920
this even more

01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:11,360
um more broadly known

01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:14,159
[Music]

01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:15,280
i think i'd be happy to tweet about it

01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:19,199
if it just wasn't

01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:22,239
there which is probably my fault

01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:24,159
um but i would be happy to tweet about

01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,639
it and i'm sure others and we can push

01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:28,080
it out

01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:30,080
even even in a

01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:32,159
more public setting so not directly

01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:34,000
necessary in addition to

01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:37,119
what you do with it with the journalists

01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,119
already yeah

01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:42,000
i feel we somehow got sidetracked from

01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,920
the previous question

01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,560
into talking about you know how can we

01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,400
promote new leap releases to the press

01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,760
um if we're talking about just you know

01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,000
other people wanting to do

01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:54,159
vlogs podcasts and you know other forms

01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,840
of things i think well there's two kinds

01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:57,679
of people so there's the one

01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,920
that are basically really bought into a

01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,080
linux distribution and are you know like

01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,840
we'll use open zoos and then try to do

01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:05,599
something based on opensuse because

01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,199
that's what they're doing anyway

01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,800
whereas then there's the other people

01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,239
that will be driven by what they

01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,840
actually want to do which is kind of

01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:14,080
circling back to

01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,760
what i was you know like mentioning in

01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:17,280
the chat early on so

01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,040
um you know if someone really wants to

01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:22,480
do a cool let's say

01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,760
ai image recognition demo and they go to

01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:26,560
you know find a

01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,080
code that does that on github and you

01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,159
then only encounter

01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:32,239
um you know instructions that tell you

01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:33,280
to do apt install something then they

01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:35,520
are more likely

01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,920
to actually blog about that or you know

01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:39,360
talk about that with the ubuntu system

01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:41,280
rather than going through all the

01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,239
difficulty of trying to make the same

01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,159
actually run

01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,960
on opensuse simply because it's way

01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,960
easier for them

01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:52,320
i think you've got a very very good

01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:55,199
point there i

01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:57,760
listened to a podcast which i just ended

01:53:55,199 --> 01:54:01,920
up giving up on because

01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:05,280
um the only thing they had to say about

01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:08,880
susa that stuck in my mind was

01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:12,400
bitching about how slow zipper was by

01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,920
comparison to apt and i thought well

01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:16,159
if you really don't understand the

01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:21,199
product you you you you

01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:23,360
um it's it it was almost as though

01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:25,440
they'd made up their mind before they'd

01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:28,719
done their podcast

01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:30,400
um so you you have to be very careful

01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:33,119
about that sort of thing and

01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,320
you've hit the nail on the head if it's

01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:36,239
if they have

01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,239
if the guys who do these things have to

01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:41,920
learn something new

01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:43,280
and have to understand something um

01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,280
they're not going to put their heart and

01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,880
soul on it they're they're just going to

01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,920
um

01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,239
um you know get something out the door

01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,440
and

01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:56,560
and and if it's easier to do it with

01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:58,000
as you say ubuntu because they're um

01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,920
they're familiar with that that's what

01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,440
they're going to do so we'll have to

01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:03,119
work around that

01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,880
uh not necessarily because they're

01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:06,639
familiar with that simply because you

01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,080
know like that's what you know when you

01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:09,520
um you know that's like the most

01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,320
dominant thing that you actually find

01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,320
instructions for

01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,080
well so even though you're not

01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:17,599
necessarily bought into ubuntu you know

01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:19,119
they might actually then because of

01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:20,960
something like that you know like

01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:24,080
download a ubuntu image to run that

01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,400
thing in that was what i was thinking

01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:26,400
right

01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:30,840
i i honestly feel we need to find areas

01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:35,040
where we

01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:38,159
excel and then try and

01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:40,400
get people to talk about that

01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,599
and i honestly feel that where we excel

01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:45,040
is um

01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:47,280
it's a very balanced distribution

01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:48,400
we cater for just about everybody as

01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:51,599
opposed to

01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:54,719
just the geeks or the school kids or the

01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,480
um yeah

01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:01,119
that's that's what i that's what i tend

01:55:56,480 --> 01:56:05,280
to think we do very well

01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:05,280
um for podcast

01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:13,520
i collaborate with atla pinter

01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:17,040
to a strange way to make a

01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:20,800
podcast we would like to interview

01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:25,119
uh um special

01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:28,800
users we of open souza

01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:33,119
why especially users because he's a

01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:36,480
masters of an argument for example

01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:39,520
a graphic designer and uses pesos

01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:42,960
and explain why you

01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:45,679
are using opensuse or we

01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,679
talk about

01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:56,639
marketing we speak

01:56:52,880 --> 01:57:01,679
with the best marketer

01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:01,679
in opensuse why you are

01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:10,719
promoting opensuse we have this idea to

01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:13,760
make a podcast is not

01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:16,800
very technical but is

01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:20,239
for our opinion the way to explain

01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:25,679
because um we are

01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:39,840
the best in some um

01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:39,840
special way to work with opensuse

01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:47,040
at least when if i can say i'm worried

01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,000
about this

01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:51,040
i mean whatever effort we're going to

01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,840
put into this

01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:54,800
into improving marketing and promotion

01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,679
um

01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,599
will probably it will have to be

01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,920
sustained we cannot just

01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:02,960
marketing i'm not marketing people

01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,040
person but

01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:06,159
one of the few things i know about this

01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:09,119
you cannot just

01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:10,639
do a one sprint a one-shot thing and

01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:11,679
then hope that everything is fixed you

01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:14,800
have to maintain that

01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:17,520
to recall yourself so to speak to

01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:20,880
everyone's mind etc so it's a long

01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:23,040
it's a long long term effort

01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:26,159
and it's not possible to do that unless

01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:29,920
you have dedicated teams

01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:33,679
okay we would like to make a

01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:37,440
conversation one to one presenter

01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:40,560
and a showman

01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:44,000
maybe atla printer and the

01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:47,280
users which we would like to interview

01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,480
in a single podcast

01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:53,520
and for example we would like to

01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:58,560
uh interview uh the

01:58:53,520 --> 01:59:00,639
founder of g g cosdo repository because

01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,679
he's a repository for musician

01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:07,679
or we would like to talk about

01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:10,480
important users that use for security

01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:10,480
of asusa

01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:17,920
we would like to talk about

01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:23,040
depths of open susan

01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:23,040
is the informal way to

01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,960
show to other users

01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:30,960
what is open source up for

01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:45,679
if you see a professionalist

01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:49,480
that use opensuse i think wow

01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:52,719
i can use opensuse because he's a

01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:55,199
professional where would that be

01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:55,199
published

01:59:55,599 --> 02:00:02,080
we don't know where we think

01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:05,119
uh surely youtube

02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:09,280
but i don't know if we have the

02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:12,719
possibility to make this video inside

02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:18,159
official open sousa

02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:21,070
channel but i have all the technology to

02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:22,480
interview people with the

02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:26,400
[Music]

02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:29,760
webcam or webcam desktop sharing

02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,760
and i can make

02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:37,440
the registration

02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:40,800
recording in at distance

02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:44,239
because i use a technology called

02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:48,080
obs ninja and i

02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:51,199
share a few links and the

02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:54,639
users share me webcam

02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:58,800
and desktop for me

02:00:54,639 --> 02:01:01,440
is not difficult to make this way to

02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,440
recording

02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,679

i have to get going but um

02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:20,320
i don't want to be the one who ends this

02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:21,040
if if anyone wants if everyone wants to

and help out we'll have it next

02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,080
we'll have another section next week

02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:37,760
where we'll

02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:39,520
get into um sort of tools dra

02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:41,280
driving switchers which we kind of

02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,280
briefly talked about as well

02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:44,840
expanding global users increasing

02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:49,040
diversity

02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:51,119
um and some of the younger generation as

02:02:49,040 --> 02:03:00,560
well

02:02:51,119 --> 02:03:04,719
so it'll be the same channel

02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:07,440
sound sounds very nice um i mean

02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:09,119
are they i mean so most people are calm

02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:11,119
so i don't know but

02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:12,159
perhaps some people would like to stay

02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:14,080
to talk

02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:17,119
a bit more informal informally about

02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:19,760
stuff that we can do

02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:22,400
if not uh yeah there are always the

02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:22,400
platforms

02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,239
before we meet next week is there some

02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:31,360
way we can try and

02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:35,440
get the message out about this

02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:37,440
i was um quite surprised that there

02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:40,800
weren't more people attending this

02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:44,000
because we had i don't know what i i

02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:46,000
i came to the me came to the chat a

02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,560
little bit late so i'm not sure if you

02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,040
discussed at the beginning uh how many

02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:56,480
people responded

02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:59,360
and um to the survey and

02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:00,800
um i would have thought that this this

02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,960
discussion would have been much

02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,800
much more well attended but i'm actually

02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,920
surprised that there's basically less

02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:10,400
than

02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:12,719
less than 30 of us at any point in time

02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,719
um

02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:19,840
doug is there anything we can do to sort

02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:23,520
of um push this out

02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:26,639
this out or or i'll try and

02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:31,360
i'll tweet it i'll i'll i'll

02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:31,360
i'll shout about it on on the groups

02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:38,400
it would be helpful i mean i i

02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:40,560
i i was kind of expecting

02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,320
around what we ended up having uh

02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,880
numbers-wise just just

02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:46,079
from historical passing seeing that um

02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,960
but

02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:49,920
but but granted i mean obviously more

02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:53,760
people is better

02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:54,320
um so and i will probably write up some

02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,560
sort of

02:04:54,320 --> 02:05:00,639
like review of say what we did

02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,599
this section this session and then

02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:03,440
reinforce

02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:05,040
we're going to have another one as well

02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:08,639
so i'll put that out this week

02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:12,320
on news that opensuse.org the

02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:13,199
the other idea that i also had on that

02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:16,960
was

02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:19,599
um in terms of the sessions um

02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:20,400
given that we're talking to people that

02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:23,760
are

02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:24,880
global i mean for us us guys here in

02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,239
hong kong it's uh

02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,840
it's 11 p.m um i wonder if the

02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:31,440
other session might be better at a

02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,159
different time which would be sort of

02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:37,760
more time friendly to other

02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:40,159
time zones uh for europe

02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:41,840
you're in europe early afternoon is that

02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:45,199
right

02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:50,079
um it's 4pm yeah it's 4pm

02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:52,639
okay and uh so we've only basically got

02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,760
europe and hong kong it's all right uh

02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,960
ben ben's

02:05:53,760 --> 02:06:00,960
then you're in states archer okay

02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:01,360
i think benson states um what time is it

02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,840
for you

02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,840
and

02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:15,040
the the the idea on the time frame was

02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:18,320
um specific to try to get

02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:19,760
at least in the however you break up the

02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:23,280
world into thirds

02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:25,119
trying to get some sort of um common

02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,360
time frame where people could we could

02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:30,639
have early morning middle

02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:33,520
and late evening uh sure

02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:34,320
you know that that that was the idea

02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,119
behind it

02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,599
i think it was it was very very nicely

02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:40,239
done

02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:43,040
we are hitting i think at least three

02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:43,040
continents here

02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:47,119
i mean just in for the states because

02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:49,199
that was the elephant in the room the

02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:52,320
states it's only

02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:59,840
