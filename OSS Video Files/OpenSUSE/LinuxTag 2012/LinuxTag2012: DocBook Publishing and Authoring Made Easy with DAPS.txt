	                              okay welcome everybody today i would                               like to showcase you a tool about                               docbook authoring and it's called dub                               stop book authoring and publishing suit                               it's a tool which allows you to publish                               your book xml sources with a single                               command so why did we develop that doc                               book itself is it's a framework that                               delivers a DTD or a scheme and various                                stylesheet but it has in contrast to for                                instance station no tools to actually                                publish your document you need to fill                                with xslt proc and a lot of other                                commands in order to get your Lockbox                                horse is published and this is a major                                hurdle for newcomers to to dot book                                because it's quite complicated to                                publish your sources and for                                long-standing book authors which                                maintain huge projects they need to                                develop and manage their own tool set                                mainly this is done with ant or custom                                make files and this where dubs come                                comes in and allows these people to                                concentrate on what really matters that                                is doing their style sheets and focusing                                on content so what does dubs offer you                                can of course transform your dog book                                sources into a variety of output formats                                that is HTML chunked in single HTML then                                you WebHelp format that was                                few weeks ago by a dog book you can of                                course do PDF epub ascii and main pages                                it also supports a variety of image                                source formats that automatically get                                converted to the correct format so if                                you for instance want to create                                grayscale PDF for printing or the images                                automatically get converted to grayscale                                from various formats such as SVG P&G eps                                or PDF dups can be configured per system                                per user and what's very important per                                document so you can have a configuration                                file for each book you want to create                                create and it allows to switch style                                sheets by a command line so it's very                                easy to create different looking output                                formats for instance different-looking                                PDFs from single source of course it's                                open source it's released under the GPL                                to or GPR                                           so what's the main benefit of dubs is                                that it supports large product so the                                project so you can do complicated things                                with it very easily it's for instance                                supports profiling at the moment we                                support for different profiling                                attributes that is our condition OS and                                vendor you can build parts of a large                                set if you're for instance have more                                than one book in a set that allows you                                to link between those books you can                                easily build parts of the sets that                                spokes articles and even sections it                                allows you to easily manage your stuff                                because you can generate file lists of                                sources and air files or source images                                and that you can do that either a book                                or for large set and what's more you can                                create distributable archives for                                instance hdmi archives for deploying                                them on a web server you can easily                                build source profile sauce archives that                                you can ship for translations for                                instance and what's important all these                                profiles are I cars of course will                                validate                                dubs also has some authoring tools which                                makes it easier to maintain your xml                                sources you can create a project from                                scratch with the dubs in it command that                                creates the needed file structure also                                has a example document with which you                                can start this is mainly interesting for                                starters with doc book you can easily                                validate your dog book sources by just                                typing the validate command it has a                                link checker for https and ftp links you                                can spell check your files or your                                documents you can check all images in a                                document or a book with an image viewer                                that easily allows you to update your                                screenshots and what's more has got a                                topic for micro set for MX n xml and PS                                gem add mods little bit about the                                history of tubs tubs evolved from from                                toolchain we used at Souza to generate                                all Souza manuals was called Souza dog                                and about a year ago we decided to do a                                 major code overhaul of the whole thing                                 and the result of it was dubs we                                 actually use it to build the complete                                 Souza documentation but whether with                                 dubs wondered Oh first public release we                                 stripped it from all sources specific                                 things so you can use it generally for                                 all dog book projects                                 okay so much for theory would like to                                 show you some things you can do with                                 dubs so first thing you need when                                 working with dubs and that is basically                                 the only prerequisite that you need is                                 to put your logbook sources in a                                 specific directory structure it's pretty                                 simple it see it here we have got a book                                 specific config file that is the DC dubs                                 example fire we've got the images                                 directory with the supported images and                                 then you've got a directory which hosts                                 audio XML files in a flat structure so                                 what you do when wanting to build let's                                 say PDF it's pretty easy let's see here                                 is the Dubs documentation itself hosted                                 and to build the PDF for the quick start                                 it just                                 this command so it basically works the                                 way subversion or get that is the main                                 command called ups with a few options                                 than a sub command in this case color                                 PDF and each subcommand also has got a                                 few options which you can see you later                                 so here we have the PDF that's the Buffs                                 quick start guide                                 so pretty easy just one command                                 and take a little bit more with with the                                 sub command options for instance if you                                 plan to give away a color PDF for review                                 and once you show remarks you have                                 inserted in the code to to the reviewer                                 just at the remark attribute and rebuild                                 the PDF                                 which now                                 see                                 that you can see it                                 oh it's the remarks                                 what you can also do is easily switching                                 style sheets so if you would like to                                 have a bit more fancy output just add                                 the style route parameter which then                                 points to the directory with your custom                                 style sheet that the former version was                                 filled with the original style sheets                                 and now we can see some style sheets                                 that we actually use for this user                                 documentation                                 so what taps does is first it                                 automatically converts all the images                                 then it creates the fo file and                                 afterwards calls the PDF format in this                                 in this case FOP to build the PDF                                 that looks a bit better now so with a                                 single command just a single option you                                 can create a document that looks                                 completely different and of course you                                 can also create other formats like to                                 show you for instance the new WebHelp                                 format                                 another major advantage of dumps is that                                 it is fully scriptable you probably have                                 noticed that the only output from dubs                                 is the resulting file name so you can                                 easily called ups and pipe the resulting                                 file name to another program so here we                                 go with web ho                                 from the same source as we used to build                                 the PDF we now have a completely                                 different output format also with just a                                 single command that is the web hub                                 output                                 ok                                 so I told you earlier on that we have                                 got book specific config files the DC                                 files you can see ya and that allows you                                 to put all the options you would                                 normally use on the command line just                                 like the style root option i showed you                                 earlier on in the config file so you                                 don't have to type them any to every                                 time so let's have a look at such a                                 config file for the quick stuff for                                 instance so here we go pretty easy the                                 only mandatory attribute in a config                                 file is the path to the main.xml file                                 this case it's file located here since                                 this fire represents a whole set with                                 the two books the Dubs user guide and                                 the Dubs quick start we also specify a                                 route ID the route ID of the dots quick                                 start and that basically is all you need                                 to build the quick start if you want to                                 make this star route change permanent                                 just go and add that one here path to                                 the star route there's also a fallback                                 mechanism that is a fallback star route                                 if you have for instance only style                                 sheets for building PDFs in the sty                                 route you specified you can specify a                                 fallback star route for other formats                                 such as text or mail pages or HTML the                                 default fallback format always is the                                 doc book style sheets okay but you can                                 also this parameter specify a custom set                                 of science sheets                                 it can also specify HTML CSS files here                                 and what's more the doc book style                                 sheets are customizable liya parents and                                 you can add a few problems here with                                 this xslt param parameter which you can                                 pass to the style sheets to easily have                                 a kind of mini customization layer so in                                 this case we pass the logo to to the                                 style sheets okay having done so we can                                 go back to the                                 first come on and this time we don't                                 have to specify on the starwood                                 parameter anymore because it's already                                 in the config file which automatically                                 gets written by dubs                                 okay here we go                                 so dubs also supports profiling so if                                 you for instance going to write your                                 manual for a product that exists in                                 different flavors such as basic and                                 premium the documentation will be in                                 most parts the same for both products                                 but perhaps the premium version has got                                 some features the basic version doesn't                                 have in this case docbook allows you to                                 make use of profiling in order to have                                 some kind of conditional text which you                                 can only print when actually need it and                                 in order to do so they are profiling                                 attributes dub support you can also                                 enter them in the config file in this                                 case I've got to profiling attributes                                 one that is for the attribute condition                                 in this case for a hypothetical dubs                                 premium product and in case you have                                 vendor specific documentation you could                                 also make use of another profiling                                 attribute vendor in this case there's a                                 value called souza so whenever you enter                                 some XML topic xml element and specify                                 OS specify vendor is Susie this part                                 will only get displayed if this variable                                 is set                                 so home that tells us that login                                 fractious                                 again it's the same source for the quick                                 start we used before only this time the                                 conditional texts will get this plate                                 okay you notice here there's a section                                 about dumps premium and the hypothetical                                 dubs through the addition                                 okay I've also told you that dub                                 supports large projects and has got some                                 offering support one thing I would like                                 to show you is the dubs in a command but                                 which you can easily get a quick start                                 into into the dot book which is called                                 ups in it specify a directory let's say                                 TMP food and then you can specify the                                 root element of the doc book document                                 you would like to create in this example                                 we'll make use of book                                 okay so now we go into TMP foo and see                                 what it has created                                 here we go so we now have a working                                 environment where we can directly start                                 with                                 so this is an example document which has                                 been created from the sources generated                                 by dubs in it                                 and of course we could do HTML epub                                 whatever you like                                 you                                 coming back to the large project support                                 when you have let's say                                                  in a set will get a bit complicated to                                 locate all the XML files that belong to                                 a specific book when you for instance                                 would like to search and replace certain                                 string and for this matter dubs offered                                 to you to generate some kind of lists                                 for instance the list of files that                                 actually belong to a certain book in                                 this case I will not use the Dubs                                 QuickStart me used early on because this                                 only is one fire but the Dubs user guide                                 that's represented by another config                                 file                                 okay here we see a list of all files                                 belonging to the project in a format                                 that you can easily pass to another                                 project a program for instance a CD /                                 whatever you like you can also pretty                                 print it to make it soon readable                                 these are all the files that only belong                                 to the Dubs user guide you can do the                                 same for graphics and you can also do                                 something that will allow you to easily                                 update your screenshots that would be                                 dubs get images and you can pass the                                 list of files directly to an image                                 viewer so specify an image for your                                 old-fashioned XV                                 I'm sorry I need to use another I will                                 make use of another book that is the                                 opensuse book because the Dubs                                 documentation does not contain any                                 screenshots                                 okay what we do now is to display the                                 all the images that belong to construct                                 that has got the ID CH AE inside you can                                 always you could also pass a file to                                 that command but you can also use it                                 with IDs so that will easily allow you                                 to operate with that command over                                 several finds                                 okay here we go these are the images see                                 list of images and what's more it also                                 outputs the list of images on the                                 command line and you can also see the                                 modification date so that really is                                 handy when you want to update a lot of                                 screenshots so any questions are found                                 ok                                 so                                 although that's also already supports a                                 lot of features they're our future plans                                 for the next release one of our major                                 goals is to support to really support                                 docbook                                                         experimentally support book                                              meta gets a bit more complicated when                                 using relaxing because you don't you no                                 longer can use x                                                        sucks online and also would like to                                 introduce x                                                            style sheets we use and another feature                                 we would like to see in dubs                                          make it's much easier to create your own                                 customization layout style sheets the                                 doc bob style sheets can be customized                                 you can pass string parameters to those                                 files or you can write your own custom                                 style sheets but what we have in mind is                                 to make it be easier to customize your                                 dog style sheets by making use of a UNIX                                 config style file in which you just have                                 the name of a parameter and a value                                 assigned to it so something like let's                                 say margin equals to e m and that file                                 then we'll get passed by tops and those                                 variously entered there will get passed                                 to the style sheets to don't so you no                                 longer have to create your customization                                 layer style sheets but can handle that                                 with a simple config file another thing                                 we would like to see in the future                                 version                                 to be able to create diffs between                                 different output formats when when you                                 maintain software documentation it's                                 it's pretty hard to display the changes                                 from one version to another so it would                                 be nice to have some kind of graphical                                 diff in a PDF and actually some                                 rudimentary tools for doing that                                 existing we would like to make use of                                 them and make them better nothing would                                 like to do is to allow sub directories                                 for the xml sources at the moment dubs                                 requires two to have them in a flat                                 directory but having sub directories                                 will make coping with a lot of files                                 much easier and at least for a doc book                                 for we would like to improve the entity                                 handling and allowing multiple entity                                 files and subdirectories which even have                                 the same name which proves to be a                                 problem nothing like to add is top                                 completion for bash for the sub commands                                 so don't have to memorize all the sub                                 commands but can just enter see top and                                 then we'll automatically complete to                                 color PDF and last not least may have                                 noticed that sometimes takes a bit to                                 create the output format doing some                                 performance improvements                                 any questions                                 yes                                 having it all in a single xml file you                                 could do so question is whether you                                 could do so by making use of these these                                 profiling attributes maybe I show them                                 in in the the sources that would be bit                                 easier                                 okay so what you could do is something                                 like                                 and then profile for the attribute lung                                 so then you would have a config file for                                 the German version pops QuickStart de                                 and specify it to profile for lung                                 equals de you would have another config                                 file for English and profile it for                                 Lonnie codes yes yes yes one of the many                                 advantages of dog book is that it                                 actually is plain text so you can easily                                 feed your stuff into a translation                                 memory and that's the way we make use of                                 translations so what we do is create a                                 profile set of XML sources pubs also has                                 a command for that and then hand it out                                 to the translators they feed it into the                                 translation memory translate the stuff                                 and then create also using dubs create                                 the manuals on the translated XML files                                 it's easier because you can make use of                                 a translation memory when doing so                                 rather than having everything in one                                 file                                 more questions                                 help I would like to ask you if you are                                 planned to support new wiki text formats                                 or mic down files used by deed up for                                 example not only transforming XML to                                 HTML or PDF but also a meltdown or well                                 actually we have a target exporting                                 mediawiki but the problem with that is                                 you have to care about the images for                                 yourself because you need to manually                                 upload them to to the to the wiki but                                 but if you do so you can also create                                 wiki text with that one if you want                                 concern it                                 then so far there are no plans to                                 support markdown but well if Stan sheets                                 exist it would be no problem to do that                                 these wicked silent sheets were written                                 by ourselves don't know whether there                                 are any statute would transform to mark                                 up so we go this is mediawiki sentence                                 thank you                                 more questions                                 ok                                 so if
