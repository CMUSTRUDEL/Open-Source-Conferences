	                              shall I start I'm surprised of the the                               amount of people that are my dog because                               it's already five thirty and I thought                               that people would be going home but                               welcome to my presentation about well                               writing professional documentation and I                               work as a freelance consultant for                               various companies I currently work for                               HP Belgium and where I do consultancy                                for other companies and something that                                I've seen at various places is that                                there is a need for writing                                documentation but they have certain                                specific requirements and this                                presentation is about something that I                                think I needed                                                         last year I started to write it I had                                this idea of writing this and it works                                for me very well for writing                                documentation so the objective for me to                                write this this this tool or this                                back-end was actually because I needed                                to create mostly Microsoft Word                                documents but also PDF documentation for                                customers more and more now odf is                                something that is discussable or                                something that you can you can ask for                                to do but usually those big companies                                they have they have a Microsoft solution                                for storing documentation and for                                searching documentation and that                                solution well expects work documents of                                PDF files but mostly were documents and                                sometimes these companies they have the                                requirement that the documentation that                                you write looks like they're documents                                that they produce as well in microsoft                                office so it's important for them that                                those documents look like official                                documents and follow the certain                                certain formatting that's often called                                the corporate identity so that was                                important for me as well it's something                                that comes back every time another                                requirement that i have for such a                                solution is that i need to be able to                                collaborate on this documentation                                documentation is not good if you write                                at once and it dies it gets bit rot so                                for me it was very important that we                                could collaborate and collaboration                                within microsoft office is not an option                                often you see that people they enable                                change tracking i think it's called but                                still you send out documents you get                                them back or in sharepoint you also have                                problems with writing documentation at                                the same time it's in it's impossible                                while that's not what I'm used to an                                open source so for me it was important                                that we could collaborate on a different                                in a different way and using a                                versioning system is one of them now                                other requirements that were not that                                important was producing dog book of HTML                                output not so much for for my customers                                but for the the open-source things that                                I do I prefer to also be able to to put                                it online things like that something                                that is important was the formatting and                                for that it would be useful if my                                customers could modify the styling                                themselves and in this case the solution                                allows that through a graphical                                interface so it makes it easier to                                format your documents and then keep that                                formatting around for future conversions                                existing solutions use xslt or xsl-fo                                and that's not something that that                                customers can do exist LT I often                                compare it with the worst of XML with                                programming I mean it'sit's program in                                XML which is completely it's not for me                                anyway um something that's important for                                me as well an open source project is                                that I can automate it that the                                please conversion happens automatically                                true make files for instance and the                                most important thing is if you can make                                documentation more enjoyable by not                                having to focus on the formatting or on                                the tools you have to use and that's for                                me important as well and so if you look                                at what's possible for writing                                documentation in a more enjoyable way                                you with all the requirements that i                                that i mentioned you you come out at                                cliff text using click text because with                                click text you can do so much more                                 things you can use your favorite text                                 editor you can use the syntax                                 highlighting if you want to you can put                                 it in a versioning system you can defile                                 so for documentation this is this is the                                 best thing you can do lightweight markup                                 languages which they were various                                 options also focus on content so not on                                 formatting which is nice and it makes it                                 easy because the lightweight markup                                 languages which is can give you some                                 examples you have marked down                                 restructure text or a ski dog a                                 lightweight markup language is like what                                 you use on a wiki on a wiki you don't                                 have to think about how it looks you                                 just have to write a documentation and                                 give it some structure and that's what                                 all these lightweight markup languages                                 do compared to normal markup languages                                 like HTML and XML where you need to know                                 the complete language you need to know                                 what's possible how it is how it can be                                 nested and stuff like that you don't                                 need to know that or you don't need to                                 know so many things with a lightweight                                 markup language and what was also                                 important is that it can can be used for                                 typically for documentation and I will                                 come back to that later as well so I                                 decided to go with a ski dog ask a doc                                 is a known lightweight markup language                                 it exists now for I think more than                                    years already it's used by a lot of big                                 projects and the biggest project that is                                 using ASCII doc for their documentation                                 is the colonel so all the new kernel                                 documentation is written in osky talk                                 and it has some nice features it's plain                                 text of course                                 it has an intuitive markup language if                                 you compare this to some of the wiki                                 languages where you have to use for                                 instance and ethics for having it                                 emphasized and a double astrix for                                 having it bold and a triple are strict                                 for something else I don't like that                                 because it if you read the text it                                 doesn't make it obvious what what is                                 meant unless you convert it and if                                 you're writing documentation it's also                                 important that you can read what you                                 have written or that other people                                 understand what you're doing and a ski                                 dog has a nice syntax where emphasize is                                 just quoted of using two underscores                                 around the text bold is actually an                                 aesthetics which is what you do in                                 normal emails and texts emails you you                                 put an Asterix around it there are some                                 other things it's very easy to read as                                 well the the most important reason for                                 me to switch to ask a doc was in fact                                 that it Maps                                                        simplified top book which means that it                                 has all the functionality that dog book                                 has and dog book is actually written or                                 created to make books you may not know                                 dog book but all the orale books and in                                 fact most of the technical documentation                                 technical books that you buy or written                                 with dog book as the source and the fact                                 that maps with dog book makes it                                 possible to just convert your ask a dog                                 to dog book and then use the tools that                                 are available for going from dog book to                                 do something else another reason for me                                 for you for using ASCII dog is that it's                                 very flexible to extend so you can                                 create different backends for producing                                 different output but you can also modify                                 it if you have custom needs which is not                                 always possible with existing markup                                 languages which are fixed in what they                                 can do and what I did was I wrote an OTF                                 back end for a ski talk I come back to                                 that later but why did I choose ODF it's                                 because well all the others do pin'                                 source document standard                                 so it's an open format that's known what                                 what you have to do to to produce but                                 it's also easy to convert from ODF to                                 other output if you use Libre Office                                 there are some other tools now that are                                 coming that implement ODF but                                 LibreOffice is the best one because it                                 has most plugins exports plugins of Xbox                                 filters to go to other formats and in                                 fact the LibreOffice PDF output is                                 really really good and so that if you                                 generate PDF files from Libre Office and                                 you create all the information in                                 LibreOffice like meta data and specific                                 specific things visualization in                                 LibreOffice the PDF output output looks                                 exactly the same so it's it's very nice                                 to have that as an option as well but                                 the most important thing is that I can                                 then do the visualization in LibreOffice                                 in LibreOffice you have a GUI for                                 changing title for the visual a visual                                 visualization of titles of the styling                                 of titles the styling of all the                                 different different stuff that you use                                 in your documentation so you can do that                                 through libre office and in fact what we                                 create it allows you to to modify an                                 audio file change the styles as you want                                 it to look in the end and then use that                                 ODF file you can write it out as an                                 oddity file which is in fact a template                                 file but you can still use an audio file                                 as well as the input for your styling so                                 the next convergence you do true Eska                                 talk or the other the new documents you                                 create or the modified documents you                                 create you can simply provide the the                                 audio file you you visualized you                                 changed you can provide that as the                                 styling for your future a future                                 documentation which is interesting                                 because that allows you to yeah to not                                 have to program or anything to do the                                 visualization so how it usually works is                                 you collaborate on the documentation                                 itself                                 you then use a ski dock with the ODF                                 back-end to convert it to an audio file                                 and in fact natively you can create a                                 flat audio file and a flat audio file is                                 as part of the standard it's actually                                 just an XML file a clear text xml file                                 and everything that's inside of of your                                 normal document like images and and                                 graphs and I don't know what they are                                 embedded and they are being base                                   encoded so it's it produces a bigger                                 file in the end but it's a flat click                                 text file but a ski dog also has the                                 possibility through an additional tool                                 to create normal audio files if you                                 prefer that but flat audio files also                                 work in LibreOffice orders from a u.s.                                 perspective there is no difference                                 between a flat audio file and an audio                                 file in LibreOffice the styling you then                                 to do true liberal office itself and                                 then in the future you can use                                 LibreOffice well you can you can reapply                                 those those styles you created in                                 LibreOffice in future documents in the                                 ODF output you produce or in the PDF or                                 Word documents that you later convert to                                 coming back to the ODF back end step                                 that we wrote it contains a lot of                                 functionality that comes with a ski talk                                 like admonitions which is something that                                 comes from doc book because Oscar doc is                                 actually an implementation of a                                 one-to-one mapping would simplify the                                 book so admonitions is actually what you                                 see in a book like a tip and then you                                 have a call out with the information of                                 the tip of a warning or something                                 important or a note in all of these                                 books you see that sometimes your text                                 is interrupted with something that is                                 important or and admonitions is                                 something that a ski doc supports as                                 well and i will show you an example                                 later you have normal blocks captions                                 captions or titles for images or for                                 four pieces of code or something like                                 that you can add comments which is                                 interesting if you have to collaborate                                 on documentation                                 that you can say this and this is still                                 missing all this and this will have to                                 improve later footnotes table of                                 contents teams all of this is possible                                 with with the the ASCII doc by default                                 but also with the ODF pack and then                                 there are some things that a ski doc                                 provides you through filters and I will                                 also show you some of these you can                                 actually write ascii art and there are                                 some filters that that change that ascii                                 acted in a drawing in a real image you                                 can create charts with some of these                                 filters or mod ml plant UML which is                                 also a way to describe how an image                                 should look instead of having an image                                 there you can of course use images in                                 your documentation but sometimes it's                                 better to describe what in the image                                 relates to what so that you can modify                                 it and you can actually collaborate on                                 that as well if you want to modify the                                 image you just change the description                                 there are some filters for syntax                                 highlighting as well if you put certain                                 pieces of code inside of your                                 documentation that actually the pieces                                 of code in your document that you print                                 is colored as well and then there is                                 specific ODF functionality that we                                 implemented which is not something that                                 dog book would implement so if you would                                 convert from ask a dog to dog book it                                 will not work exactly the same way as                                 you would use it if it would look like                                 if you convert it to ODF and those                                 things are annotations you know that in                                 in Microsoft Word you can say you can                                 also add annotations to collaborate well                                 in in our back end you can also add                                 circle comments and those comments will                                 also be in your output you produce and                                 that sometimes it's useful if you want                                 to give the document and you want to                                 print a document to to your colleagues                                 and they can then read and see the                                 annotations there as well you can have                                 columns which is something that dog book                                 and husky dog do not support cover cover                                 images which is something that dog book                                 does not support either headers and                                 footers something that dog book does not                                 support from the original sources and                                 meta information is automatically also                                 put in the ODF so if you add other                                 information or key keywords or stuff                                 like that it will automatically be in                                 the ODF output and it will automatically                                 if you use Libre Office PDF export                                 filter it will automatically be in the                                 PDF which is nice because if you put the                                 PDF online the key keywords the author                                 information the description of the                                 document will all be in that PDF file as                                 well that sometimes forgotten in PDF                                 files but Google uses that as well so if                                 I give you a demonstration let me first                                 show you this actually these two images                                 are created using ASCII art so I will                                 show you the document where I created                                 those these are just boxers you design                                 and then you put some information and                                 the upper image is what you currently                                 can do the lower box is watching what we                                 would like in the future to offer you                                 because it's not completely finished we                                 use it all ready for a lot of things but                                 it cannot do all the things that we                                 would like to have so the the lower                                 image is what we would like to see which                                 is in fact removing the conversion true                                 libre office by using a second tool but                                 doing it directly through the rapper                                 tool the a                                                            additional tool you have an ascii dog                                 for converting directly from ask a dog                                 to two formats that oskido cannot                                 produce natively and then you only need                                 to use eight weeks and nothing else                                 anymore and                                                        LibreOffice to do the conversion but                                 currently what what how I developed this                                 I use it is you have your plain ASCII                                 doc txt file you run a ski talk with                                 that file to create a flat audio file                                 you can modify the flat audio file in                                 LibreOffice and create that ODF template                                 that I discussed before and then use                                 that ODF template in future conversions                                 and use you know conf which is a tool i                                 wrote as well that talks to LibreOffice                                 to do                                 true the comment line to do the                                 conversion to to a real audio file to a                                 PDF file a docx file and even a                                 PowerPoint slides we have also ODP files                                 implemented but it's not feature                                 complete not at all so it's it's a basic                                 implementation but PowerPoint                                 presentations are different than normal                                 text so this this will need some                                 discussion with the Oscar dog people on                                 how to implement this so the                                 demonstration now finally I prepared                                 this you don't see anything yet if I                                 move this over this is not support                                 workspace I think is it no so I'll                                 probably have to change my change mine                                 now you see what I see perfect yeah and                                 what I wanted to show you is he so let                                 me first show you an example file I have                                 an example test file that shows you the                                 functionality of ODT of the ODF backend                                 and this is a simple document you can                                 make it much more complex than this but                                 this is very simple you have you start                                 with a title and this is a wiki kind of                                 language you start with the title then                                 you give some metadata you can even add                                 some macros and do some some more                                 complex things which I will show you                                 later this is well it's unfortunate it's                                 not eight characters wide so let me                                 change it quickly                                 let's make this                                                       still readable for everybody big enough                                 your ads a big screen so this is that                                 you start with the the title some meta                                 information and then you have a                                 description of the document it's it's                                 optional you don't have to do that but I                                 think it's nice that you can given in a                                 little bit of information what this                                 document is about and then you start to                                 normal paragraphs well actually these                                 are chapters in a book you start each of                                 the chapters with an indented equal sign                                 and this is just one paragraph if you                                 leave an empty line the next paragraph                                 starts you have a an example where you                                 see strong with with the asterisks you                                 have emphasized in this case I used                                 under scoffs but you can you can also do                                 this this for emphasize you have two two                                 ways of doing it Oh f                                                    of doing this so let's undo this if you                                 want to add monospaced text like comma a                                 command which is what I do for this or                                 some some option i use monospaced                                 emphasized i used use for file names or                                 something like that but it's a                                 convention you can do yourself you can                                 do quoted text double quoted text                                 subscript superscript all of those                                 things you can do you can also do links                                 to other paragraphs so in this case we                                 have an reference to some something in                                 another on another page then you have                                 numbered list you have bulleted lists                                 you have labeled lists with something                                 that dog book does you have horizontal                                 lists but this is something that the way                                 the implementation is a little bit weak                                 so you might see something that is not                                 correct if I'd show you the output later                                 listing blocks there is an example of an                                 fake config file a little bit of source                                 code and by adding source gamma bitin                                 source means use a Sox filter for this                                 block and bitin me is the argument you                                 give to the source block to sort of that                                 knows that it's bitin if you use it can                                 auto detect this but in this case it                                 might not because this is not a complete                                 bite and file so it does not have a                                 shebang and it does not make it may not                                 have the things that that it expects but                                 it might have worked I don't know                                 exactly and a literal block which is                                 just the block as it is with new lines                                 included because by default new lines                                 are removed from paragraphs normal text                                 if you have multiple lines there is no                                 new line kept in the in the output you                                 can add some inline literals for                                 instance for for commands that you want                                 to do to have in your document or you                                 can at the output or commands with with                                 a block if you like two things that are                                 implemented in dog book which had which                                 are never used is the quote of a verse                                 kind of block but the things that are                                 important a comment block for instance                                 passed through blocks which in this case                                 is not so useful but if you want to                                 generate odf outputs some way that needs                                 to be kept in line in the ODF you can do                                 that I don't see a purpose of that in                                 this case either and these are the                                 admonitions that I talked to before so                                 you can have warning and then the block                                 if the block spans multiple paragraphs                                 you have a delimiter before and after                                 like I show you here in the tip and the                                 tip there is some some markings to say                                 this is the beginning and the end of the                                 block and in this case the tip also has                                 multiple it has also a list with a list                                 name a caption actually there are some                                 references here I think this shows you a                                 little bit of syntax our tables maybe                                 it's a table this is a way to do columns                                 if you have a very long list you can say                                 how many columns it should be be be                                 using and then the list will go                                 over four columns in this case and I                                 will show you the output later on yeah                                 there are some things that are less                                 important and then we have the filters                                 that I talk to you about as well for                                 instance a grout fists graph is is a                                 tool to create graphs based on                                 information so you have your some                                 information that will create a graph and                                 a second one based on growth group fists                                 you have a a figure it's another plug-in                                 that allows you to create something like                                 this this is multi-line so you don't see                                 how it would look on my screen but in                                 this case I figure with something that                                 fits on my screen this also generates a                                 normal image and like you would expect                                 there are some others dita is another                                 filter that you can use for creating                                 something like this and here this is                                 actually what i showed you before so                                 well not this one but one of these so                                 yeah it's too wide for my screen in this                                 case but this one or this one is the one                                 that I showed at the end which is the                                 ideal situation arts a little bit dog on                                 you yeah sorry for that plant uml is                                 also a way of creating images i will                                 show you the output now if i convert                                 this true so i say use the ODT back end                                 and i can even say use icons and for the                                 icons use share basket or images in fact                                 this information the fact that this                                 document should produce icons and                                 location of the of the icons is                                 something that you can put inside of the                                 document so you don't have to provide it                                 on the comment line if you like that                                 this will create a flat audio file so                                 because all these filters need to create                                 images it takes a little bit longer than                                 an simple text but if you look if you                                 this is the document I just produced and                                 if I would open it with a more reason                                 libra offers the latest one then this is                                 what you get and this is wet table of                                 contents enabled because that's also an                                 option that i had in my in my meta data                                 it creates a table of contents with some                                 with the description attached to it                                 which is a problem with this with this                                 style this is my demo style so it's not                                 the best one the formatting is in there                                 as well the lists you have the different                                 kind of lists the code listing with                                 coloring the commands a sidebar block                                 some other things the admonitions one                                 with the the lists in it references the                                 comments I in this case I also enabled                                 comments because you can disable it if                                 you produce the output so in this case                                 it's enabled which is highlighted in                                 yellow in this style and as you can see                                 there are also the annotations on the                                 right these are created because those                                 examples were in there as well a simple                                 table the formatting of the table                                 doesn't look very nice in this this                                 layout then the columns for columns they                                 were also footnotes that I forgot to                                 mention which are at the bottom of each                                 page if there are hundred page footnotes                                 there were some variables that are                                 actually made a data and the document                                 but isn't so important I also included                                 two images which are here with a caption                                 so that's that and then the different                                 images which are not included only by                                 text but also with the caption so here                                 you can see what is produced by by those                                 filters which it allows you to                                 collaborate on things that you put in a                                 versioning system and this was with the                                 affected the various files these are the                                 images that i showed you before well the                                 same does this with data all from clear                                 text this is the plant uml which shows                                 you something like like this                                 relationships and there was also a cue                                 egg and coat plugin which allows you to                                 put a URL inside of something like this                                 and that's it                                 my demo in this case the stylesheet also                                 includes photos and headaches in this                                 case you can see here at the bottom the                                 page number the chapter that it is in                                 and the title of the book for instance                                 now I mentioned you that this style is                                 not as advanced as the other style that                                 i want to show you let me show you i'm                                 involved with another project which is                                 called here and we create some ask you                                 dr. documentation there as well and this                                 is more like real documentation so it                                 looks a little bit the same titles or                                 meta information a table of contents                                 with the level Dok levels is to means                                 the type of contents you to be two                                 levels deep now this document if i                                 convert this the same way and I think I                                 prepared the actual commands somewhere                                 so the same way it looks as ugly as the                                 previous document let me show you                                 because I don't have much time left let                                 me show you with the HP team and the HP                                 team is more advanced because that's                                 actually where I do things with so with                                 the HP team it looks like this suspense                                 it looks like this and this looks like                                 one of the HP document you would expect                                 in this case the in the style there's                                 also the HP confidential which is yeah                                 just part of the style so you could                                 create an HP confidential style and a                                 normal HP style and then you have the                                 title this is in fact a cover page which                                 I mentioned and below if you have any                                 meta data a version or timestamp a date                                 then it would also be at the bottom of                                 that page but then you have the table of                                 contents which also looks like one of                                 the documents that I found an HP that i                                 mimicked which is the table of contents                                 and then on each page you will see well                                 first you have the introduction chapter                                 then you have the relax and recover                                 chapter with some information and the                                 note in this case without icons the                                 usual documentation from HP do not                                 include icon so it keeps like this in                                 this style                                 and at the bottom of the page you see                                 the number of the page within the                                 chapter you're in so features and                                 functionality features and functionality                                 so this is more what you would expect                                 from how professional documentation                                 looks like yeah that's it I think                                 there's some some examples of codes in                                 this case it's just shell with some                                 colors in it yeah that's a little bit                                 what I wanted to show you so back to the                                 presentation quickly and then we'll have                                 some time for answers and questions I                                 didn't mention out now of course this is                                 my daughter let me see if it comes back                                 yeah I did I did mention unicom I didn't                                 mention the other tools but they might                                 be useful if you already produce some                                 information in other markup languages                                 because with pan doc you can convert                                 other markup languages or lightweight                                 markup languages to ask a doc so if you                                 have Ricky information you want to                                 produce a ski talk content to to to                                 collaborate on you can use that if you                                 already create a dog book information                                 you can in fact use one of the two tools                                 but the second tool is probably the most                                 advanced because it's written by orale                                 in fact orale I told you most of the                                 books are written with dog book there                                 are also dog books written by from                                 O'Reilly written with a ski talk I think                                 there are now five but more and more                                 people are using ASCII dog natively to                                 Ray right orale books and that's why                                 orale wrote this tool dog book to osky                                 talk to convert all the books to ask a                                 dog so that they can be reviewed and be                                 updated in osky dog and not no longer in                                 dog book so that's a nice it's nice to                                 see that from from from orale and there                                 is I once wrote which is a web                                 front-end where you can come                                 worked documents using a different style                                 sheets coming from superiors or you                                 calibrate and subversion and this front                                 end we'll just show you the index of all                                 the documents and you can say i want to                                 PDF with the stylesheet it's really                                 really simple PHP so it's not very fancy                                 but it worked well and it's still in use                                 in one company where i wrote it for                                 that's it i had to speed because it was                                 only in half an hour presentation and                                 this was definitely more so if you want                                 to see what was produced if you want to                                 collaborate or if you have issues you                                 can use github it i really like it for                                 collaboration as well so you can go                                 there to see what what things can be                                 improved or you want to see improved the                                 discussions about oskido ODF we actually                                 do that on the ascii dog mailing list I                                 don't see a point and having a separate                                 mailing list especially because some of                                 those issues are actually things that we                                 need to modify an ascii dog as well and                                 i mentioned already these these tools so                                 thank you for listening do you have any                                 questions and i think so i don't have                                 any questions you don't have any                                 questions if somebody has a question i                                 will bring them in the microphone okay                                 perfect no questions yeah                                 ok so the document that you showed was                                 just one file so far yeah is there a                                 possibility to have a document with many                                 chapters written by different people and                                 include generated document yeah that's a                                 good question often the friend of mine                                 wrote a book in Linux and he did it in                                 dog book and had all these rappers to                                 reuse certain content in training                                 material and stuff like that and I told                                 him about a ski dog and he's now                                 rewriting he's using the book to ask a                                 dog to create his his his book and also                                 all of his material that he uses for                                 training from one from one part so you                                 can indeed include other documents and                                 in fact something that's very nice which                                 he uses now as well is you can include                                 and say that the document that you                                 include should start from a different                                 level so that some chapter you can use                                 from from level one for instance as a                                 separate article but then if you include                                 it in a book where it should be is                                 chapter that starts in level two you                                 just say that it needs to start in level                                 two and it will just use that level but                                 then as a level two so as a chapter                                 instead of a complete article where the                                 title of the chapter is in fact the                                 article title so it's it's actually very                                 useful for things like that yeah and it                                 doesn't have to be just chapters it can                                 also be subchapters or just sections or                                 stuff like that you can include whatever                                 you like yeah but that's functionality                                 of a ski talk not from from my bow their                                 back end but I yeah it works could you                                 please convert the first flat or EF                                 filed by unicorn to a PDF files like yes                                 yes of course you see of course how do                                 you do it and of course let me well let                                 me first open this and then I have to

                 that's not                                 so okay so I think yeah there we go so I                                 have this this flat audio file here if                                 you would convert it you would do this                                 and you know conf will start the                                 LibreOffice instance it will then                                 convert through that Libre Office                                 instance will it will talk to                                 LibreOffice it will use you know that's                                 why the name comes from you know is the                                 communication with LibreOffice in this                                 case I was actually using a different                                 label office than the default that will                                 find so unicom fuel look for the                                 installations you have of LibreOffice                                 but it will prefer the one that is                                 installed and user bin so in my case if                                 I want to use a new one I will have to                                 do this I will have to say use this                                 instance and then it will do the                                 conversion but it is unable to start it                                 because I probably have something open                                 that is interfering with I had a                                 document still open on this let me close                                 everything including my presentation and                                 then do this again and this produces the                                 PDF file so if I now open this you will                                 see this document as as expected so                                 okay unicon works on mac OS windows and                                 linux but there might be some issues but                                 let me know normally it works yeah and                                 it should work with openoffice as well                                 so it's not specifically to office that                                 that works so any other questions yeah                                 meet unicon pick server to run know in                                 the old days it needed to because there                                 was a headless mode which didn't                                 function and then you had to start an ex                                 fee FB framebuffer stuff for being able                                 to run it without having an ex but since                                 since libre office at least but also                                 since all the OpenOffice versions the                                 headless mode works so I start open                                 office in a way that it it works without                                 having you in X but on a server of                                 course Libre Office is quite huge it's                                 quite demanding leaving office in fact                                 the latest versions are much faster and                                 much more stable all the versions and                                 especially open office as well they tend                                 to in certain cases for certain                                 documents sometimes not reproducible we                                 fail and then you have to maybe kill in                                 an instance or restore to nakum and then                                 it might work or might not work all the                                 reproducible cases we have fixed in                                 LibreOffice so it was a very interesting                                 evolution with LibreOffice so I always                                 try also my users to report it upstream                                 and then follow through because you have                                 to really give an example document make                                 sure that the next version the                                 developers know about it and it's still                                 active so it takes some time for them to                                 fix it but they do it so it's really a                                 good evolution no other questions people                                 want to go to the Linux north yeah                                 social event I guess no I had one                                 question prepared why not used latter                                 but if latta works for you then use it                                 it's not that we want to replace                                 something that works for people but I                                 need to produce documents and in fact                                 the the thing that that I start writing                                 it for was my own TV so no so I that's                                 what I started it with and this is a                                 more complex document in the sense that                                 my linux experience actually it                                 increases                                 every year and so what I often had was                                 that my CV would include a smaller                                 number than it actually was and so if                                 you do this in a ski dog then it will                                 take the dates and it will give the                                 number of years that that I am                                 experienced so this also includes a                                 description and keywords so that if i                                 put the PDF online google google no                                 favourites so it also includes for                                 instance the team name Tim CV and the                                 language and coding which is also taken                                 into account data yogi here means that                                 if there are images inside it which is                                 in this case or not it would be included                                 as base                                                                would encapsulate it and this document i                                 start with call out box which says which                                 is my experience and my interest because                                 I'm a freelancer and when they call me                                 they often call me for things that are                                 outside of the scope so I start with it                                 with a big yellow box which says this is                                 what I'm interested in but this is just                                 a CV so if I show you how it looks this                                 is also using another template so maybe                                 that's also nice to ya ask a doc uses                                 minus B if I show you my c/v then it                                 looks like this actually what's probably                                 not good in my CV is that I try to push                                 push put some men as many informations                                 possible on my pages to keep them small                                 and so this this is a different style                                 template with where I use for instance                                 to two columns to get it on one page and                                 yeah it's not a fancy document in fact                                 but yeah that's why I wrote it so I                                 start right in the end okay you're
