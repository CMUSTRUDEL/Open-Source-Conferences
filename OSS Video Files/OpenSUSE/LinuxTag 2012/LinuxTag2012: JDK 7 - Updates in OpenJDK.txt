	                              um                               so the whole thing was extra announced                               in English and just to make sure that                               yeah nobody gets disappointed I thought                               about doing this in English actually I                               hope that's fine you can ask questions

                              info jetta k                                                            and this is what I'll be talking about                                here and if you've seen a presentation                                from out of my colleagues from Oracle                                you may have seen this slide if you                                haven't take a

seven                                updates well I'll give you a bit of a                                background here in june two thousand                                eleven hendrix toll who is a senior                                director of product management at the                                Java platform to at oracle and he's                                responsible java strategy for java SE                                and java me wrote a blog post saying                                that we are moving to OpenJDK as the                                reference implementation specifically in                                its role as a specification lead oracle                                is responsible for delivering the java                                SE seven reference plement ation in la                                madolla strategy towards a more open                                java ecosystem we're going to provide a                                reference fermentation that is based                                entirely on the OpenJDK open source code                                and make it available on the GPL open                                source license and for those of you                                could have now the way java platforms                                work is that there is over the                                corresponding @j tsar java specification                                request                                happens in the java community process                                JCB NHA sr has three components one of                                them is a specification so we written                                document saying willow platform does                                what the api's are for example what                                language features are with the vm                                features as on its own there is a                                corresponding test suite the tck which                                lets us validate that limitation                                actually meets the requirement                                specification and then there is the                                reference fermentation and the purpose                                of the reference mutation serve as a                                reference kind of like the kilogram in                                Paris served as the reference for all                                the other kilograms out there right so                                this was a pretty big deal prior to that                                at sunglass fish became the open-source                                reference fermentation for Java EE and                                now at Oracle with Java                                                 the RI for java SE                                                     plantation was available for download is                                now the piece of course level download                                on the jdk                                                              is the actual URL it's based only on the                                open source code from the jdk                                          so there was a project to create jdk                                  which took four and a half years or less                                than a year and a half after work                                required son let's put it this way and                                that project produced the source code                                for representation and corresponding                                binaries the binaries on that side are                                 for Linux                                                               but they are primarily provided for use                                 by implementers of java SE                                              not for end users of course you can use                                 me really want to but you really                                 shouldn't because they haven't been                                 updated it's                                 like I said reference plantation you                                 don't go to Paris and paint be or                                 kilogram new in blue because it's the                                 reference you don't touch it once it's                                 done so nevertheless now that we had                                 this wonderful job SC                                                July when we announced that this is the                                 first Oracle of Java platform to work in                                 stewardship and it was developed in the                                 open in openjdk following an open                                 process and so on and so on openjdk                                 basically served as the basis for the                                 oracle jdk                                                        figured it would make sense it could                                 need to do that with update release as                                 well so for those of you who are not                                 familiar with java SE                                                  revolutionary release but it contains                                 many many small enhancements and very                                 useful features covering all aspects of                                 a platform from language features in                                 project coin where we added six small                                 improvements to the java programming                                 language to make it easier for you to                                 write more reliable programs but for                                 example using you know diamond operator                                 to save typing or travel resources to                                 deal with resources the more effective

brings long overdue                                 improvements to the java file                                 implementations for example as well as                                 support for

platform                                 its core and finally last but not least                                 we also had one big change for the first                                 time in                                                          machines we had head of new byte code                                 called evoke dynamic which Percy in                                 seven isn't really useful for Java                                 itself but it's actually there to make                                 it easier to implement new dynamic                                 languages to talk of the JVM and if                                 limitations like JRuby actually making                                 successful use of it both performance

                      reflections or bike regeneration to get                                 what they need to do to invoke code the                                 Ruby way or the piping by you what you                                 have and of course there's a whole bunch                                 of other things in seven there is a nice                                 presentation if you can catch it                                 together jug nearby called                                               in java SE

    see seven release contents the jato are                                                                                                  specifications reference from that so                                 like I said we release java SE                                           we're done we're moving on to eight well                                 not quite right not in release seven we                                 started to think about to basically plan                                 ahead for the updates it start to think                                 about how we do the updates in the open                                 so we created a new jdk                                           project rather than continuing to use                                 the old jdk                                                              polish like i said was effectively done                                 by providing the reference fermentation                                                                                                   project it's it's not a platform release                                 it takes multiple years it's something                                 that releases you know update releases                                 every couple of months and thereby needs                                 to be running slightly different fashion                                 so the jdk                                                           decay and like all the other opportunity                                 project as a website openjdk java.net                                 project / j TQ                                                         is the kind of abbreviation we use                                 everywhere the same for the mercurial                                 repositories so we used material OpenJDK                                 so it's AG OpenJDK java.net / jdk                                       jdk                                 new forum master repository for the                                 source code and like I said the big deal                                 about this is that oracle jdk                                          release are based off the source code                                 base and this is this was a bit of a                                 challenge for us because this hasn't                                 been done before right if you look at                                 oracle jdk six it truly has nothing to                                 do with OpenJDK six openjdk six was                                 created about a year and a half after or                                 after son of the time released java SE                                   in                                                                    OpenJDK                                                              opportunity k                                                           match the api's from java SE                                           same source code and therefore not                                 really maintainable in parallel so with                                 seven we're kind of thought if we start                                 from the same thing and we're doing the                                 maintenance work we doing the open in                                 openjdk and then of course oracle                                 jedikiah's components are not in OpenJDK                                 there are some things in no particular                                 news yadda yadda it's basically based on                                 what we doing OpenJDK and this is an                                 open source project in the open source                                 community we need to have transparent                                 developing process so we can't just have                                 random commits happening and that's why                                 we spent some time trying to figure out                                 firstly how son of an Oracle managed to                                 do their regular updates because                                 whatever we had had to fit it to that                                 and of course spend some time discussing                                 with downstream users of the JDK and                                 OpenJDK how this should work on the pond                                 the project anyways so what we do is we                                 have public approvals for commits that                                 means nothing goes in repositories                                 virginica seven updates without somebody                                 posting you know what a patch is about a                                 link to the corresponding bug report a                                 link to the review thread and getting                                 your approval from one of the forest                                 retainers freret release the reviews are                                 done in public we have bulk integrations                                 for things like hotspot or jack spear                                 jax-ws which come from basically other                                 projects in openjdk or in glassfish                                 and most importantly we've tilted the                                 process a bit to encourage developers to                                 go and submit bug fixes in the JDK                                   first and then back portage                                            and the reason for that is really quite                                 simple what we didn't want to do is we                                 didn't want to get stuck with a                                 situation where next summer we would be                                 close to releasing JDK                                                sudden we have to forward port all these                                 you know bug fixes from seven updates                                 into eight so that's why we have a                                 process which effectively makes it                                 easier for us developer to get fixed                                 since seven updates if you go the route                                 of JDK first and to make this even                                 easier for our developers we use the                                 portunity to simplify some of the                                 processes in the inspiration from the                                 way openjdk                                                            Kelly O'Hare so we have an always open                                 mainline forest that's the one up there                                 where fixes can go in at any time it's                                 just the release that they come into                                 depends on where we are in the third                                 course point timeframe and we use                                 mercurial as a tool so we add additional                                 forests as needed so for example we had                                 forests for new releases when we go into                                 a ramp down phase we've done is                                    update to this was the forest                                       which was released in late April and of                                 course we had an integration forest for                                 the Mike Weston board and it was really                                 busy here for the project so like I said                                 we started in june two thousand eleven                                 with a project being proposed on the                                 OpenJDK list of the open GD community it                                 was approved by the Bell group at a time                                 in July we got our own mercurial forest                                 based on the damn jdk                                                 forty-seven code and then we started to                                 discuss development process in the                                 community by August we had we have                                 developing processes pinned down there                                 only jdk                                                                 to read them and in September created                                 our first to release forest for the                                    release and we started to ramp down                                 towards that release                                 then in October                                                       was a critical patch update and you                                 probably know this one thing here that I                                 spoke about                                                           comes up the reason for that is that                                 it's a critical patch update and that                                 means it may contain security fixes so                                 these kind of releases are not developed                                 in the open they can't be instead when                                 it's released the corresponding                                 applicable fixes get applied to the                                 OpenJDK for its seven updates that's how                                 this code comes in and seven year one in                                 particular had some fixes for issues                                 reported by apache Lucene developers                                 when jdk                                                              october in october java one last year we                                 announced a roadmap for jdk                                           from jdk                                                              that we plan to release a mac OS                                         in                                                                    for consumers of an update                                             quite clear that we had to begin working                                 on integration of the Mac os                                           from OpenJDK the seven updates this                                 started in November with a new forest                                 for that merge and this project and this                                 port basically make its way from the BSD                                 port then in                                                             they're going to work together to bring                                 the Apple implementation into the open                                 the OpenJDK created a separate project                                 for that in                                                                                                                                    released                                                                                                                                          was integrated and we had split off the                                 forest for                                                               for last well last couple of weeks in                                 April and since early of this month is                                 early made the Oracle jdk                                             actually the default but you get on Java                                 com so basically we gone in a year from                                 being a new project actually being the                                 default implementation                                 the basis for belief limitation people                                 get when they go to java.com which is                                 huge for something that's being done for                                 the first time in the open because like                                 I said this is a very different project                                 from the from a typical opportunity                                 project at the boy experimental let me                                 take a couple of years to get done this                                 is a meat grinder that the safer patches                                 I mentioned compatibility in the                                 beginning and the test suite so there                                 was such a thing for six and of course                                 we also worked to enable the community                                 to community as number seven Don Smith                                 who is a director power management in                                 the bathroom group at Oracle on his blog                                 announced in January this year that the                                 OpenJDK community TCK license agreement                                 that's very much full short probation                                 suppli for job i z                                                       download that license on the OpenJDK                                 legal page it's fundamentally the same                                 as it was for java                                                    changes for clarification purposes in                                 particular as all says there are some                                 deepest clarifying some common use cases                                 very specific copy a geography so this                                 was pretty big deal for everybody who                                 wanted to ship their own compatible                                 binaries like mints tributions that                                 means they could sign up and actually                                 start doing the work in credibility then                                 of course there were some nicer                                 opportunities now that we have this                                 project up and running and we were                                 working on seven updates in the open                                 where the community we could look at                                 things we didn't have to do any more and                                 one of those things be any more was to                                 continue to publish or to start                                 publishing oracle jdk                                              license which is an old license unused                                 from                                                                 getting distributions and the kind of                                 God's sidetracked or irrelevant over                                 time as most distributions started to                                 adopt OpenJDK                                                          they become pretty much a foundation for                                 the work done in the bun to and fedora                                 and they're bein and so on to package                                 everything on top of that                                 so in August last year i blogged as a                                 bill delete prodigy Flexjet Achilles                                 your project that we are retiring that                                 license with the open jdk                                                for the oracle jdk and being much                                 closing sync with oracle judicata and                                 open six months the license along                                 necessary and that allowed us to                                 basically eliminate an old license think                                 we need to provide everybody with the                                 same single license agreement the bcl                                 this the timing of this was deliberate                                 we announced in august the next critical                                 patch update was in october that left                                 everybody with a couple of months about                                 three months which is like half a                                 distribution development cycle for most                                 situations to figure out how hots our                                 packaging openjdk seven updates and most                                 of them did by October so the feedback                                 we received in particular from people                                 who were familiar with the LJ alike                                 David Herren who was the previous                                 Cherokee research project container or                                 simon phipps or two marble who was the                                 first guy who did this at sun in                                      was positive on this move David's blog                                 for example from last December says that                                 over the course of a time the open jerky                                 project became really good it wasn't                                 like a necessary to maintain the doj                                 project and there's nothing evil and all                                 that it's simple at the project became                                 irrelevant and that's spot on so that's                                 what we did there and that's why I think                                 you're saying so many distributions now                                 work so hard to make sure that they                                 actually work well on top of top and jdk                                                                                                        default runtime in the upcoming release                                 and ubuntu doing the same as far as i                                 know for their upcoming autumn release                                 I'm as long as I'm talking about                                 switching to openjdk                                                 mention briefly job I see six so back in                                 February Hendricks posted a blog posts                                 are saying that we've updated the Java                                 sc                                                                     support and public releases and that                                 means that at some point in time Oracle                                 stops putting you know jdk six available                                 for public downloads on its website it                                 becomes a become as a support product                                 that customers can can buy who still                                 need it and everybody else basically                                 news on                                                                  used to be july two thousand twelve and                                 you know people are concerned it was too                                 soon so we extended this                                                 thousand twelve to allow some more time                                 for position to jdk                                                     the UL policy which you can find on                                 their website to reflect that and to                                 reflect our intent for this and future                                 major releases and as we do that in                                 February the next question i got a                                 custom conference from the lens                                 developer was okay that's great for                                 orchid jetty capable openjdk six I mean                                 they're all the same thing what's going                                 to happen there and as we announced that                                 we're moving to Java                                                   on Java com a henrik also had in this                                 blog posts from I think way April a                                 section on Oracle's contribution to open                                 jdk six and he says it as the vast                                 majority of Oracle's maintenance effort                                 in the open Jenny community is for java                                 SE                                                                       to the previous release of OpenJDK six                                 should consider upgrading to open jdk                                   of course or to oracle jdk                                             on their requirements and in line be no                                 longer posting updates of john a c                                  after member                                                         download sites we don't have plans to                                 contribute further changes to open jdk                                 six project after november so it will                                 get the security lickable                                 fixes until then but that's basically                                 going a bit and that's I think part of                                 innovation what you're seeing                                 distributions now adopting seven updates                                 and like I said we've been really busy                                 with seven updates over the past year we                                 had two major releases now the first one                                 from as December was the                                               which basically took from July til                                 December it was the first ever jedikiah                                 p release down in the open and it's you                                 know it shipped in the same year was                                 supposed to ship which is great it                                 included a new hotspot version hotspot                                 is to the jvm version                                                deal here is that we're not updating the                                 hotspot openjdk six right so if you want                                 a new performance improvements if you                                 want any performance fixes you need to                                 go to openjdk or to work with jdk                                        of course                                                                solaris                                                                last autumn and then the usual things so                                 for example one of the usual things you                                 have in pretty much every JDK update                                 releases you have a time zone database                                 update because somewhere somebody thinks                                 that the daylight saving time you know                                 should start a day earlier or a week                                 later or there is new government that                                 says we're gonna liberate your day'll                                 saving time so basically every couple of                                 months there's about                                                    world somebody changes something about                                 time zones so you know pretty much every                                 release you have one of these things the                                 next item is is a more interesting one                                 so like a selfie project coin                                          this project to have small language                                 changes like tiny things like being able                                 to switch over strings the long-overdue                                 feature alright obvious to most people                                 it is we tested it worked well for us                                 but enced when we're at least seven                                 somebody actually found a bug in that                                 feature and it turned out that if you                                 worse work had you know k statements                                 with string constants and the string                                 constants wearing embraces the jealousy                                 kappa would crash                                 so we fix that and so an update to write                                 so too got those bags are there and of                                 course all the fixes from surrounded one                                 where instead over to as well in total                                 we had                                                                builds to give you a perspective on that                                 jdk                                                                  about                                                                 you know different projects their                                 friends copes there by different release                                 models and n different processes the                                   update for release was the one we I'll                                 shipped a couple weeks ago and you can                                 get if you're not the material fan now                                 or if you don't want to mess around                                 forests you can go and just grab the                                 source code as a zip file at this                                 convenient download location which is                                 also you know length of the openjdk                                 projects web page and the big deal and                                 this one was this mac OS                                              think this is the probably the first                                 time that a lot of people using java                                 could have noticed that this is actually                                 happening in the happening in the                                 opening the openjdk because this was the                                 first time at oracle actually used open                                 jetty case of an update project to ship                                 and orange indicate on the mac at the                                 same time they ship everything else                                 right and format for apple users that's                                 a really big deal because they used to                                 get their updates later that's where                                 this way so being able to do this in                                 openjdk was quite a benefit because we                                 were able to actually engage community                                 from early on and you know get their                                 feedback on how we integrate the mac OS                                                                                                         get their feedback on box they found to                                 get their feedback on patches we                                 proposed and of course in the course of                                 that we had a lot of really great                                 conversations and then great input and                                 some nice patches from from apple team                                 so so this is the jdk that we brought in                                                                                                       about sort of up to six in the next                                 slides then of course new release made a                                 new hotspot version                                                     in some low-level tools                                 the JC md tool for serviceability                                 there's some ice you know posts about                                 that by Marcus hurt from from the Oracle                                 JVM tea and of course is Lenore release                                 notes but the big deal for many people                                 who are not on the Mac is that the new                                 garbage collector g                                                    supported weed                                                         this is something that a lot of people                                 have kind of look forward to and at                                 lyrical JDK release has been ran through                                 the you know various destitutes we                                 oracle makes a lot of Java code so                                 something called fuel aware and all that                                 so it's it's turn out to be a really                                 solid release we've updated exp to                                 version                                                                the usual thing we have the CPU fixes                                 from                                                                    before as well and then the rest of it                                 so I didn't have time this morning to on                                 statistics to give you an exact count of                                 how many patches there where but a thing                                 it was probably in the same ballpark as                                                                                                      from if we go back to the timeline slide                                 there we go you can see how we create                                 sits the ramp down forest in September                                                                                                       similar fashion created the forest in                                 February                                                                 alright                                                                 breaking right now this one of course                                 has a hotspot upgrade it's not a major                                 one so it's the                                                          in there some bug fixes in particular                                 more importantly for the enterprise                                 users there XML component upgrades just                                 this weekend Kelly O'Hare pushed the                                 update to check speed to                                               to                                                                     Oracle has added support for full debug                                 symbols as a built option so that you                                 can get debug info files to make it                                 easier to debug the OpenJDK when you                                 know as a build option which i think is                                 useful people who are looking for                                 hacking hotspot and hacking the OpenJDK                                 and of course if you look to the commit                                 logs and you can see this being                                 developing the open patch by patch right                                 this is all happening in the open                                 repositories on the open list you'll see                                 that many of the bug fixes really have a                                 mac OS same prefix so we're continuing                                 to work with my Coast and support and to                                 make other improvements Edward Wendling                                 so well i'm the project leads and these                                 dates where they said this had more                                 ceremonially and the real work is done                                 by reveling pathetically he posted to                                 the up to open limitless with our                                 release timeline for the first of musics                                 currently a focus on stabilizing this                                 release we're open for general bug fixes                                 up until mid-june and then that's going                                 to be followed by a period where we only                                 fix p                                                                 critical fixes only so we gradually ramp                                 down towards the release and and kind of                                 keep pushing the bar higher on what can                                 a fix this can make its way into that                                 release forest right for the main line                                 the bar remains considerably lower                                 because if somebody has say you know                                 compiler warning fixes that's okay too                                 just not very critical to getting to                                   update                                   and then corresponding on the other side                                 of the oracle jdk we're working on seven                                 basics there as well we can get like a                                 mansion beginning the early access the                                 old preview build on jdk                                                the big focus on that one is as we said                                 at the the java one last year is the mac                                 OS                                                                       Java Runtime environment which means                                 plugin implementation for the mac which                                 means your web store for the mac                                 improving the duration with operating                                 system and some order of their                                 functionality so that's the stuff that's                                 not in openjdk that's Oh stuff is an                                 Oracle jdk but you can test on that side                                 and of course you can you know if you                                 want to go to feedback you can run these                                 builds or it can just grab the source                                 code for openjdk                                                    repositories to show in the beginning                                 build it yourself it's become much much                                 simpler over the last year and let us                                 know what you find and let us know if                                 you're happy with the performance if you                                 find issues you know different problems                                 we like to hear about these things                                 because doing these things in the open                                 is the mass opportunities for us to                                 actually you know engage various people                                 who just wouldn't be able to engage                                 otherwise and finally let me close with                                 the riddle I had for you in the                                 beginning                                 one word is different                                 ok                                 now we can do some Q&A if you want to I                                 want to keep this kind of short and                                 quick so you get over to the fun part                                 for me which is you know asking your                                 questions though answering your                                 questions and of course i'll be around                                 at the the oracle booth today and                                 tomorrow so does anybody have any                                 questions                                 it really depends no requirements so in                                 terms of how oracle jdk is based on                                 openjdk they're basically bits of pieces                                 that are only oracle jdk like the plugin                                 and web start from oracle there the ice                                 tea community has developed its own                                 independent open source of limitations                                 but not the same but there are also bits                                 in openjdk that we don't use an oracle                                 jdk like the zero that can for example                                 hotspot which is something people use to                                 make openjdk run on on various a debian                                 machines you know that serious what have                                 you which we don't write so i think that                                 the major difference he really is that                                 it really depends what your goal is so                                 if you're you know if your institution                                 that wants a shape open source software                                 then obviously been with openjdk if your                                 is v that wants to ship something wrong                                 with our software is proprietary                                 software and probably going with the                                 pork jelly cake it really depends on all                                 of what scenario you have um but the                                 nice thing about doing you know being a                                 in sync between opening clothes and                                 doing this in the open is that we can                                 get useful feedback on on features as                                 they make their weekly updates on bugs                                 as they make the way out of updates i                                 hope as early as possible in this in                                 this cycle as as the code comes in                                 rather than maybe weeks or days later in                                 india in the run down to seven i                                 mentioned this will seem a petulant seen                                 bug I think that one was filed basically                                 a couple of days before actual you know                                 seven release and by doing things                                 differently now with seven updates you                                 know being more open about what we do                                 being with the spare but the process we                                 use develop these things I think we can                                 engage distributions and open source                                 users more directly more earlier in the                                 process than before and that's the                                 benefit both are up adjudicated forage                                 etiquette whose base                                 which doesn't answer a question but like                                 I said it depends                                 so I understand hotspot is the same on                                 openjdk and the Oracle JDK almost there                                 are bits and pieces basically in a                                 Buddhist Oracle has products which are                                 not open source like for example Mission                                 Control and flight recorder and these                                 tools are diagnostic tools that time to                                 do the virtual machine so whatever needs                                 to happen there that's not in the open                                 because it's not open source code and                                 then of course we have commercial                                 products around embedded systems so Java                                 is seen bet it is one of those and there                                 are certain positions we have there                                 which not in the open or for example                                 ports of hotspot to arm or the PowerPC                                 from Oracle which your commercial you                                 know just-in-time compilers yada yada                                 all these things are not in the open so                                 that's why it kind of depends there is i                                 put this the most of the work you see                                 and most of the features are bringing                                 into into the hot spot actually happen                                 OpenJDK right in particular as we as we                                 set in                                                              j-roc and hotspot together or bringing                                 the best features over from from jay                                 rock in the hot spot and most of the                                 performance workday release happening                                 the openjdk so for example some of the                                 patches that have showed up on the hot                                 publix recently from from jericho teams                                 wear patches to remove the permian                                 support from hot spot which for those                                 who don't know hot spot garbage                                 collectors basically have a separate                                 space for long live metadata right and                                 it's how they put this                                 you have to size it right so to say                                 otherwise if you're if you get too much                                 you know classes to load and too much                                 metadata you get out of memory error                                 saying premium you know space exhausted                                 which isn't much fun because sometimes                                 you just you know don't know ahead of                                 time how much class you can allowed for                                 example naming systems and J Rockets                                 being a vm that Oracle got through ba                                 has been actually highly tuned to this                                 enterprise server set ups and that was                                 one of the features didn't have you know                                 like an empty feature and that's                                 something that made its way straight                                 into hot spot or it's making its way                                 during the hot spot from Jay rocket and                                 it's Heinrich said in his blog post on                                 TV I'm Sarah G back in                                          contribution from Oracle into into                                 openjdk around hotspot there is probably                                 the largest one the project received in                                 its history right because there is so                                 much good stuff that's being bottleneck                                 way                                 but they're also some other fun benefits                                 one of the more interesting projects                                 right now in jdk                                                         the build system so if you are trying to                                 build openjdk yourself you know we use                                 make make is awesome we also use aunt                                 and all these things but make is awesome                                 to think we don't use in the open jetty                                 case so far was the typical in except it                                 could figure out to making these things                                 and one of the projects we had or we                                 have going on right now is a bit ly                                 research project which basically is a                                 rewrite of the make fuss we have across                                 openjdk eight to use you know configure                                 and then to use a whole bunch of tricks                                 for gonna make to make ablations much                                 faster as well as to use a kind of a                                 server mode java sea and multi-core                                 enable java sea which reduces our build                                 times you know in jdk                                                  like half an hour to about seven eight                                 minutes on limits and that's the kind of                                 stuff that's obviously you know openjdk                                 and it gets top it everywhere                                 well if you're all hungry that's okay I                                 like to thank you for for coming it's                                 been fun talking with you and see it                                 move
