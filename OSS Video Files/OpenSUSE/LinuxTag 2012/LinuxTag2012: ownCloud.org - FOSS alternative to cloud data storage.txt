	                              so this awesome dude over there that's                               Frank Carly check he started the whole                               uncloudy thing and it's been involved in                               the Katie community before before he was                               doing all the cloudy things he's not                               staying at my place which is quite                               interesting and this awesome dude over                               there is your spot lead he is also was                               also involved in KDE a lot in the                                marketing he's now rocking the opensuse                                community right as a community manager                                and thanks a lot for inviting me and let                                me stay at your guest room the only                                downside of that is of course you have                                to deal with data over there because                                that's our dog popcorn so but of course                                you don't really care much about dogs                                and that kind of stuff you are                                interested in something else here                                uncloudy klutz so what do we want why do                                we care about that stuff what what what                                we all want of course i have this warm                                and fuzzy feeling of not having to worry                                about our data right that's the whole                                concept of class at the coyotes that                                thing that you know is a safe place for                                your data and they call it a amorphouse                                network of surface somewhere so they                                keep your data safe you don't have to                                worry about your stuff and you can reach                                it always everywhere now there are a lot                                of different clouds out there and this                                talk is not about these ones these are                                the big ones you know big companies have                                these these things they call cloud                                computing stuff that does compute and                                then well anything been interesting for                                another home user stuff we care about is                                this all right having your data                                available on your mobile phone on your                                laptop and having it being synchronized                                actually now currently if you use that                                kind of stuff you have to put your head                                in the scent or if there's no sense                                follow my dog and put it in a shoe you                                but you have to live with the fact that                                there are a lot of evil clouds out there                                actually most of the current solutions                                people use are well more or less evil                                and dangerous and suck up your data                                somewhere                                so this is of course very typical                                problem right I mean big companies like                                to look down your data somewhere and                                then you know later on tell you hey if                                you don't know great the new version you                                can't you know open these files anymore                                that kind of stuff has been happening                                now for quite a while already of course                                in the meantime there's this big bunch                                of geeks out there you know a lot of                                them are here and we always have had                                this tendency to try and you know kick                                the asses of the big guys and try to do                                something about the fact that they're                                trying to eat our data and that is of                                course what own cloud is all about so                                                                                                   place in California San Diego announced                                that you know he was sick and tired of                                it and was going to write this thing                                called own clouds have your own cloud                                and well that's what he did the end                                result is out cults and he's going to                                tell you what the end result actually                                was okay thanks our Lord is in oops it's                                an open source project which is which                                meet em hepl the interesting part is                                that you can actually run it on your own                                machine so you can actually use all this                                great cloud services like synchronize                                your files synchronize your calendar                                synchronize your address book and so on                                but you don't have to give away your                                data they don't have to store your data                                somewhere else you can actually store                                your data on your own machine that's the                                whole point you have to functionality                                the features but without losing control                                over your data

desktop server to your browser                                 and so on we support protocols like web                                 tough where I can actually mount it                                 directly as a network drive at your                                 desktop make Windows Linux without an                                 additional client but we also have an                                 additional a special client a desktop                                 sinking line that you can download put                                 in US history and it syncs all your                                 stuff locally to your hard disk if                                 someone knows Dropbox or Google Drive                                 it's just exactly the same functionality                                 and we also working on android and iOS                                 client at the moment the android client                                 has a better that's also better already                                 Betty available the iOS client really                                 really soon this is a screen Java after                                 of the web interface I think it's really                                 nice we use all the latest html                                         features a drip for a drag-and-drop                                 supported for example we have an inline                                 editors for text files we can generate                                 slideshows we can have a music player we                                 have a movie player soon organized                                 features this is a screen to both of our                                 android client i can look at all your                                 files you can upload stuff download                                 stuff from your from your phone your                                 tablet but we actually can do a little                                 bit more than the standard features from                                 dropbox or from google drive we can                                 integrate with other systems to that's                                 the benefit if everything runs on your                                 own machine right so we can do l-dub                                 integration Active Directory all kinds                                 of authentication so if you want to have                                 a single sign solution where you can for                                 example log in with the same credentials                                 into your samba server I into your own                                 cloud it's it's completely integrated we                                 have features like automatic backup so                                 if you save a file in own cloud                                 you can configure it in a way that it's                                 automatically stored at a second machine                                 so we have hot hot failover and we can                                 also import an export data that's also                                 very important because if you decide                                 that you don't want to install on guard                                 on your own root server for example or                                 your desktop and you decide to get old                                 clutch from a service provider and a few                                 months later you don't like the service                                 provider anymore because it's probably                                 not reliable or expensive or whatever or                                 the better one out there we have just an                                 export button we can export your                                 complete user account important a                                 different installation and everything is                                 is there again so it's really good for                                 the user not so much for the service                                 provider of course we have versioning of                                 files so every file you store in own                                 cloud it can be versions you can roll                                 back to undelete we have encryption                                 which is an encryption of the of the                                 trendsetter moment with SSL and                                 encryption on the server server side                                 encryption and we also work on                                 client-side encryption fodder for the                                 next version we have awesome sharing                                 feature so you can click on a file or                                 calendar or gallery entry and say hey I                                 want to share this with this other                                 person or is a group of people or you                                 can even generate public links that you                                 can send by email someone clicks on the                                 link and s can look at your holiday                                 pictures for example so I think                                 everything gets is a is it's a really                                 stupid concept on the Internet at the

evil SL ace in place our Terms of                                 Service and with own cloud you can                                 actually keep the files under your                                 control with just one click send someone                                 a link to it we have notifications so                                 really nice modification is someone                                 someone something is happening on your                                 own cloud for example on                                 KDE desktop we ever and push                                 notifications already so we get a nice                                 pop up on your desktop with something                                 happening on your on your machine if a                                 shared file is changed for example but                                 all gods modern just files so we have                                 altered calendar and contacts we can                                 soon to this desktop clients with KD                                 contact for example or with all kinds of                                 clients with mobile clients too but we                                 also have a really really nice web                                 interface so you can actually choose                                 what you want to use bookmark

what's different about own                                 cloud that we as own cloud we don't                                 provide any we don't run a service we                                 don't have any servers we only do the                                 software so we provide the software to                                 you that you can run your own cloud                                 installation that's really interesting                                 thing here this is a chance that brief                                 overview we support different storage                                 backends on the left local storage                                 obviously but also we can integrate                                 amazon s                                                                 Dropbox we you can mount this into your                                 own cloud and then access it from all                                 kinds of devices like desktop tablets                                 and so on use case scenario is you can                                 if you have an existing storage not like                                 an samba server or nuts or something                                 like that you can just download own load                                 install it additionally your existing                                 device and just connected with it then                                 if you can connect it to and when ldap                                 server for example if you want a single                                 sign login and then you have order all                                 the nice sharing and and syncing                                 features oh I think this is not and I                                 slide anymore this is now your                                 as we can all do i think i think this                                 light means that if you have installed                                 own cloud everything is fine right                                 exactly or if you have any questions you                                 can ask them now before we go on to a                                 couple of other things are there any                                 questions come on think about how cool                                 it is right I mean we all know Google                                 Drive right that's where they put your                                 data and of course we all know that                                 they're going to index it well you know                                 use google drive with own clouds so use                                 it as a storage for unclass and then                                 have on Kyle encrypt your files by                                 Google you'll just get one big binary                                 blob have fun beautiful all right onde                                 questions hmm i already downloaded own                                 cloud and dried it out but I didn't get                                 a clue how to synchronize contacts in                                 Mozilla Thunderbird without cloud could                                 you give a quick introduction to us                                 topping yeah sure for synchronization of                                 contacts and calendar entries who                                 support curled up in cut off as                                 protocols and I think they are natively                                 supported in and in the Mozilla                                 applications if I'm if I'm right you go                                 in owncloud you got with us to the                                 personal settings page and there you                                 have to the two URLs the color and heart                                 of URLs just copy it and put it in your                                 application and then it should work more                                 questions                                 I think                                 ok                                 I'm no short user I'll have you                                 downloaded my calendar and notes and not                                 my calendar address time Taylor                                 synchronization right looks good with my                                 android but I just gave the unread                                 deluxe own tonight as a linux only would                                 client a try and put my picture folder                                 to it it is towards                                                 pictures Wendy yesterday server or                                 saturday before will that become faster                                 so i did find at the index or something                                 like that on my machine here on my local                                 machine did I overlooked it or is there                                 no index with happy I assumed realized                                 all with index you mean like an index of                                 your files your local files yeah there                                 is an index of course there's a local                                 database it's in a dot C suing                                 subdirectory and there's a like a index                                 database over from all your files and I                                 mean that's if you have lots of data or                                                                                                    upstream it can take a while that's okay                                 I'll normally we support compression and                                 HTTP compression so it really shouldn't                                 take that long if you want to if you                                 want we can debug this later but                                 normally it should be quite fast but                                 perhaps there's a problem with the                                 connection or something we can we can                                 debug it later so if you want                                 ah there is the Q that's good more                                 questions                                 what kind of restrictions can I make for                                 the users so it can I tell them you                                 don't and you're not able to upload mp                                  or something like that yeah there's                                 restrictions we have different groups of                                 users so again you can have an admin                                 group admins can install add-ons like                                 you create other users and so on and                                 then you can create sub sub groups and                                 you can give that rights to the to the                                 group's filter for the allowed file                                 types this is actually on the bug                                 tracker already as a to-do entry and it                                 should be relatively easy to do but                                 that's not there at a moment but it will                                 really yeah there's it's a common                                 request                                 what about the user Association portal                                 and right now we have to as atmos right                                 I have to create different accounts and                                 give the passwords and it would would                                 like to have a picture that the user can                                 be frightened I can give give them the                                 rights is that possible or a certified                                 check okay yeah that's an interesting                                 topic I want to answer this a little bit                                 more more in a longer way that                                 originally and the idea behind own cloud                                 is that it is for individuals like home                                 users that just take it put it on your                                 own machine and have all your stuff                                 under your control as an old company we                                 also support this for for companies like                                 bigger high availability installations                                 but the thing is that a lot of service                                 providers also want to use own cloud you                                 get lots and lots of requests from them                                 and for service providers i think the                                 feature that what that you mentioned is                                 very interesting but basically everybody                                 can sign up and gets in account that's                                 not a very good feature for home users                                 obviously so because of that we don't                                 have tues at the moment but it's also a                                 common request from service providers                                 and we will do this that you can sign up                                 and then you have something like a few                                 gigabytes for free and then if your tail                                 is it more you get more space something                                 that's a feature that service providers                                 want to have and we will do this in the                                 future definitely but we don't have this                                 at the moment because this doesn't make                                 sense for home users of course                                 what's the roadmap looking like right                                 now can you say something about that                                 yeah the thing is that we have for three                                 months release schedule for own cloud so                                 we decided to develop it really fast so                                 we have feature raises every three                                 months and park fixed releases in                                 between the blend features for own cloud                                 or got five which is an uncommon version                                 is we want to improve the encryption                                 system a lot because currently the files                                 are encrypted not really true first                                 first use the password of the user to                                 encrypt a key file and then this is key                                 file the data is encrypted we use this                                 because if you want to change your                                 password this is really fast we don't                                 have to decrypt and encrypt every single                                 file that's just a performance                                 improvement and the problem is the                                 solution is it's so far as so Sakura                                 that if you forget your password there's                                 no way to recover it I mean we have a                                 UFO recover password recover feature and                                 own cloud so you can get a new password                                 and login again and access your calendar                                 and stuff like that but your files the                                 password is the key so there's no no way                                 to recover your data and we will                                 implement the proper public key                                 infrastructure for this in the next                                 version that you can have something like                                 a recovery key and put it in a safe                                 place and then later use it to recover                                 your password so this is planned then we                                 will have a movie player and PDF viewer                                 PDF ebook reader and a small                                 presentation program that's already in                                 the works and then we have another                                 really really cool but relatively secret                                 future I don't want to talk about this                                 it will be really cool more questions                                 how about using the certificates for                                 authentication yeah that's already                                 that's actually in implementation at the                                 moment that you can use an SSL                                 certificate not only for encryption of                                 the data but also for authentication                                 that's in the works at the moment will                                 be greased really really soon                                 um I had an synology rack server so i                                 installed on cloud let server and i had                                 my music collection already on that                                 server so i moved the collection to the                                 to the folder where own cloud stored it                                 but the collection it never show up so                                 can i manually start the indexing                                 process or yeah that's all have a common                                 common question the thing is that we                                 implement a lot of advanced features on                                 top of the of the stupid storage so we                                 have like the encryption we have the                                 versioning we have access control lists                                 and remote storage and all kinds of                                 features because of that it doesn't work                                 very well if you modify files under                                 directly under storage without on cloud                                 noticing it and is basically only one                                 way to that I could recommend or two                                 ways to do this first of all uploaded                                 via the web tough interface instead of                                 do it directly on the storage this works                                 or it also works if you create a new                                 account so if you create a complete new                                 account put your files in the home                                 directory and then log in for the first                                 time that it works but if you change the                                 files without owncloud noticing it it's                                 we have a file system cache in place and                                 this fails in this use case                                 are there any plans for web RP like                                 chase an RPG or something like that to                                 integrate it into other applications                                 yeah you do you mean for files or for                                 anything I mean yeah for file access at                                 the moment we really want to stick to                                 open protocols as much as possible so                                 file access we really want to use own                                 web tough as much as possible we already                                 have a few api's which provide features                                 that are not available on web tough so                                 like for the syncing for example like a                                 nice car where you get the latest                                 changed file so that sinking land is                                 faster and a few other small things but                                 the file access itself I think we want                                 to stick with swept after instead of                                 implementing a second file access API I                                 mean if there's a real use case for this                                 it's very easy to do we just want to                                 keep it as clean as possible so not not                                 too api's for the same this case you                                 have a solution for people running                                 outlook                                 no no no he said something about open                                 protocols right there is a there is a                                 very nice PHP library called a set push                                 implemented by the sarafa guys and this                                 is an activesync implementation on it                                 should be really really easy to                                 implement it in own cloud but it's not                                 not done yet I don't know if you someone                                 is working on it but should be                                 relatively easy but about the calendar                                 the address book stuff I want to stress                                 that we are not replacing a group vest                                 over here I mean if you're really really                                 serious about krupa features we                                 recommend to you something like Cola or                                 sarafa or open exchange that's way more                                 capable this is more like for up to                                    users I would say                                 is it possible to switch off certain                                 features like pictures calendar contacts                                 if it's already f right you can just say                                 like hey I don't like my pictures and                                 then it really shouldn't work anymore                                 and it doesn't okay yes it disabled is                                 it just for one person now or for                                 everyone Frank notice for everyone this                                 is a traitor can the administrative                                 decides what plugins are installed and                                 then this is yeah it's configured for                                 every user questions nice                                 you mentioned your fast upgrade schedule                                 and I just refrain from upgrading three                                 to four because of my supra and read                                 synchronizing clients will the                                 application interfaces ever be downwards                                 compliant of course that should the                                 thing reset android client we have we                                 have two different code bases at the                                 moment that they're both in better state                                 so that it works more or less I don't                                 know which one you used it's it's not                                 stable yet unfortunately so really hope                                 that in two to three weeks we can reach                                 the final android client and this will                                 be stable and we'll work with every                                 occasion this is work in progress and                                 fortunately now the interface will be                                 stable thing                                 more questions                                 so you mentioned that's a way to sync to                                 to unclothe server so how do you do this                                 and is then automatically fall back so                                 if my primary server fails the                                 synchronization is really implemented                                 comparable to Dropbox or two to Google                                 Drive so you have a desktop singing                                 client and you can configure it to sink                                 one specific own cloud fault of the one                                 specific local folder and if the file                                 changes on one of the site is synced to                                 the other side automatically and if you                                 don't have internet access or if you                                 have solar sails the files stay in place                                 till it till it's working good so                                 there's no there's no feature to have a                                 primary server and for back server which                                 drinking on their own so it's done by                                 the clients is it yet it's true for high                                 availability I'm set up there are lots                                 of lots of tools in place for doing high                                 availability HTTP applications and we                                 recommend to you something like that let                                 HTTP load balancer for example we don't                                 do this ourselves we also don't have our                                 own web server so we rely on the                                 existing web infrastructure stuff and                                 also for the for the hot failover floor                                 again but the question is what what is                                 done with files because you know I have                                 in mind let's have that a primary server                                 and doing having a backup server so my                                 father regiment in case of hard drive                                 around first yeah I mean we can like I                                 said duplicate all the files on a second                                 server of course it involves some                                 configuration as you have got a second                                 serve and make it a primary one for                                 really really hot failover we recommend                                 to use her like a distributed database                                 and distributed file system like like                                 the cluster file system from redhead for                                 example or other distributed file system                                 and if a solution if you're one hosting                                 center so there are solutions for that                                 but it's not nothing we really do in                                 olin Claudia I'll gladly we concentrate                                 on the functionality and we used to all                                 the existing web stuff further for the                                 other parts so for exactly don't do ssl                                 encryption on ourselves because the web                                 server can do this and so understands                                 the same with the hre but that's just a                                 great question it's fine okay more                                 questions                                 I'm just curious is there like a                                 technical reason for you to be providing                                 the user space binary its                                             for the mac OS because you're locking                                 out millions of int'l users with a core                                 duo so maybe you want to check your                                 Xcode flags next time you build I would                                 pass is requested to our developer                                 that's true we just have restricted                                 resources and we can't support every                                 operating system with area architecture                                 so we decided to focus on a few                                 important ones but actually if quite a                                 few people requested                                                   so we will do this does own cloud                                 support SCB or a leg actually no this                                 would mean that we have to implement our                                 own SSH server which is probably not a                                 good idea so not really know if you want                                 to access the files over the network in                                 a secure way we we recommend ssl with                                 webdav yeah                                 yeah yeah I mean we have we have we use                                 a tool called seating which is use some                                 of the similar concepts as our think but                                 it's way more advanced because it                                 supports bidirectional thinking which                                 also enters is really not working that                                 well so I don't know if you tried it you                                 have a problem with deleting files for                                 example if you delete a file on one end                                 and it's doing again it appears again so                                 this is really broken for this use case                                 oh but will we use vsync is way better                                 they're more questions                                 how do you manage file conflict that's a                                 very good question high conflict is if                                 you change a file on the server and and                                 I let a client offline and then you go                                 online again and then you sink and then                                 the sinking algorithm detects that it                                 was actually changed on both sides then                                 it the newest change wins and the other                                 change is taught in parallel with a dot                                 conflict pre-post fix behind her the                                 file name so we hope that the newest                                 change this is actually what the user                                 expects but the user don't never loses                                 any data so the user can always look at                                 the other file too and also what this                                 works together with our versioning so in                                 the versioning there are also the old                                 order old versions available what we                                 don't do is try to merge the files                                 somehow because this never works with                                 binary files obviously I mean theory wiz                                 with ODF you could look inside the zip                                 file and merge the xml data but i am not                                 sure if this is a good idea so we just                                 provide both those files and and the                                 users to do something about this                                 synchronization is always the complete                                 file synchronized or just the Delta at                                 the moment it's only always the complete                                 file but it is also to do for the next                                 development cycle that we that we do in                                 two digit chunks and questions                                 my question is a little bit concerning                                 hardware and so on what is the minimum                                 and the second question is it is also                                 possible to run it on a dsl modem like                                 like foot socks or surveillance if you                                 come to the own cloud booth I have a                                 small server the arm base which is                                   centimeters long takes                                                  and this runs out just fine so I don't                                 think we have any real minimum                                 requirement of course it always down to                                 the question of how many users are                                 simultaneously under on this server I                                 mean of course you need a little bit                                 more power if you have whatever                                     users all the time run your clicking on                                 on stuff but it's quite fast i would say                                 so it runs just fine on mass devices or                                 on Reuters so yeah don't don't expect to                                 to saturate the gigabit line with this                                 kind of hardware but for novel use cases                                 just okay we're at our time and so I                                 would suggest for any more questions                                 you've come to the booth and I just                                 butter Frank himself or one of the other                                 alcohol developers there and don't                                 forget to come by the ops usable for a                                 beer see you all
