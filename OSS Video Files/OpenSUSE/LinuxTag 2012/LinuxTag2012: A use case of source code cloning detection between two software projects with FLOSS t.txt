	                              then shall we start                               ok                               thank you for coming my name is Miss can                               yes dear I work for the for the river                               self group and I'm going to pretend you                               understand we made a few months ago to                               analyze the reuse code between two                               floors projects using cloth software                               tools first please allow me to introduce                                myself am a group as I told you my name                                is Luis kenya's I work for our church                                group in Madrid in the grip on Carlos                                University we are about                                          including PhD students we are focused on                                free libre an open-source software and                                our men main research lines are                                understanding how how is the the flaws                                development being done what are the key                                roles how the people contribute with                                with floss projects how the company's                                contribute with with floss projects and                                we do it from a quantitative an                                empirical approach basically we we                                retrieve data from all the floors                                projects and we study what's going on                                behind behind behind the project we are                                also participating in several Randy                                projects and lately we are creating i                                start up we are starting a spin-off                                hopefully we're starting next month                                basically we are going to use the                                experience we gather while we were                                working in in Reverse soft and we're                                going to offer of course process                                professional products and services and                                we are also going to be focused on on on                                matrix above software development                                specializing communities to understand                                what is behind the communities how the                                how the company's contribute with                                communities how the people is is                                involved in the community so we are also                                specializing in offering support to mm                                                                                                    forts Elura which is the brand new forge                                delivered by surfers and we are also                                including this kind of study of                                committees in in the forties if you are                                interested in this part my work made a                                nearly scared we'll talk                                about this next next Saturday so let's                                get to the point a few months ago a                                manager of the provincial council of a                                coruña which is a missing in Spain in a                                regular explain which name is Alicia                                asked us to study two projects one of                                the projects was promoted by by them                                this name was dcl and the other one was                                a kind of a fork or the first one                                basically both projects have similar                                features indeed the name is very similar                                they use the remain feature is to offer                                the main feature is to offer serve                                service to with geographical information                                geographic information probably so they                                are basing graphic information systems                                true to create service on what was the                                name infrastructure and local equipment                                was the worst name so so a bit of                                context this a yell is that is the is                                the tool that was promoted by the                                provision Kosovo kyrenia and the second                                one which name is GV cko was created a                                few years later the first one and it was                                created as a module of a bigger project                                called DBC ok ah due to the fact that                                the two names are very very similar i'm                                going to i'm going to use freight e to                                refer to to his al and play it be to                                refer to GBC al ok because to avoid                                misunderstandings so let's have a look                                at the history in                                                     years ago                                                            was created promoted by our client by                                the provincial council of a coruña                                akhirnya a scene in the in the region of                                Galicia the first version of the of the                                product was related was released using a                                privateer Ison's four years later they                                decided to release the project using a                                freely reopened                                license and they used as a base a tool                                called DBC BBC one dot oh just later the                                provincial council of Ponte Vedra which                                is also in the region of Alicia wanted                                to use the parade a and they contracted                                a subcontracted our company a                                development company to adapt it to their                                needs but both the company and them                                 decided to kind of starting from scratch                                 using only some parts of the original                                 original project so just later they                                 created GV seek AEL which is a module                                 for the BBC the question at this point                                 separate just later the kind of a fork                                 is that how different is that is a code                                 from the plate A and point B our client                                 which was the which was in charge of                                 maintaining deliberate a wanted to know                                 if emerged would be feasible and how                                 much effort both he need to perform it                                 so for this we needed to we need                                        amount of code that was reduced from the                                 plate e from white a in the parade be                                 besides that the outline was also                                 interested in knowing how they go how                                 they call was reused what was the people                                 doing with the code from the plate a                                 they were just copying and pasting they                                 were they were they were modifying the                                 license they were using new scheme ass                                 off of licensing on the third point is                                 that they were interested in in they                                 wanted us to study the functionality I'm                                 not going to talk about this three point                                 because it's not it's not very techincal                                 so I'm going to show you how you can                                 produce how you can reproduce this study                                 to find out how difficult is to perform                                 art and to find out the licensing issues                                 and copyright issues between two floors                                 projects                                 so the mythology in this case we are                                 using to floss projects that means that                                 we are using information that is                                 publicly available everyone can download                                 the information and reproduce the study                                 indeed we are using flush tools to                                 perform the analysis so even our client                                 can reproduce the study the first step                                 in our methodology is to retrieve to                                 download the gold from the both from                                 both projects their source code for from                                 both plotted story so once we have the                                 code we have something to be analyzed we                                 had to identify the tools that we                                 thought were going to add useful                                 information we identified four tools i'm                                 going to explain you later for tools but                                 if you reproduce the study you may a                                 find more more useful tools so the third                                 step is to process it raw data that the                                 tools are offering us so once we got the                                 tools we perform we executed against                                 their source code and we get the raw                                 data it is needed to perform a kind of                                 analysis of the raw data to elaborate                                 and to get the final the final results                                 to clarify the relevant information so                                 differences deserve the sources we use                                 for the pilot a while this information                                 was provided by the client so the client                                 told us I want you to study this project                                 despite is using this subversion                                 repository and I want to compare it with                                 this point which is using six git                                 repositories and to subversion                                 repositories so we only had to download                                 to unlock the source code phone from the                                 repositories and in this study we didn't                                 have feedback from developers they got                                 the good point of this is that you can                                 perform the study get useful information                                 without without trying to chase to chase                                 trying to do to convince developers to                                 help you of course if you have                                 developers and you're happy you have                                 feedback from the developers the result                                 is going to be much stronger much useful                                 but you can also have very useful                                 information without feedback from the                                 reverse                                 so are you going to present you the four                                 tools we use these are CC finder clock                                 ninka and grip CC finder which is the                                 complex one is the one that allow us to                                 say that our code the snippet is present                                 in the two software projects so the bad                                 thing about the faxes finder is that the                                 configuration is a bit tricky it works                                 in a token levels you have to configure                                 it you have to tell the tool okay this                                 is for me I code the snippet that is                                 clone and you have to select enough                                 correct number of tokens to avoid fake                                 positive I'm to get relevant information                                 EG dude if you for instance see you use                                 are a small number of tokens for I call                                 a snippet you can get fake fake                                 positives because you will end up with a                                 lot a lot of a lot of common culture                                 snippets that are not really long code                                 and if you use a very big number of                                 tokens you maybe can don't get the real                                 information so we made a few tests with                                 our code with our code in Java because                                 we were comparing Java code we made some                                 tests with our up with our projects and                                 later with the projects we were studying                                 and we we that's how we get the                                 configuration so the second-tallest                                 clock witches are really nice too is the                                 evolution of slow count maybe you know                                 is lockdown it basically calculates the                                 source lines of code of a software                                 project and it supports                                                languages the third tool is nunca nunca                                 is created by was created by danielle                                 herman link is basically a perl script                                 that returns the license of the of the                                 code it basically search using regular                                 expressions in the heater of the file                                 and let you know the the license heater                                 that he phone and the last one is web                                 which is a very basic tool is our                                 I come online very common in the unix                                 environment and its search text streams                                 using also durable RS prisms i'm going                                 to show you both nyan cat clock and                                 Minka clock um grip so this ninka I'm                                 going to execute ninka against ninka to                                 see what he says and he says that ninka                                 is contains the license affero GPL                                 version                                                            identified the license of this code now                                 we would like to see the programming                                 language of his coat we use clock                                 clerk says that it has a                                              bird code and last are not least we                                 would like to know what's a copyright of                                 the file so we perform a very basic                                 search using grip and it returns that                                 the copyright belongs to you raymond ave                                 and a lien Herman so come with these                                 three basic tools in combination with GC                                 finder we can get a very very useful                                 results this is the raw data the output                                 of CC finder which is more complex in                                 the table in the code left we can see                                 the clones thats easy finder identified                                 so in this example to find identify one                                 clone here and three more here for code                                 snippets that are common in both                                 projects ok if you pay attention to this                                 ID this is the idea of the file where                                 they call the clone ad was found from                                 this talking to this token and this                                 clone was also present in this file so                                 the the important thing here is at this                                 clone which is the same in the in the                                 project interpret a once pressured in                                 several parts of the file with this idea                                 of the five                                                          this part of the goal was repeated edit                                 file in this file so we have to take in                                 background ads from the project X here                                 we share two blocks of code we have to                                 code to come and call the snippets but                                 from the point of view of the droid x we                                 have four common code snippets ok                                 because if you offer the results you                                 have to provide it from that from the                                 two points of view                                 at the end they only share two blocks of                                 code but one project is using it more so                                 you have to also include that                                 information so we're getting to the to                                 the fundament the fun part this is the                                 result for a file the file was this                                 present in the plate a the name of the                                 file is export map to touch java it is                                 obviously written in java we found three                                 files with loans which means three files                                 in the point p have at least one code                                 snippet cloned from this from this file                                 the total are lines of code source lines                                 of code for this file are less than                                     the license heater identified by ninka                                 is DPO GPL version                                                     is of the provision council of a corona                                 okay here in this table we get the slot                                 with clock the license with ninka a                                 copyrighted grip on the clone files with                                 with CC finder okay for this file we got                                 these three files with clone code in the                                 point B so for instance we have we have                                 the file export Sarah to yeah java where                                 forty-three percent of the code was                                 clone which means is also present in the                                 in the in the file import a this is                                     source lines of code or a clone and if                                 you pay attention to the license and                                 copyright columns you can see that                                 neither license and copyright our phone                                 in the in the derivative works so this                                 means that they could be your latching                                 the GPO the GPO close because if you use                                 a DPL file you have to you have to                                 retain you have to keep the information                                 that that is included in the file so now                                 let's have a look at some global results                                 these are the more use for the plate a                                 yeah we have plenty of them yeah maybe                                 we have too many of them here we have                                 the name of the module or debris it a                                 the size of the module and the size of                                 the the code that is cloned so for                                 instance in this clone with                                         there is none Tris there are no lines                                 ground are no lines present in deployed                                 be for this fight for this module al                                 it's cut they are more than a half more                                 than half sixty percent                                               the code is also present in the poet be                                 here we have similar results with very                                 very few lines of code clone and we have                                 a look at a chart we can identify that                                 from this point a remember that this one                                 the project that was promoted by our                                 clients only one module is been used in                                 apparatus be all the rest of the modules                                 are not are not almost used okay so                                 if we count the total total we count the                                 total lines of code or they put a which                                 are three hundred and twenty thousand                                 lines of code with weird at only forty                                 thousand nights of code where our clone                                 are reused by the poet be okay these are                                 very very small a small piece of the                                 cake so now as I told you before we have                                 to offer the two points of view now                                 we've seen the point of view the pit a                                 let's have a look at the point of view                                 of the poet's be the poet be has less                                 has less less modules and here we have                                 also one of the money that it it                                 contains a lot of John code for a few                                 percent so these modules open capsules                                 it's size is                                                           and it is using almost                                                 code from the point a so again what                                 means is that report be is using reduced                                 code only one of the modules not in the                                 outward so but in this time at the                                 project B is smaller because this it is                                 a a module of GBC the portion of the                                 portion of the optical is bigger they                                 are using sixteen thousand lines of code                                 out of eighty thousand lines of code so                                 final conclusions here in the Pinda                                 figure we have the total the total size                                 of the of the project the the yellow bar                                 is the Idzik is the code that is not is                                 not clone the violet is a code that is                                 clone so for the plate a only six                                 percent of the code was was claw was                                 cloned on this present in the parade be                                 so for the poet be as it is smaller                                 where b is using twenty percent of the                                 code produced                                    of its public of its code but it is                                 necessary to remark that B is using                                                                                                            a is often only                                                       means that there are two like two                                 thousand lines of code that are repeated                                 in the point B so as we saw most of the                                 common code being reused by B is located                                 in in the module al let's cut from point                                 A and open casual frontpoint me unless                                 but not least neither copyright holder                                 unlicensed healer is present in                                 ninety-one percent of the files that                                 were reused by poet be so I'm not a                                 lawyer but this could be this could be
