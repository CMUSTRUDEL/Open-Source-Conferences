This talk provides an introduction into Ceph, a software defined storage with openSUSE. The talk is going to explain and demonstrate how Ceph distributes data over hosts, racks and other failure domains and scales with the number of available nodes. The handling of failed hardware is explained and demonstrated. The talk concentrates on the theoretical concepts and a live demonstration.
