so hello thanks for coming

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,930
this presentation my name is Jana Krupa

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,210
like to tell you something about

00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:21,600
collecting data from international

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:26,520
Internet of Things networks using SiC

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,189
Fox network so first something about me

00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm working for Suzy for a couple of

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,840
years I'm in the open build service team

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,640
working mainly on studio online but the

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,260
today's talk won't be related to any of

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,940
that it's actually related to something

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,950
which I'd like to do in my free time

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,940
that's mostly tinkering with different

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,660
gadgets and recently I've been playing

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,990
with different different gadgets which

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,750
communicate over various of protocols so

00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:01,590
I will give you some info about how I

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,300
started with it a few years ago I wanted

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,240
to do some temperature monitoring in my

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,310
house so that means I have a couple of

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,729
different temperature sensors on various

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,930
places and I was looking for a way how

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,909
to do that so and actually there were

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,550
there was a one product with just which

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,400
just came to the market that was a small

00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,740
chip which allowed me to that for quite

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,550
some low amount of money it was called

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,070
esp8266 it's like two dollar gadget

00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,680
which has Wi-Fi connectivity it allows

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,200
you to connect some sensors to that and

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,870
then you can transfer it to by a local

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,460
Wi-Fi connection in your house it allows

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:48,420
some deep sleeps so it can be a life on

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,630
battery for quite some time and this

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,970
this is working quite good but then I

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,670
was starting to think about how I can

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,369
use this even in the US where there is

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,220
no Wi-Fi connection that means outside

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:08,369
of the house usually or somewhere in the

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:11,220
nature and so uh the obvious choice for

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,390
that or something which people would

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:19,170
start to be looking at would be a gsm 3G

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:23,010
and LTE networks because the coverage is

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,290
on most of the places around but there

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,850
are some issues with that first issue

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:33,130
which comes to my mind is

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:35,740
problem with power drain usually

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,770
transmitters for those networks required

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:43,630
a lot of power so you need to have quite

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,940
huge battery or some power source the

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,410
other problem is that it's not that

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,150
cheap to maintain the sensors connected

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,040
to each of them connected to the network

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,550
separately so what you usually end up

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,500
doing is to have some gateway which is

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,200
connected to the Internet via for

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,000
example 3G or LTE and then there is some

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,790
local Wi-Fi connection for the sensors

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,900
or you can use some low-power network

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:15,700
like an RF modules for a gene or stuff

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,970
like that recently there is there has

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,440
been some development in this area and

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,940
there are new networks coming to the

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,900
market and recently it's mostly SiC Fox

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:32,380
network Laura networks and LTE M the

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,810
first two are already rolled out to most

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,760
major markets all around the world that

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,840
means that the networks are running and

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,410
you can use them today I'd like to talk

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,110
more about the SiC Fox network because

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,880
it's very easy to use the main

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,610
difference between a Sikh Fox Alaura

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,130
Network is that six say Fox network is

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,240
proprietary but it has slow hardware

00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,070
cost Laura network is open so that means

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,790
that you can even run your own network

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:10,030
if you want and the all tem networks are

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:13,480
not really deployed yet much this is a

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,270
table which i found a table from nokia I

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,690
think it's about one year also some of

00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:22,390
the data could be updated on that

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,940
but it's summarize the status of and

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,550
differences between those networks and

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,530
in terms of bandwidth and if they

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:34,570
operate in licensed or unlicensed radio

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,960
spectrum so something about SiC Fox

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,960
network

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:44,560
this is definition from Wikipedia what's

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,530
important in this is that it operates an

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,539
unlicensed band that means that you

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,229
don't need to pay something for using

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:55,360
the radio band there are two different

00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:58,389
frequencies so one is for Europe one is

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,759
for us that that's because of different

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,199
radio spectrum allocation in different

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,319
countries

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,940
I mentioned Europe and us some countries

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,419
are using the European one some

00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:14,500
countries the u.s. one even outside

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:18,630
those territories as for the coverage

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,970
this is a snapshot from SiC fox website

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,470
taken i think yesterday so as you can

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,039
see most of the Western and Central

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,080
Europe is already covered the countries

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,860
which are not probably will be in the

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,009
near future I guess the network itself

00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,020
operates is it's like a centralized

00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:40,690
network it's operated by a French

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,610
company called psyche Fox and this

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,370
company gives licenses to different

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,380
operators in different countries so for

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,180
example in Germany it's also traded by

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,820
sick fox company but for example in

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,800
czech republic it's operated by a simple

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:59,740
cell network provider now you're

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,669
probably asking what you can transfer

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,080
over the network if you look at this it

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,259
would be surprised that this is quite a

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,479
low amount of data so the uplink message

00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,150
limit is 12 bytes that means that in one

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,800
one message you sent to the network from

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,880
the from the device you can transfer

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,570
just 12 bytes and you're limited 440

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,780
messages per day that's like one message

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,969
every roughly 10 minutes and the

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,940
downlink message that means the messages

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:32,979
which are transferred from from the

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,150
server to the device are limited for a

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:39,880
perfect day four messages per day and

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,580
they're just eight bytes also these

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,650
messages needs to be initiated from the

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,659
device itself because the network

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,150
doesn't need to know where the devices

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:50,270
actually is so the device needs to ask

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:58,270
the network if there is

00:06:50,270 --> 00:07:01,010
some some data payload for it now what's

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,400
quite good about these networks is the

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:08,990
pricing because if you compared it with

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,640
using like a GSM network for GSM

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,010
networks you would usually have to pay

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,240
like five years a month depending on the

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:19,610
country but roughly about that with the

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,340
sig Fox Network you pay something

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,770
between half a euro euro per month and

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,200
if you get the heart very usually there

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,060
is one year free subscription so if you

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,370
want to play with that like from a

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,070
developer perspective that's pretty cool

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,200
because you don't even have to like

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,570
register somewhere and place a monthly

00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,000
fee you can just think with that also

00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,400
what what's interesting is that if for

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,190
example I'm not sure about Germany but

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,540
for example the Czech operator if you

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,100
tell them that you are developer they

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,550
will usually give you free license to

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:56,090
use the use the network if you tell them

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,110
what are you working on another cool

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,580
feature is that the rooming is already

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,040
included in the cost that means that if

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,610
you are running the device in one

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,140
country you can use it anywhere else and

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:15,230
it's free of charge or better set

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:17,690
included in the monthly fee now the sick

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,260
box hardware that's the part which

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,700
communicates with the network so I there

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,480
are a couple of different hard version

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:30,380
new hardware is coming to the market

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:35,560
recently I choose to to show you how how

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,970
it looks like so the first one is is a

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,310
something which is usually used with

00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,980
Arduino or something with the same

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,550
interface the price is pretty low the

00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,380
chip itself costs 4 euros and if you

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,670
want it with a breakout board you have

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,110
to pay 24 years but you don't of course

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,490
if you build something on top of that

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:01,250
you're fine just with the chip the other

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,040
hardware is a little bit more pricier

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,230
but it has much more features actual

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,840
and this is something which I will be

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,600
showing the live demo on today this one

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,450
is based on the ESP 32 chipset that's a

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,570
successor of the esp8266 which I was

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,750
talking about in the beginning there is

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:25,820
a Wi-Fi and bluetooth on that it

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:28,250
supports ipv6 hardware wise it it's also

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:32,150
pretty cool for that kind of device

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:34,310
there is a half of megabyte of RAM and

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,570
four megabytes of flash memory you can

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:41,030
also extend it that SD card and as for

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,240
connections you can connect a lot of

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:49,760
things like digital digital connections

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,650
as well as analog ones and this is like

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:57,560
the scheme I probably cannot read it but

00:09:51,650 --> 00:10:00,230
it's on their website so now as for the

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,950
practical stuff how you can use the

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,980
device so first thing you have to do is

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,750
to actually register to the sick fox

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,690
network that means that when you receive

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,330
any device for using in a sick fox

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,130
network you need to find out two IDs of

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,820
the device the first one is called ID

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,530
the other one is called PA C so it's

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:27,170
basically two numbers which uniquely

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:29,600
identifies the device so for for this CP

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:35,360
device which I'm talking about you do

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:39,140
that this way from Python and after that

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,600
you open the cig Fox back-end website

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,690
where you choose which manufacturer you

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,410
are using then you choose the country

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,330
where are you using the inn and then you

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,950
enter those two numbers as for the

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,780
registration you just have to have to

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,630
enter your name and email address I

00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:02,960
think they don't require much details

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:07,160
about you and so after after you do this

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:11,300
process everything to setup and you can

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,940
start using the device so first thing is

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,660
how you can access the device is to

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,230
connect to it by USB

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,560
why the breakout board it actually works

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:28,660
like a virtual serial serial port over

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,600
USB and you can instantly have micro

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,720
Python terminal over over that the other

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,150
option is you can connect via Wi-Fi so

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,300
if you leave it in the default settings

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,280
it acts as an access point and there is

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,310
a telnet and FTP server running there

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,100
the telnet server does the same thing as

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,490
the serial port so you can tell that

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,940
there and you are immediately on the

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:58,030
micro Python command line the FTP server

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,500
could be used for various things mostly

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,690
if you want to upload some boot-up

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,000
scripts so if you turn on the device to

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:10,750
run some Python commands you can do that

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,470
by FTP now what's also important after

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:17,680
you all of this is to tell the sick Fox

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,410
portal what it has to do with your data

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,300
because now you can transfer the data

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,700
from the device to the sick box network

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,580
but the sick box portal still doesn't

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,900
know what you want to do with that so

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,430
you have to configure something called

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:36,070
callbacks and the sick box portal can do

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,500
various things with that so the first

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,220
probably the easiest thing you can do is

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,690
to tell it just to send you an email

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,580
that means that every time the portal

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,670
receives some data it will send you an

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,410
email and you can configure the

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,110
structure of the email in on the

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,270
callbacks page the other option is that

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,740
there could be some HTTP requests sent

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:03,160
to your website and that triggers some

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,560
script on your server or there are some

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:08,590
connectors to Amazon Web Services and

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,550
other clouds as well so the options are

00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,550
quite huge and

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,709
as for this particular device there is a

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,959
also possibility to for direct

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,850
connection between the devices that's

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,630
not part of the sick folks network but

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:32,899
it's supported by the PI combs CP CP

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:35,680
device ok so now I'm in the part where

00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:39,110
I'd like to try the live demo so I'm

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,300
hope that it won't fail so I have the

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,300
device here so I will connect the webcam

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,550
ok so

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:19,360
okay so so this is the device and I'm

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:22,029
connecting it to the usb port and the

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,490
lattice flashing and hopefully it will

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,379
be connected to the network and now what

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:30,990
I will do is that I will connect by a

00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,990
serial port to to the device

00:14:47,600 --> 00:15:00,110
should I increase the font size or is it

00:14:49,640 --> 00:15:00,769
okay is it readable bigger I really

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,999
tried

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,999
doesn't work for this terminal

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,890
okay

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,600
so basically I have

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:43,470
code snippet which I will just copy

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,050
paste to the serial terminal and then I

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,240
will show you the email client with the

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,450
message which was received received

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,450
there

00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:22,680
so it

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:24,570
to the sick Fox Network what I'm not

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,600
sure about this if there will be signal

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:33,200
I actually tried it today on the hotel

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,200
and not really here but let's see

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,210
okay so I will slide

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,809
with the network connection here but

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:38,129
what I will show you is the mail which I

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:40,059
tried yesterday it's the same same

00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:46,779
message which I sent adjust different

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:50,259
date so this is how it will look like so

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:57,220
this is like the call by configured for

00:17:50,259 --> 00:18:00,519
email email message and you can do the

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,950
same thing for transmitting it by the

00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:09,090
HTTP API or HTTP API or different way

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,090
we'll go back to the presentation

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:29,000
so this is

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:36,090
the code snippet and this is how the

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,180
email message will look like so that's

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:42,570
basically it what I can recommend if you

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,250
want to play with this I actually create

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,870
a blog entry with all of the comments

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,760
you need to start with using the device

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:54,540
so you can find it on my blog on this

00:18:50,760 --> 00:19:00,870
address and if you have some questions I

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:07,830
will be happy to answer them ok well

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:10,110
gang Oh micro so do you know if there's

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:14,360
in the specifications if there's a

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:17,460
maximum current you can basically

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,530
connect or if you connect more sensors

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,720
to the device and the sensors get

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,100
powered through the device is there a

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,970
maximum current basically or oh I'm not

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,950
sure about the current but as for the

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,660
way how we can power the device it's

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,210
possible to power it either way at three

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,620
point three or five volts but as for the

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,020
current which you can take from the

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,230
device from the sensors not really sure

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,730
about that if there's if it's like a

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,040
complete pass through through the device

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,820
without the device doing something with

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,880
it or if there are some restrictions are

00:19:49,820 --> 00:20:06,210
so I'm yeah I'm not completely sure

00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:07,620
about this okay thanks so

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,010
didn't catch it but you mentioned that

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:14,490
the costs for them for the access to the

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:17,130
network is 0.5 or the to one euro per

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,320
month but is it per device or pair I

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:23,250
don't know account how is it built

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:27,030
exactly yeah so I think the pricing is

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:31,500
still not completely clear because most

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,990
of the providers give like a specific

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,320
pricing depending on how many connected

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,570
devices you have so like in some

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,580
countries I found that they don't even

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,920
list any prices on the websites of the

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,770
local providers in some countries they

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,410
listed somewhere they say it's roughly

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:52,080
between the 0.5 year to 1 year per

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,720
connected device like per one device

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,230
connected to the SiC Fox network but

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,440
since the network is just starting in a

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,750
lot of countries I think they are mostly

00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,850
checking the market to find out what is

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,240
the price people are willing to pay I

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:12,420
guess but yes a lot of the providers

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,880
doesn't really list specific pricing it

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,380
should be somewhere around that so I

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,850
guess they are trying to target the

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:24,900
market where something cheaper than like

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:27,140
the GSM or things like that so and try

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,360
to push people to connect directly the

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:33,170
devices without using any gateway so it

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,900
would be affordable to put it everywhere

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,850
ok and one more thing oh it's kind of

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,270
hard to imagine for me how the

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,520
infrastructure looks like so they they

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:46,650
are kind of sharing the infrastructure

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,610
with the mobile phone operators or they

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:52,320
have something own yeah so this is also

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,030
different from country to country I can

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,410
I know that for example in Czech

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,550
Republic what they do is that they

00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:03,780
partnered with local like t-mobile which

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:05,580
is the local gsm provider and so they

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,240
are using there some of their base

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,610
stations to create a network but of

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,140
course they have to use completely new

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,180
hardware but they are just using their

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,180
the places where they have the base

00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,180
stations to make the network coverage

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,690
the the

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:27,490
difference between this network and for

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:29,950
example LTE or or other mobile networks

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,470
is that it's quite low frequency so it's

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,230
easier to make the coverage even with

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:40,360
less amount of base stations and also

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:42,940
the speed is quite low so they need much

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,120
much less base stations to cover much

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,970
bigger area so but that also probably

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:58,450
decreased the cost a bit okay thank you

00:22:48,970 --> 00:23:00,040
very much is there any way to find out

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,650
if the device is connected to the

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,580
network I mean from like checking on the

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:09,040
website or is there some API

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,050
you cannot really find out if the device

00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,960
is connected right now because the as

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,490
far as I know the device doesn't really

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,120
register to network when you turn it on

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,250
the device what you can see on the on

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,090
the on the sick folks portal is the last

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:30,310
location of the device with but it's not

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:32,440
really that much specific because it's

00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,660
just made by the triangulation between

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,940
the base station so it's tens of

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,770
kilometers range so that that's just

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,700
rough location but at least you can find

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:47,320
out which country is in and you can also

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:50,740
find the the signal level which the base

00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,140
station was connected to with the the

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:55,690
device during the time when the last

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,210
message was transit from the device so

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:01,540
you will you will see the signal level

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,610
the location like rough location and the

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,740
time and date when this happened and

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,230
then of course the data payload which

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,870
you transferred from the device but you

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,960
cannot really do like some real-time

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:17,430
tracking of the device and I don't think

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,840
this will be implemented because the

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,730
bandwidth in the network is quite low

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,980
and once you have like a lot of devices

00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,720
you can iterate transmit a lot of data

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,230
and that's actually the reason why there

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,270
is the 140 messages per day limit

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,840
because if you have like a lot of those

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,810
devices connected in the

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,150
time and you will Jam the network so

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,740
[Music]

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:43,640
okay thanks but what do you can actually

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,529
do is to connect a GPS device to do the

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,740
whole thing and then you can transfer

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:50,120
the GPS coordinates in the in the

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,919
message you are transferring to the sick

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,390
fox network but that's something which

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,400
is not really connected to the sick fox

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,090
network it's like you can transfer this

00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:03,320
this data so I saw some some application

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:05,390
of this for some car alarm system where

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,760
they connected the sick fox module with

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,240
the GPS device to track the car if it's

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,860
stolen

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,220
so it's something similar which you can

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:17,929
do with the GSM gateway but this could

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:20,840
be slightly cheaper and it will dry

00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:22,429
drain less power so it's one of the

00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:31,190
options which you can use it for for

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:33,620
example okay no other questions okay

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,870
thank thanks for coming and I hope you

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:42,440
enjoyed it

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:42,440
