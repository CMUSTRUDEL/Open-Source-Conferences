An Introduction to the most used Linux Desktop*

The Enlightenment project is one of the longest surviving Linux desktops with its initial release predating that of Gnome or KDE, depending on how you count the numbers Enlightenment is also the most used Linux Desktop. 

For several years now openSUSE has had the best Enlightenment support of any Linux Distro as the Enlightenment maintainer for openSUSE and as a member of the Enlightenment Release team i'll walk you through enlightenment on openSUSE and where / why you should use it. I will also cover some of the other applications produced by the enlightenment project such as the popular terminal emulator terminology.

okay so today I'm here to

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,180
talk to you about the enlightenment

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,450
desktop so firstly quick a little bit

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:25,640
about me I've been working for Cesar for

00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:29,330
a year he'll say been the maintainer on

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,430
a of enlightenment on openSUSE for five

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:35,000
ish years maybe I've been helping with

00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,059
that and he got to the port I started

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,870
out just helping someone else

00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,110
occasionally updating versions of

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,200
packages and then I took over doing all

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,450
the work and then I ended up being the

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,329
upstream release manager for some things

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:53,000
as well and so I'm reasonably involved

00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:57,410
in the project although I don't write a

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
lot of code so a bit of history about

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,809
enlightenment enlightenment is one of

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,009
the oldest desktops in existence it was

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:10,509
first released in 1997 she is around

00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:10,509
similar time to the early gnome and KDE

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,740
in 2000 rest of the main author decided

00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,930
that to get it to really do what he

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,810
wanted from what he had learnt in making

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,810
the first 16 versions he basically had

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,000
to start again from scratch

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,400
what which took just a little bit of

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,720
time and twelve years later we had

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:40,280
another release but through that time

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,590
there was it was still usable and since

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,869
2012 there's been quite regular releases

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,140
it's now maintained mostly by Samsung

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:54,290
employees because they use it in Tizen

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,479
which is their operating system for TVs

00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,710
and smart watches and things like that

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,299
so I think I said in my presentation

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,600
outline thing that enlightenment is

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,509
probably the most used Linux desktop

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,360
because it appears on every Samsung TV

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:14,180
sold in the last year year or two and

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,290
every Samsung Smart Watch so there's

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,120
quite a lot of things out there using

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,239
enlightenment you just may not realize

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,239
it

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,140
so why should you consider using

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,560
enlightenment

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:30,010
well firstly it's extremely lightweight

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,760
I have no problems running it on a

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:39,460
Raspberry Pi or a 7 or 8 year old laptop

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,330
it can also look rather pretty if you do

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,970
it right it's very flexible so I could

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,900
also look quite ugly if you go the other

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,330
way and I like to think of enlightenment

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,340
as the choose-your-own-adventure desktop

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,290
I don't know if you ever had choose your

00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,410
own adventure books but enlightenment is

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,200
the choose your own desktop adventure

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,900
desktop because there are other desktops

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,320
so maybe gnome where the developers very

00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,680
much have a strict way that they think

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,290
you should use their operating system

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,900
Windows is similar and if you try to do

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,250
things outside of that it is quite hard

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,830
and sometimes impossible

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,850
whereas enlightenment has a billion and

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,870
50 configuration options and you can't

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,320
get your head around it all in one

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,120
sitting

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,250
and so if you're ever to try

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,630
enlightenment what I would suggest you

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,300
do is you start out you play with some

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,130
settings you use it for a week you see

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,140
what's working for you you see what's

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,600
not then you start to tweak some more

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,920
settings and for me I think the first

00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,310
time I started using enlightenment that

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,709
process took three or four months but

00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:53,820
now because I'm no fan Susan maintainer

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,970
I can create a profile that says

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,549
openSUSE

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,500
enlightenment desktop and if you click

00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,970
that in the first run wizard you will

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,530
get my default settings which means I

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,269
don't have to remember all those

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:11,670
settings to change I just get my desktop

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:14,410
every time so yeah all right and I guess

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:18,729
we will come a bit to some demos in a

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,830
sec so enlightenment is very thermoball

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:23,320
so we'll start there one of the

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:27,010
downsides of it being Sofie mobile is

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,169
that to writing the enlightenment theme

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,670
it is I think probably at least a

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,470
million lines of

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,080
Starlin code which means you can do

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:39,600
everything but it takes a long time to

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:43,620
do it and so not many people have but

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:51,190
here is enlightenment this is the

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:55,690
default upstream theme we don't open the

00:04:51,190 --> 00:05:00,220
settings because it's nice when you find

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:04,090
a bug in the live demo say enlightenment

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,250
has this nice gray look by default an

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:13,750
open Caesar we have customized that a

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:27,700
bit and the leap at least it looks like

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:32,310
not that nega Phillipe it looks like

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,310
this it's a bit darker it's green if I

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,620
set the wallpaper back

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,030
so this is enlightenment as you would

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,170
see it if you were to use it on leap or

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,700
equal if you were to use it on

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,340
tumbleweed because I don't think I wrote

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:58,390
a separate tumbleweed theme yet

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:06,370
but alongside that in openSUSE we also

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:09,010
ship some other themes there is this

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,910
theme here which if you've been using

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:16,380
open Caesar for a while that was a

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:23,960
earlier theme and then

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:26,910
go back I think even the further and to

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,610
here and because people like these old

00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,710
themes I keep him in optional optional

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,070
packages and you can use them if you

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,640
want I also do some theme work on my

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:42,900
spare time and so here is one that is

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:47,880
very much a work in progress but sort of

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:52,020
close to done then if you like Windows 7

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,230
and using a bit more CPU power you can

00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:00,420
have these nice fancy ones with blurs

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,590
and shading and as you can see there is

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:09,810
obviously parts of this thing that I

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:12,360
haven't finished yet and I was saying

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,030
with enlightenment you can go a bit too

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,830
far and a bit crazy for everyone's

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:23,610
enjoyment here is a fun wallpaper that

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,590
everyone has always wanted ever I don't

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,500
know who made that or why they made that

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,770
but it uses a significant amount of your

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,190
CPU and so you probably don't want to

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,190
use it normally

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,990
[Music]

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,420
so I guess something I forgot to touch

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:50,550
on is why I started using enlightenment

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:51,180
back around 2010 when gnome tea was

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,670
still around

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,970
I used to use gnome tea and I would run

00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:58,500
an X server for each screen which meant

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,600
I couldn't drag applications from one

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,150
screen to the other screen but when I

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,260
changed Burchell desktops on one screen

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,450
the second screen would stay where it

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,490
was I changed my virtual desktop on the

00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,550
second screen the first one would stay

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,880
where it was and for me that was really

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:18,150
useful because like if I'm sitting at

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,790
home I will have my laptop here but also

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,350
have a bigger monitor plugged in and

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,020
generally I want to keep my IRC client

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,660
or some other application just sitting

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,330
on one screen while I swap between the

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,339
editor and my mail client

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,190
everything else and so for me that is

00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,740
why I started using enlightenment it's

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,169
why I still use it because gnome and KDE

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:47,990
don't think that's a good idea don't

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:50,550
think you should be able to do that so

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,510
the Enlightenment project is bigger than

00:08:50,550 --> 00:09:00,410
just a desktop they produce some other

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:03,959
applications I've listed here so I think

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:08,279
we will have a quick look at its

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,940
terminal so if this is terminology it is

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,640
enlightenment

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,720
terminal it can do everything your

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:29,279
normal terminal would do you can split

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:31,410
things in many different ways but unlike

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,399
most of the other terminals of these

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,070
features this terminal is still really

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,839
fast it's as fast if not faster the next

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,709
term and if you have an application

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,560
that's outputting a thousand or 10,000

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,000
lines to your console every second how

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,000
fast your terminal can display those

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,399
lines has an implication on how long it

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,740
takes to do things um but then on top of

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,060
that they take things to another level

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,060
as they like to do

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:24,560
so if I go to a directory with lots of

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:27,040
images in it I can do LS but that's not

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,770
telling me much that's not very useful

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:35,780
you can see some files but if I do T y

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:45,070
LS you get nice little previews when

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:45,070
they come up sometimes if I'm broken up

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,740
I'm going to

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,209
oh that again because I think I change

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,209
the text font and that probably broke it

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:09,019
here we go so T yl s LS with image

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:12,949
previews that you can click on and these

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:15,920
are all very small images that being

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:18,529
able to use an image is cool and nice

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,050
but what if you wanted to watch a video

00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:38,420
on your terminal that's something people

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:45,110
want to do all the time right so we also

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:49,550
have T Y cap I have some in here

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:55,279
you can also cut a picture if you want

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:58,699
to look at it in a bigger size but not

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,850
only can you cut pictures you can take a

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:04,459
video of one of the funniest bugs I've

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:12,939
seen in a while and you can watch a

00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:17,540
video in your terminal now you may ask

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:19,209
why would you include a feature such of

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,769
this as this in your terminal emulator

00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:22,910
well if you're a younger desktop

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:25,430
environment and you don't have many

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,519
applications and you want to test your

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,800
video tip video playing library but all

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,819
you've got is a terminal emulator you

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:42,079
may as well make the terminal play

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:45,769
videos but on these days these days are

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,870
they also have a M player like clone but

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:51,939
in the typical Enlightenment way it is

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,939
much prettier it's called reg

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:09,400
see see it's got some nice pretty

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:11,950
looking bits um but other than that it's

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:23,790
just like Empire can use a g-string or a

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:26,770
VLC backend and so that's fun um so

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,660
another application that I use a lot

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,340
that isn't part of the Enlightenment

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,130
project but it works with enlightenment

00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,850
and it works with many other desktops is

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:39,880
a program called variety now you may

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,490
have noticed that as we've been going my

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,830
wallpaper has been changing every few

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,480
minutes I don't like the same wallpaper

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,650
all the time

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,180
neither does some other people so they

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,180
wrote this program called variety and

00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,940
show you what it is it runs in your

00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,820
sister you get a bunch of different

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,580
sources from over the Internet and you

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,430
can configure it in such a way that it

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,330
will download you a new wallpaper from

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,950
one of those places every 10 minutes and

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,790
it will also change your wallpaper every

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:22,780
five minutes so at the moment I just

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:25,090
have my favorites on say the Internet

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,259
has found me all these wallpapers once

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,259
[Music]

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,980
and so that

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,100
all I believe that still runs with gnome

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,990
KDE whichever desktop environment if you

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:49,970
like lots of wallpapers variety as a

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:52,190
program for you area and see going to

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,690
jump around a little bit but before I

00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:59,480
said enlightenment had lots of settings

00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:02,899
so here is all the settings panes so I

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,380
have I have mine in a very non blingy

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:14,630
configuration because to me animations

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:17,570
are annoying but if I add it to

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,080
everything then now we start getting

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,600
funky animations when you minimize and

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:29,330
maximize and all those things you could

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:32,180
want to do wobbly windows enlightenment

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,649
was the only desktop that has

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,329
implemented wobbly windows on the

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,040
Wayland but since then they it was done

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:42,260
using a bunch of hacks in someone's

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,970
spare time and since then they have

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,000
decided it's not quite stable and

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:50,540
suitable for everyday inclusion so it's

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,800
been disabled for now but there is not

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,800
what we wouldn't lose at the moment but

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I always found Mobley windows annoying

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:11,079
well I'm gonna set that back to

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:13,070
listening mode maybe um so from

00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,339
enlightenment you can also set your

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,970
theme for your JDK applications you can

00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:24,230
set your icon theme as you can see I

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,760
hope 50-billion because one of the

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,279
things you find that when you work on

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,540
themes all the time it gets to a point

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,029
where you just don't care where your

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,740
desktop looks like because it's always

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:40,430
broken and so that is what I have a bit

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,550
of today umm some of the other

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,360
things you can do is you can configure

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:51,260
your startup applications so you can

00:16:47,360 --> 00:17:00,260
automatically launch any application at

00:16:51,260 --> 00:17:04,819
startup so for example I have synergy

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:06,740
sitting up here because I use it at home

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:13,910
and so that just starts what it

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:17,650
magically but I could then decide that I

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:21,800
wanted to start here and so I can set up

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,650
something called a window remember and

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:28,820
so I can remember its size and position

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:37,070
and now it will always start there for

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:37,940
me out the way you can do far more than

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,800
that

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,390
if you like desktop gadgets

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:46,910
enlightenment has a few but not a large

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:51,640
number and so what I've done in the past

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:56,090
is you take an application like conky

00:17:51,640 --> 00:18:09,380
and I can go well I want it to sit here

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:11,360
I want it to use a different border the

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:20,360
risk of eating on my CPU I'm going to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:30,700
try use a blurred border I pick the

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:38,760
wrong one or you can select

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:49,800
a border that's the one I wanted to say

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:49,800
now what my controls are gone I can I

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,550
have just stuffed up and done that and

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,430
completely the wrong order now that I

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,270
don't have the window border I can't

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:16,300
change the rest of the window properties

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:19,390
but just you will making a and as is

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,820
bound to happen I have started using too

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,520
much CPU and one of the nice things

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,170
about in alignment is if it crashes you

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:45,430
can just restart it and everything will

00:19:26,170 --> 00:20:08,740
be as it was sometimes let's take a

00:19:45,430 --> 00:20:17,289
quick break and either

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:25,890
my password so you can see that synergy

00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:25,890
oh it's not started there this time but

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,240
so as you can see enlightenment still

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,409
has some rough edges occasionally it's

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,960
maybe not for anyone

00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,690
everyone but it's really targeting the

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,789
power users who want to be able to do

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,429
everything and anything so let's let's

00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:53,080
try this demo again say at this time if

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:55,299
I make it sticky it's on all the windows

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,669
I've also set up the window hints for

00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:01,960
conky so that it doesn't show up in my

00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:07,179
taskbar or in a bunch of other places

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:20,789
where you list the windows and so by

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:23,049
changing the border here we now have

00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:27,010
what you might consider the equivalent

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:29,830
of a desktop gadget in other um district

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,130
in other desktops I also used to have a

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:38,039
script for showing up photos in a photo

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,039
frame using Phet it was similar concept

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:50,880
and we don't the time all right

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,610
come back for our walk through the

00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:00,249
settings one thing enlightenment does

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,129
really well is handling multiple

00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,869
monitors I plugged monitor I plugged my

00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:08,039
HDMI port in and out of this all the

00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:14,080
time at home everything just works and

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:16,330
is wonderful so you can see you can go

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,409
through there is several different ways

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:24,399
you can choose how your windows are

00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:27,820
focus there is settings for everything

00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:32,200
you could want and probably more there

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:39,909
is an extensive list of things you can

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:43,779
create as key bindings and say and in

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:46,359
light of Antwerp Soph a modular system

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,850
say if you want your system to be even

00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,859
faster you can go through find all the

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,919
modules you don't want to use and

00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:59,859
disable them I think I have a pretty

00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:02,049
default list at the moment alright so I

00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:14,799
think I'll probably leave it there is

00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:16,980
any questions much better much much

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:24,039
better I'm probably more on par with

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:26,080
xfce LXDE I have for a number of years

00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,289
before I started working at Caesar my

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,119
laptop was eight years old I did all my

00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,119
work on it in lime and ran fine

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,540
a question regarding runner does it

00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,299
support to context search I mean if you

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:49,400
type or editor will it show your ad

00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:53,809
add-on for example not at the moment now

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:57,140
Monica's environment hasn't hooked into

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,640
the new fancy app data thing everyone

00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,150
else is using for their package managers

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,470
yet and so it doesn't have the way to

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,920
pull that data out it just looks at

00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,720
desktop files just for me ke raba

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:24,650
reviews only sync which holds me on

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:28,190
Cathy okay anyone else does it in

00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:33,830
hibernation is it working with out of

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:35,600
the box or give to somehow hey kid last

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:39,410
time I used it was working out of the

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,160
box at the moment it is disabled and so

00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:47,419
I think that is more to do with my

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,830
system configuration and not having a

00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,830
swap petition and things like that

00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:59,090
and what about the integration in the

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,330
openSUSE ecosystem like open QA is that

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,760
are there any tests there is a limited

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:10,400
number of tests that I am working on

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:14,090
adding more C but we have a basic start

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,340
up open a terminal and things like that

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:20,169
but there certainly could be many more

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:24,440
tests and as you can see my package

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,450
indicator icon here that's integrated

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,240
into

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,740
package kit and will you can press a

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,570
button if you have updates and it will

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,660
launch just for you to install those

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:39,049
updates so there is some integration

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:42,110
there and we have several fixed arm

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:45,860
patches for the first run wizard that

00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,690
make more sense for openSUSE because we

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,220
have some things pre-configured that

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:57,710
other distros don't and so we

00:25:49,220 --> 00:26:01,100
need to ask you again next are you

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,600
keeping on track between the builds for

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,429
the different architecture so for

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,289
instance with arm and x86 etc or as I'm

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:11,289
working I try to I have done a better

00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,490
job in the past of doing it but

00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:16,970
certainly I have had it running on arm

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,409
systems and it has run on arm systems

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,110
and it does build sometimes an arm

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,520
systems other day other days I look in

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,809
OBS at the arm build and it's got 500

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,450
unresolved dependencies in I won't go

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:32,299
well I can't do much about that today

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:34,370
but yes we try and fix specific issues

00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:43,250
and weave up screamed a couple of

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:46,010
patches for arm you said that some song

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:49,640
is currently contributing a lot into

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:52,400
enlightenment but how its works does

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,559
they direct pull requests to some

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,020
project or it's some kind of upstream

00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:01,510
and they share it with open source

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:04,010
community just a part of their work so

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:07,210
Samsung's approach to their open source

00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:11,690
software stack I've been told as much of

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,640
we will take the contributors and we

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,950
will the main contributors and we will

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,659
pay them to keep doing what they are

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,289
doing because they know what's best for

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,880
the project and so there is four or five

00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:25,240
Samsung developers who are regularly

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,179
committing in to the upstream

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,679
enlightenment and its libraries

00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:34,669
repositories but then I think they also

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:37,220
have a internal branch for Tizen that

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:41,650
they try and merge and do things with

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,650
with extra developers things

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:52,620
are their desktop seems that are not

00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:55,380
black-on-black if this seems very very

00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,260
popular with all desktops to only have

00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,929
black background with slightly less

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,730
black Scripture but I yeah something

00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:05,190
like that would be a nice scene um

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:09,630
yes there is and I think up I think I

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,130
briefly showed one but because it's

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,049
actually what I despise about know

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,690
because you there's only the black theme

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:18,210
and all the others are broken and and

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,799
not not broken that colors are not

00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,779
correct that they are actually unusable

00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:24,870
because genome the team actually is code

00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:27,390
apparently so that yeah is this the same

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,460
with in light minor is it really just a

00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,049
a file where colors are defined which

00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,299
you can change without breaking the test

00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:35,279
though because because the theme is so

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,899
big into the millions of lines of code

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,070
when you do make a light theme it is

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:42,360
something that will work and fits

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:45,390
perfectly I'll show you that in a minute

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,010
before we do I get the choice chance to

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,730
show you this environment has crashed

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:53,520
which is mostly due to my theme now when

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:56,880
you have a desktop that you've run from

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,620
get for 12 years it crashes occasionally

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
and so it's nice when your desktop

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,390
crushes to be able to press a recover

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,620
button and enlightenment comes back or

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,159
your applications are where they were

00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,480
and everything keeps working normally

00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:14,039
now let's see if I can open the menu

00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:18,149
that so obviously the theme that I've

00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,640
landed on is a development one that's

00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:24,059
pushing the system's

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,220
bit further so here is so here is one of

00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:29,220
the lighter changes

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,039
Thanks and is it is it actually the

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,010
theming like in gnome where it's a code

00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,649
that this needs to be made or is it just

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,120
the theming is just a configuration file

00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:42,020
where the colors are defined and not

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,220
everything else um it is a full-blown

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,750
lots of lines of okay so actually

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,179
there's there's also the chance liking

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,260
gnome that you change the theme that you

00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,200
just want to change the colors and

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,169
nothing works anymore now this you can

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,269
if

00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:00,399
you just change the colors I've got most

00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,499
of the themes I've made scripts that

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,759
just change the colors and then I go

00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:08,889
through and tweaks and other things but

00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:10,419
if we say have a look here as you can

00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:13,379
guess from my questions I had quite some

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:20,080
some pain with other test environments

00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:20,559
so I think we are short on time but it's

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,320
fine

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,570
the file manager is the file manager

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:31,899
theme which we will open quickly and

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:36,820
then I will run away well I will show

00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:39,909
you afterwards it's probably 2,000 plus

00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,640
lines of code so you can do everything

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:49,119
with it all right thank you guys

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,119
