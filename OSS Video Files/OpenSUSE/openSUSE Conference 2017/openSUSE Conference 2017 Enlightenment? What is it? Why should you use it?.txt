An Introduction to the most used Linux Desktop*

The Enlightenment project is one of the longest surviving Linux desktops with its initial release predating that of Gnome or KDE, depending on how you count the numbers Enlightenment is also the most used Linux Desktop. 

For several years now openSUSE has had the best Enlightenment support of any Linux Distro as the Enlightenment maintainer for openSUSE and as a member of the Enlightenment Release team i'll walk you through enlightenment on openSUSE and where / why you should use it. I will also cover some of the other applications produced by the enlightenment project such as the popular terminal emulator terminology.
