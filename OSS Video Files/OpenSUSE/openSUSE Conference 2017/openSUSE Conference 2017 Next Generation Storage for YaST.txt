Why Users should look forward to the Redesign.

The YaST team is currently redesigning the storage code, down from the library
up to the UI. This will allow many new features, e.g. btrfs multi device
support, encrypted root, bcache and whole disk usage. We will explain the new
internal design allowing much more flexable setups than in the past and some
of the features for end users.
