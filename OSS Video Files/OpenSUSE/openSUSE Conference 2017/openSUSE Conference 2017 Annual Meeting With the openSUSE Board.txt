all right then okay so with the board

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,750
this is the last the last thing the

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,230
final stretch everybody had a good time

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,180
yeah go see so we did something a little

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,529
bit different this year normally every

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,320
year you know after the board get

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,660
elected we have a big annual meeting

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,390
where Sousa hosters and we visit Sousa

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,270
and we basically spent several days

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,739
locked in meeting rooms discussing about

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,090
you know what does the project need to

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,030
have done what you know what do we need

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,160
to sort out etc and we normally do this

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,570
in like Easter time but you know as you

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
will remember we had a few problems with

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,370
our election tolling this year so we

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,610
didn't actually get the election finish

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,020
till later on so we had that meeting the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,730
last three days before the openSUSE

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,140
conference which is why we all look so

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,960
tired because we've been here for six

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,820
days but it means that I put this chance

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,019
to kind of give you an update of what

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,489
we've been thinking about and kind of

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,380
the agenda that we want to set for the

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,900
next few years so the next year's next

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,520
year in the project and you know the

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,049
short and simple summary because I don't

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,549
want to take anyone too much time you

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,960
know it's the last day of the last

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,960
session in the last bit of the

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,619
conference we've been busy we've been

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,659
really busy in fact when we started this

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,030
meeting you know we've been thinking

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,530
along the lines of you know the

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,030
project's been through a whole polar a

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,770
change in the last few years we've done

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,810
leap we've completely revamped

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,990
tumbleweed there's been huge technical

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,780
change in the project and the plan was

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,790
we're going to take it easy this year

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,229
the plan was useless with that's yeah

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,710
it's not going according to plan but

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,000
it's way more exciting as a result but

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,579
that's where we started so we were

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,990
thinking about kind of tidying up what

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,390
things that need tidying up in the

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,490
project there is a fair bit a sort of

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,520
organizational craft lurking around in

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,799
the projects things like wiki articles

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,590
policies procedures old corporate

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,890
statements from the Novell days feature

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,229
requests etc and we've started tidying

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,750
that up over the last few days um so if

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,690
you get a whole pile of emails from fate

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,680
as we've been closing fate entries which

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,600
have already been done in the

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,220
distribution we've been closing feature

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,290
requests that are just never going to

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,420
get done or we think I'm never going to

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,750
get done if we're wrong we open them

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,280
find someone to do them we are going

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,560
through the wiki and tidying up various

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,390
parts there this isn't a job just for us

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,700
and the board if there's things that you

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,880
see that you think why is that there why

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,580
is no one fixed that dive in help tidy

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,440
up you know where we're trying to clean

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,850
all of that croft out of the system kind

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,760
of left lingering around for the last

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,260
few years we've made a start as a fate

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,180
example we actually managed to break

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,820
open fate while doing all this tidy up

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,850
by making too many changes at once so

00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,260
you know that's getting fixed now um but

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,180
yeah so moving along there but that's

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,530
that's going to be an ongoing thing for

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,390
the year and we really want to help

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,950
anybody who's who's moving this if you

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,680
have any questions if you think anything

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,380
needs the board to review just mail

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,930
border openSUSE to org will help you

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,750
tidy it up but while thinking about that

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,799
and actually this this point came from

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,430
from Martin as well you know 42.2 is now

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,709
live 42 degrees in development and 42.1

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,530
went end-of-life a week or two a soda

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,000
and we've noticed already and we've

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,519
we've been a scene for the mailing list

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,100
we've seen to my users that not enough

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,989
uses really a you know followed the

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,090
release cycle that we had planned for

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,090
leap you know there's a lot of people

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,950
still lurking around on 42.1 they didn't

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,790
move to 42 in the six months of they had

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,209
um and really it's kind of obvious why

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,220
we we kept the old terminology from the

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,620
old openSUSE way of doing things where

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,860
we used to have every single version

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,780
being a major version which meant there

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,180
was you know gonna be some risk of

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,090
change when you moved that doesn't

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,070
really make sense for leap every single

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,220
minor release is a minor release it's

00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:13,650
it's based on a sleeve service pack so

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,440
you know we and the the question was

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:19,200
after we kind of decided that with leak

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,720
15 coming next year don't be surprised

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,490
when the messaging side of things we

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,050
start using terms like service pack or

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,100
maintenance pack to refer to those minor

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,870
releases

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,850
and you know we're going to be making

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,670
sure that you know release announcements

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,380
and marketing announcements it'd make it

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,320
much much clearer what that release

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,210
cycle is you know the end of life period

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,740
enough starts from the sack in at the

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,650
end of life period for a previous

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,180
service pack starts the second and you

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,560
service pack is released the six months

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,900
from that point so you know we want to

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,240
help get that message out please help us

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,320
please remind people that a minor

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,270
release is just a service pack really

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,470
another thing we were looking at and I

00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,790
mean anybody who's been in the project

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,610
for more than a year knows we've been

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,350
looking at this is an issue with the the

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,390
membership program so you know obviously

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,910
to elect the board you need to be an

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,130
openSUSE member and currently you know

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,720
to be an openSUSE member you have to

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,270
have you know a bit like a bun tool or

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,010
num had to have been a contributor for a

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,350
while and you know have sustained and

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,060
substantial membership which is a real

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,010
pain in the ass to actually figure out

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,690
if that's true or not you know we have a

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,570
long complicated process of applying

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,870
waiting the tool breaks and accidentally

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,360
loses certain requests and ultimately

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,860
most of the time you know it we're just

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,790
guessing if the person really has

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,320
contributed or not um and also over time

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,670
where even though that you know it does

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,760
eventually work and they do eventually

00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,470
become members it means that it's also

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,200
very hard to unbecoming ember we have

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,600
loads and loads of members on our list

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,310
who don't do anything in the community

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,870
anymore we're 12 years old they've left

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,320
they've moved on fine

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,300
um it means actually that well these

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,940
guys not me I'm different with me but

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,340
these guys are basically uncontrollable

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,650
dictators at this point because they're

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,220
all elected by the community by the you

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,320
know by the membership but the plan in

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,870
the in the the plan in the original

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,300
policies of things is 25 percent of the

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,360
members can cause a recall election of

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,490
the board well right now we can't

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,550
contact 25 percent of the membership on

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,490
the list so you know they have complete

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:33,210
power souza can fire me but they can't

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,700
get rid of them um we the board all of

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,590
us don't like that situation we want to

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,910
be more accountable to the membership of

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,240
the community we want to be convenient

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,190
to the

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,630
munity at large so how do we fix that

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,240
we're going to be changing the situation

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:50,190
so a single contribution to openSUSE is

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,900
enough to be eligible for a member you

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,099
still have to apply for it and want to

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,690
be a member and I'm just going to

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,419
randomly give up membership to anybody

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,639
who's done anything wants but if you

00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,849
have one measurable contribution be that

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,880
um you know an actual thing in a bit of

00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:09,240
code or mailing this post or whatever

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,550
it's enough to become a member the exact

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,620
details in the tooling of you know

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,550
automatic approval or confirmation is a

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,409
work in progress

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,870
you know the covent tool we have we want

00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:20,400
to decommission you know we do have a

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,550
few scripts that are helping us with

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,900
that process but if we you know if you

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,759
want if you're interested in helping us

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,229
with this may how is currently doing

00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,770
most of the work he could do with help

00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,449
you know people helping him we will be

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,360
looking what we will be already using a

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,069
tool to automatically renew membership

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,800
so if you are contributing at least once

00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:44,729
a year this will never affect you you

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,289
remember then fine no problem if however

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,150
for whatever reason you drop off the

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,560
radar from the tools perspective like

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,530
changing your email address for example

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,870
will probably cause that once a year

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,509
this tool will ping you and say hey do

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,560
you still want to be a member the

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,360
principle that we want to keep

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,880
throughout all of this is an open Susan

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,680
member remains a member as long as they

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,419
want to be one so that ping isn't a

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,639
threat to get rid of you

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,380
it's just making sure are you still

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,319
there are you still interested if you

00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,360
are cool fine good done still a member

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,889
at least for another year and then you

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,550
know the bot might be stupid and ask you

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,409
again we'll see but we need help with

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,960
all of that tooling we need help with

00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,659
that and especially as we did a test run

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,069
of the tool while we were here and we

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,219
accidentally deleted 90 people that we

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:34,740
didn't mean to so incredibly sorry about

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,589
that please just email us we'll put your

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,870
membership back yeah you know beta

00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:44,219
testing is always fun sorry

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,100
and yeah that covers the membership side

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,880
of things another thing that was was on

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,190
the agenda for the meeting was handling

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,350
the the rough edges of the project and

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,930
everybody should know from me ranting

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,060
last year on this stage this is an area

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,949
that that's incredibly close to my heart

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,470
of you know what do we do about the

00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:06,300
unsupported parts of openSUSE you know

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,610
what do we do about people using devel

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,640
projects or you know the unofficial

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,320
spins of like Krypton and argon or new

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,890
initiatives like black cubic with it you

00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,779
know there these things are something

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,470
which people want to use they're going

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,459
to use it you know the exciting things

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,410
but they're not that level of quality

00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,820
that we the openSUSE community are

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,620
normally doing things they're not being

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,120
tested by open QA they're not built to

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,579
the standard policies we use in

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,640
tumbleweed or leap or anything like that

00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,690
and how do we handle well when we

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,940
started this we're talking about how do

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,430
we handle the rough edges do we you know

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,860
kill or drop these or whatever but as we

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,600
were discussing this week we realized

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,250
that that isn't actually the question

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,510
that needs to be answered the question

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,220
is sort of how do you handle people's

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,010
expectations of this of these

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,770
technically these bits of the project so

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,890
when they use them they dive in knowing

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,199
this minor this is still openSUSE but it

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,420
might not be finished yet or might not

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:05,100
be totally that same level as the main

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,279
deliverables that the open through the

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,500
project gives so like you can see there

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,360
openSUSE incubators is a program we're

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,640
starting basically ripping off the idea

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,370
entirely from from Apache Apache solve

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,140
this problem you know their own way

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,140
and and from up the way we see it is

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,850
sort of an official stamp of both intent

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,130
and quality you know any openSUSE

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,020
incubator project is an open SUSE er

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,329
project and it's something we're

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,279
actively working on but from a quality

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,350
perspective it's an open SUSE a project

00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,060
that isn't quite yet of that quality but

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,370
it's aspiring to be there it's going to

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,290
be there sooner or later

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,690
the sort of things that we're thinking

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,430
of like I said things like Krypton are

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,160
gone where you know the communities

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,390
there are you know working on testing

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,190
working on improving these things

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,870
they're trying to get there the perfect

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,740
example of the sort of thing which we

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,770
think would make a good

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,900
openSUSE incubator project we want the

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,270
kind of badge to be relatively easy to

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,580
get you know a casual application to the

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,720
board is you know basically the way

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,400
we're thinking of managing it is at

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,990
least to start with and you know we're

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,390
going to ask a few simple questions like

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,130
is it more than one contributor do you

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,410
do you have one or two people doing it

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,420
you know have you thought about testing

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,190
this have you thought about that but

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,170
this isn't going to be any hard

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,630
definitions because these projects might

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,790
not be something that's easy to compare

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,380
to what we're already doing this might

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,839
not be another distribution this could

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,660
be you know something like a spacewalk

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,630
billed for openSUSE which wouldn't fit

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,920
in that same concept so how yeah how do

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,020
we handle that we're not going to make

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
long complicated policies it's not a way

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,170
of doing things

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,120
we'll have this simple process you apply

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,250
we think about it talk it out

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,260
you're an incubator and then we'll make

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,600
it a little bit harder to just like it

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,860
already is to have that isn't a fully

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,410
official openSUSE project where you know

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,120
there'll be there'll be some probably

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,160
still subjective criteria but making

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,930
sure that you know we're using the

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,600
openSUSE name on something that is you

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,330
know polished tested done the proper way

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,650
just like we do everything else and

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:12,690
again with all this stuff we need help

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,400
you know we need to know which project

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,250
would make sense to become these firsts

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,710
you know incubators we need help tidying

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,450
up these processing criteria and of

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,310
course this could potentially have a big

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,510
change on things like the tooling and we

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,910
were thinking about with develop

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,580
projects in particular there's a lot of

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,560
develop projects where they exist purely

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,290
as a development messing around the

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,080
ground to put stuff into tumbleweed you

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:40,080
don't want users touching them ever and

00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,330
if they do the tuna break but there's

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,070
other develop projects like Nome next in

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,170
the KDE unstable ones where they're

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,640
built with users in mind for potentially

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,070
testing and playing around with the

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,960
latest version of the various tax

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,060
and they're tested and they looked after

00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,400
and they're moderated properly they're

00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,900
developed projects still for factory but

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,930
they could also be incubation projects

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,850
too if that happens we're going to want

00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,490
to reflect that in tools like software

00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,830
openSUSE de org so they're treated as a

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,630
different tier of not official but not

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,330
you know do not touch be scared

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,800
unsupported nonsense so we'll need help

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,860
reflecting that in the tooling and the

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,110
websites etc and so you know we haven't

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,700
put anything on opens user project yet

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,560
but you know we we're low if someone

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,390
wants to start the discussion straight

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,200
after this start on the mailing list

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:31,230
we'll talk about it job done nearly

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,270
nearly there next year

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,820
openSUSE conference we've been thinking

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,250
about that um you know hope we've

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,080
already said everybody had a good time

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,710
we love coming here it's been as much

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,970
fun this year as it was last but we're

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:49,170
thinking for next year doing something

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:51,060
slightly different you know mainly

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,810
thinking the idea of colo Cote

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,430
co-locating with a different event and

00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,140
obviously you know we're close to Prague

00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,640
there's lots of contributors we have in

00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,840
Prague there's another Suzhou office in

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,840
Prague which makes it easy for the

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,350
budgeting side of things so we're

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,000
thinking of taking openSUSE 2018 to

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,130
Prague the University they have their

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,750
co-locating with the the crypto theft

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,030
which conveniently happens about the

00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,970
same time this time next year

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,680
nothing's absolutely certain yet um you

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,690
know if it doesn't work out plan B is to

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,270
to come back to to here and do another

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,460
openSUSE conference in nürnberg and even

00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,770
if this happens I the board's thinking

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,330
of having a model of one year having the

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,460
conference in Prague and trying to

00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,320
co-locate with something there and every

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,390
other year coming back here having

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,170
openSUSE here because it works we love

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:45,600
it it's been great and then last but

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:47,550
nobody's least mission statements we had

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,190
a long long discussion about the

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,660
openSUSE mission statement um first

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,940
because we were thinking of tidying

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,190
stuff up like why do we even have one

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,070
you know other projects done fedora do

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:03,480
but like Debian don't and don't have

00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,640
this but we decided that we think it

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,190
matters it sets the tone of the project

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,650
or more actually reflects a tone of the

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,110
project and is the first thing that

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,570
everybody quotes when they say what is

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,070
openSUSE you can just look at it

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,230
especially in a few years where we've

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,730
been getting a lot more media attention

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,100
the openSUSE mission statement gets

00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,860
cited in every single mention of us in

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,870
conference webpages in news articles all

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,600
the time it's the first thing a newcomer

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,410
is likely to read and our mission

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,610
statement currently reads this openSUSE

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,650
is a worldwide effort that promotes the

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,260
use of Linux everywhere and it was

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:44,040
that's what we started doing twelve

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,410
years ago then we started looking at ok

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,250
what do we actually do in openSUSE

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,220
and I mean this is just a tiny example

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:56,220
these are all the openSUSE sub projects

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,870
you've got testing tools you've got that

00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,700
huge collection of different things

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,260
which are all openSUSE in their own way

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,430
and they're not necessarily linux so

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,130
should the mission statement have been

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,620
something like this you know a worldwide

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,900
project that you know promoting use of

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,050
Linux and build tools and testing tools

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,320
and system tools and software delivery

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,690
tools and collaboration tools everywhere

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,310
no um

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,920
and while we were talking this out we

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,700
kind of realized that that both

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,430
especially this one but even the

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,550
original one misses the whole point of

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,290
what's actually special with openSUSE

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,230
because it's not just about what are we

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,630
doing but how we're actually doing it

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,550
and some of the things that really said

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,070
openSUSE apart from everything else is

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,770
the fact as a community we really care

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,690
about working openly having not just

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,480
open source but open discussions

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,040
different ideas you know I'm entire

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,600
develop project model is built to look

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,770
on the idea of we're going to have

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,390
different teams working in different

00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,820
ways so let's find a way of cramming

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,620
that all into Factory it's just the way

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,630
we think having open processes in

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,470
everything but even though we do

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,050
everything openly

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,360
we worry about doing things right in the

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,189
first place half of those tools exist

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,260
because we care about engineering links

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,430
properly we care about doing it the

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,080
right way we care about Bill

00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,910
reproducibly in the build service we

00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,310
care about testing that stuff properly

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,350
and our cover mission statement just

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,250
kind of ignores all of that and doesn't

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,480
even mention it

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,920
and we also really embrace the

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,860
traditional open source way of

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,230
scratching your own itch nobody sets the

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,630
agenda for openSUSE more than the

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,880
community does when they're doing it you

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,500
know we are open you know you set it

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,950
well we set it there's no difference

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,160
it's one consistent mass of everybody

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,740
doing whatever they want to do and how

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,000
do you really sort of reflect that when

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,030
we're trying to set mission statements

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,860
of what the community does so I mean

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,150
this isn't final then basically I'm

00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,860
going to have to write order this up in

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,270
his explanation way better because I

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,670
haven't had the time rather being at the

00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,050
conference but you know we're going to

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,900
be talking on the mailing list about

00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:10,110
this new draft of redefining the mission

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,910
statement as openSUSE openly engineered

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,610
tools to change your world you know

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,540
basically really focus on all those main

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,770
aspects of we do everything in the open

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,650
how we engineer stuff really really

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,930
matters the use case of why what are we

00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,120
doing it for is whatever our community

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,430
wants to do it for it's your itch it's

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,870
your things you want to change and of

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,450
course ultimately everything we're

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,760
building is a tool in some form be it

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,440
the build service which is more open QA

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
which are obviously one but the

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,650
distributions themselves ultimately

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,730
they're useless if they're not doing

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:46,880
something they're tools and that is the

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,260
last thing I have on these slides so

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,410
with that does anybody have any

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:57,570
questions about this or anything else in

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:59,990
the project or does everybody just want

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:04,010
to go and have beer

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:08,240
and just shown just yeah just for the

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:10,730
missions that I would say when we talk

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,740
about community it's a community of

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:19,310
human and not a community of tools zan

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,620
perhaps we have to find a way to put

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:26,960
somewhere here inside the sentence human

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,640
but but the human part is the your you

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,020
know we're not making this for robotic

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,460
AI yet okay but you it's a fair point we

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,750
did discuss that we actually went round

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,790
and round in circles and tried to figure

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,010
out how to put a human message in there

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,160
but we we thought the your world part

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,990
did that but it's a fair point when we

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,030
put this on the project mailing list I

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,160
fully expect a really long mailing list

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:52,040
right don't be surprised about it this

00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:56,000
is just a draft it says draft but this

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,560
is what we were thinking about cool okay

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,280
then yeah

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,020
oh no Christian he's going tools and

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,520
processes perhaps because I think it's

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,650
equally important to make an open tool

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,770
in an open way I think you have that

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,420
openly but process is it's like a bigger

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,970
word that would wrap many of those

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,380
concepts now I can barely hear a word

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,020
you're saying cuz I'm sorry because

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,760
sorry anyway just wanted to say maybe

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,030
processes as well as tools because I

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,860
think does you're equally important

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,720
processes instead of tools yeah um yeah

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,820
totally I mean the openly part was kind

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,530
of meant to imply that but trying to fit

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,350
all this stuff into sentences is killer

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,860
but yeah we're working on that one

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,180
it yeah I like the new statement just

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,150
surprised because I thought we just

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,550
changed it two years ago to the makers

00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,500
choice nobody mentioned now they that

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,530
was a marketing tagline that wasn't our

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:52,430
mission statement okay yeah and yeah

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:54,500
that's this this all of this stuff that

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,330
we've explained here or explain there

00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,770
you know in our mission statement we

00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,180
have like paragraph explaining what

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,590
we're trying to mean behind that and

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,660
that's that's what the whole mission

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,340
statement will do in full that's just

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:08,090
the short simple part

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,130
hi mark I just want to say I like your

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,570
mission statement usually usually when

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,960
people get together admit to have a

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,190
mission statement

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,200
the number of people on the committee

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,490
multiply it by like eight and that's how

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,830
many words are in your written statement

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,539
so I think I think you guys have done a

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,970
really good job training that isn't a

00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,409
mulch hopefully Thomas is he deserves

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,270
all the praise for that because our

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,320
vision aversion was like that long it

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,240
was terrible and then he got this

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,950
clipboard out he's like start voting on

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,380
these life or we're gonna kill him and

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,559
we got down to this tank well thanks to

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,510
Thomas I just want to bring up a topic

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,750
that we're working on with Lennox

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:45,120
magazine we're going to try to get a

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,880
magazine out called getting started with

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,169
Lennox and so we were going to have them

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,419
work on that for 42.3 and we need some

00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:58,320
articles so if any of you are interested

00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:03,450
in writing something specific about 42.3

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:06,270
for a magazine contact me cool great

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,159
thank you okay then thanks a lot for a

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,640
great conference and yeah see you all

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,740
next year

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:21,570
hopefully in Prague oh sorry what do you

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:28,740
want just a quick check who is aware of

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:30,539
the tsp I just want to make sure okay

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,899
more okay maybe I should rephrase the

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:35,570
question

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:35,570
who's not aware of what the TSP is

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:43,169
perfect you can explain it right so

00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:47,070
openSUSE have what's known as the Travel

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:50,270
Support Program hence TSP because we're

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:55,190
in technology so we like acronyms and

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:59,039
the aim of the TSP is to enable

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:06,059
community members to represent the

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:08,909
project at other events at venues etc so

00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:14,940
if you would like to attend a conference

00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:20,279
or some other event but it's not

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:22,200
necessarily pocket change so it's not

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:26,260
just ten years to get on the train or

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:33,850
whatever you can submit request to

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:38,230
TSP the current and foreseeable deal is

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:42,310
that the TSP will pay up to 80 percent

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:45,730
of your travel and accommodation we do

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:51,520
check to make sure that you can get

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:55,480
potentially cheaper flights but it's

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,650
fairly easy to apply for so just make

00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,250
sure that when you do submit a request

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:06,880
currently it's through kynect but that's

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:11,230
not a major issue we'll just be moved to

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,720
a different piece but if you go via the

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:17,290
wiki if you just search for openSUSE TSP

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,150
or ropes is a travel support you'll

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:23,140
easily find it hopefully we can have a

00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,910
an easier URL to remember but I just

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,370
want to make sure that if you are

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,340
interested in representing openSUSE in

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:33,070
whatever shape or form and you'd like

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,840
help to do that please do submit a

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:41,200
request if we've got any questions we'll

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,610
get straight back to TSP will just

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,520
confirm with the board to make sure that

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:48,940
everyone's happy with that

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,370
chances are actually I don't know any

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,500
reason in the past at the board of

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:58,900
complained I know one putting my putting

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,770
my other hat on for a second as a sues

00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,090
the chairman the protocol for Susy

00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,910
employees you happen to be contributing

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:10,660
and there's a few of you in the room is

00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:13,660
is subtly different the TSP is you know

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,400
is there to help but Sousa wants to make

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,140
sure that Sousa is paying for Sousa

00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,910
first before making the community pay

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,000
for anything

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:24,090
so the TSP is only available for Sousa

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
employees who also contributed openSUSE

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:30,190
once your manager has already said no

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,570
and as long as you're actively

00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,760
contributing to the event in question

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,310
like doing a talk about openSUSE there

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,870
so you know it's still there for you but

00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,640
really try and get your manager to pay

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,970
for it first and Sousa should be paying

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,130
that

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,820
so that's the only time I can think of

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,960
we've ever said no so that's all does

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:52,300
anybody have anything else they want to

00:25:46,960 --> 00:26:00,520
talk about any questions you guys any

00:25:52,300 --> 00:26:02,140
complaints no if that was true the

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,800
project mailing list would be so much

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:16,819
quieter alright then thank you very much

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:16,819
