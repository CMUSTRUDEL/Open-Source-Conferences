Summary of the last year

A tour on what's new in the YaST world, all the way from the high level
view down to some interesting technical details. The talk includes an
introduction to quite some new cool stuff and a review on what is being
dropped or improved. There will also be an open discussion on how
several features implemented in YaST to support SLE can open new
possibilities for openSUSE.
