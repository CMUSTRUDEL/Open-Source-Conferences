Summary of the last year

A tour on what's new in the YaST world, all the way from the high level
view down to some interesting technical details. The talk includes an
introduction to quite some new cool stuff and a review on what is being
dropped or improved. There will also be an open discussion on how
several features implemented in YaST to support SLE can open new
possibilities for openSUSE.

	00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:16,250
okay so looks like it's time so let me

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,500
start it uh and

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:23,630
presentation I would like to give you a

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,160
quick interaction what happens in s in

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:32,270
the last year from more from user

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:37,010
perspective a lot of changes inside but

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:40,730
what's what's visible so will be content

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:45,890
of this presentation is a bit talking

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:49,040
about usability changes there are some

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,200
changes in how we manipulate config

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,290
files and what's the benefits for users

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,210
there's of course new features so also

00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:01,309
some new bugs and there is in reworking

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,229
a new storage stack it's not yet

00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:10,610
deployed anywhere so it's just it's not

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:14,210
possible to see it yet so guarding

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:18,110
usability we try quite a lot on

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:23,060
improving error reporting basically when

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:27,229
something goes wrong and if you get some

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:30,080
useless error that say nothing then yeah

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:32,930
usually customers are our users and

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,330
happy they would like to know some

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,159
details what's going wrong how they can

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:43,250
improve it so few examples would we

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,869
allows in what would we improves in this

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:50,960
era is when there is a non-blocking

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,250
installation error which currently is

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,680
just in a red line

00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:01,970
red red color in installation summary we

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,009
now also erase a pop-up and it have two

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,799
benefits first is that it's very visible

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,649
that it's not just warning it's non

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,260
blocking our so it means if you are

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,030
really really sure you can try to do

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,940
installation but there's high

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,340
probability it will fail and second

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,970
advantage is that it's easily catchable

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,770
about by open QA so open gray when they

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,709
see some strange pop-up start

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,880
complaining I don't like it and that's

00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:35,020
not how it should look like

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,080
another improvement is you can pass a

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:42,410
registration URL at installation command

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,760
line it's mainly interesting for Slee

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:52,400
users but we plan to allow this also for

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:56,510
other URLs URLs is if you in past if you

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,270
write it wrong it will just raise error

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,170
there's wrong URL and you have to start

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,480
from scratch installation it's quite

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:08,600
currently a pop-up showing that the the

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,209
URL is wrong and it allows you to write

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:16,760
it correctly from install so you can

00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:20,720
just continue also we improve checking

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,150
for mandatory installation packages for

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,060
example how it works for a boot loader

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,910
you need to grab two package on target

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,270
system otherwise you have a problem when

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:35,720
you upgrade Karno so boot over say to

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:38,120
software proposal we would like to have

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,100
here grab two and some other packages

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:47,510
but users what users can do is that they

00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:50,090
can open so I proposal I say yeah I

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,330
don't like grab too so so dis selecting

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:58,250
it and problem with this approach is

00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:00,470
that of course we allow it but boot

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,650
loader won't work as you expect because

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,290
it cannot be installed so what happens

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,320
now is that it's a non-blocking error

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,030
which says those mandatory packages did

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,310
we need and if you proceed

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:19,609
probably some parts of your system won't

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:23,540
work as you expected another quite nice

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:27,680
feature is recovery when there is a

00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:32,690
broken below the configuration how it

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,840
can happen a for example if your disk

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,010
crash and you have a backup so you

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,670
restore a backup to different disk and

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:46,460
somehow boot machine for example wire

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:51,320
which of option boot boot system from

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,910
disk then you start boot loader last

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,680
module and it will report

00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,920
we should boot from disk that I that I

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,050
don't know because we use UF ID is the

00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,980
some idea of disk and that's different

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,640
this so it complain that it cannot boot

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,250
and what's happen out it reports

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,550
something is wrong configuration is

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,380
broken and you have a button to propose

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,300
it from scratch so we just say ok

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,630
propose me from scratch and it propose

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,510
working solution you you confirm it and

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:32,210
you have gained working boot loader as

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:35,630
you expected yeah and last but not least

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,200
slightly expert topic I'm not sure how

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:42,050
much of you try to boot via Sarah

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,760
console but its parameters are quite

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,460
tricky because there is something like

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,830
speed of that console device inside

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:54,200
stuff and in past if you write it wrong

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,760
it just report you you write wrong

00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,920
parameters so currently it will also

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,100
write you a health text how the

00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,110
parameters should look like and explain

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,750
each part and also it's explaining in

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,120
the help currently in better way so also

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,880
if you are not familiar web server

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,940
console it will helps you to configure

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,900
it and of course I would like to thanks

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:24,860
to our usability team in yes in Suzanne

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,530
which we often discuss these issues and

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,500
they proposed some some solution that

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,150
doesn't look that's more from user

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:40,750
perspective and not so much from

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:40,750
developer one one

00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:52,689
yeah okay another usability improvement

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:55,719
is that we get a report that half a gig

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:59,889
is no longer enough for installation of

00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:01,809
openSUSE and there is some requirements

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,949
because currently you you install two

00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:10,299
virtual machines and site staff so we

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:14,469
should reduce a footprint so what we did

00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:17,829
is that we analyzed a usage of memory in

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:21,099
installation and reduce it but I would

00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:23,289
like to give here a slight warning that

00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:26,739
it really depends on number of your

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:30,189
online a posters be because we still fit

00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:34,149
only roughly so there is a very small

00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:36,610
space of memory that that that keeps

00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:39,039
there so if you have a lot of online

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,489
memories during installation you it

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:48,489
usually exceed that amount of memory you

00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:50,919
should fit into it yeah and another

00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:54,519
usability improvement is that we get

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:58,689
some report from I think it's student on

00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:02,379
your Oct that have problems with yeah

00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:06,429
problem with ice so so need a high

00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:10,659
contrast high contrast theme from

00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:14,079
installation so we did some analysis we

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:16,599
also in the end contact some some

00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:22,029
researcher on University about the

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:24,159
various low visions problems and what

00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:28,269
what we have now is that we add another

00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:32,740
three themes to installation that allows

00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:36,459
for various problems different themes so

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:41,680
it's visible more visible but it's

00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:45,309
people okay another part is how we

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,240
assess configuration files just quick

00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:52,360
inter the two CFA just config files API

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,990
which is a framework

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,070
abuse reduce a layer

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,680
so it starts to separate reading content

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:07,270
parsing content and then high-level

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:12,400
assessing it the advantage of old

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:16,000
solution is there is a precise command

00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,820
manipulation so it means not just not

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,060
any comment should be removed but also

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,970
if you just wants to add some smart

00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,790
comments like do not touch this it's

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:35,050
it's configured biased it's now possible

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:39,520
and reduce quite a lot of gasps lenses

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,160
so it means we don't need a write open

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,920
parsers usually if I've got support it

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,950
it's we can just use what's already

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,870
existing and other advantages that we

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,770
contributing to obvious upstream we

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:55,990
already fix one or two stuff there and

00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:00,940
improve some lenses and then some parts

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:04,740
doesn't fit now one example is in NTP V

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,140
for example allowing new syntax for ipv6

00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:12,100
restriction and we we of course send it

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:17,260
to upstream so even not just there's

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:21,340
benefits from this change what we

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,710
improve in this config files API in last

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,500
year is that we try to do a smarter

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:30,990
writing previously the parser creates

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,780
some tree and we create some internal

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,090
internal representation of this tree

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,600
money played with it and then write it a

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:44,230
hole back so it means in all gasp

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,590
everything is marked as dirty still it

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,410
no comments will be removed but some

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:54,310
white spaces some formatting will be

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:57,580
removed because algis tries to keep it

00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:02,890
only if the element is untouched if you

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:07,690
modify it it will also write it somehow

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:09,250
from from scratch so what we do is now

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,270
that we in

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:19,600
our internal tree also keep these flags

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:22,450
if stuff is modified add remove and then

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,660
we applied to using our gas oven

00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:29,050
operations so there's stuff like remove

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,900
it add something or just modify and that

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:36,150
allows us to do more smarter edit ation

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:40,570
and Indian a diff is very small and

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:46,930
early edits only part that just needs

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:54,000
the rest of your file is untouched yeah

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:58,300
and also we try to optimize it there's a

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,300
with old box that ett hosts have more

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:08,050
than ten thousands lines of config the

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,420
the the real usage is that they use some

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,870
kind of software that do some kind of

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,020
blocking by writing stuff to et Cie host

00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:22,200
and in the end their blacklist is so big

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:27,000
that it's so many so many lines with

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:32,920
sending host to some some blocking

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,940
gateway so we try it with CFA this old

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,910
buck if it helps and as you can see

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,980
lower in measurement it's around two

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,940
times faster but we think it's not

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:52,600
enough and it's time to at least learn

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,800
to play with a proba profiler which

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,710
trailer really works it's something like

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,810
I think it's comparable to for example

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:07,900
sim profilers and we optimized it by

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,240
some some caching when we analyze output

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,500
we analyze it and result is that it's

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,620
again two times faster so just with

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:20,770
using a different parser and with

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,840
optimizing it result is that previously

00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,650
asked opens or

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,720
for more than one minute and now it's 20

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,380
seconds which is still far from perfect

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:36,850
but yeah it's early book a really big

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,950
file and I'm not so sure that August is

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:43,840
the the correct tool to edit file they'd

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:51,210
have 10,000 lines because yeah it's

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:54,850
Arabic yeah and we still increasing

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,560
usage of that CFA Angela it was

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,960
introduced for bootloader which of

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:04,960
various formats and now use it also as I

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,680
mentioned for ITC host also from NTP as

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:13,300
I mentioned we found there is back in

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:17,380
all gasp lens that prevent parsing a new

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:23,710
ipv6 option so we also fix it use it for

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:27,370
modifying zip configuration also if you

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:29,950
see the emos presentation at this

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,030
morning we are now somehow configuring

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,120
puppet and salt

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:46,330
so we also using it for these new parts

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:49,210
of just okay so new features yeah it

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,000
depends how much you are partnering but

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,860
there is something like trusted booting

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,750
that the verifies integrity of whole

00:14:53,860 --> 00:15:03,880
system from very start so for aggressive

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:08,950
booting it's starts at BIOS for newer it

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:11,410
should start on efi but just and also

00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:15,010
installation and a whole open search

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:19,300
that doesn't have support yet for efi so

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:23,830
that's one of a new feature that there

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:29,920
is a new software that's it's called TPM

00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:32,200
two and it allows booting for efi yeah

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,180
the set part that they create a new

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,700
software and they just drop a legacy

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,510
booting so we would like

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:42,880
- soup support both of it so result is

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,720
that in UI it looks like just one check

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:51,070
box I won't trust it booting but in

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,980
McCann it's two different software and

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,940
slightly different configuration yeah

00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:00,610
but in UI it looks like it's same and

00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,790
now we support plastic booting also on

00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:07,300
EFI yeah

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:10,440
another part is castle and CUDA Kubik if

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,540
you see a presentation yesterday it's

00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:18,130
some orchestration its platform for

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,230
container orchestration but adaptation

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,960
in us is mainly that we created

00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,930
simplified installer maybe you see

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,720
yesterday it's just one-click installer

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:32,800
and that's a lot of adaptations to

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,180
really have small and install and also

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:41,650
to allow this to be done automatically

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:45,190
way so that's how this simplifies

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,740
installation looks like as you can see

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,230
the only mandatory part is a password

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,320
for root and the confirmation of

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,250
password yet because we don't want to

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,440
profile it prepare fill it for you but

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,380
other parts are are automatically

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,540
proposed for example NTP servers are

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:10,120
obtained by SLP discovery and the rest

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,620
is just proposed and you can click

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,620
install and it will work

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,300
yeah one different feature for openSUSE

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:25,420
is if you use sample which you maybe

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:31,780
noticed in installation this new desktop

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:34,330
selection now it still the first first

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,550
draft there is still in do some

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:41,320
improvements this part but let me

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,090
introduce why why we did it because

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,720
there is also some controversy about it

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:50,260
like why there is not enlightenment xfce

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,660
and whatever the scope you like

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:57,280
and in fact that's the exact reason

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:59,650
there's now so many Forks and attempts

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,180
to write on desktop solution and

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,880
everyone would like to have it in

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:06,430
installer and think that others are yeah

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,150
a second citizen so we should replace

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:15,030
this not so so active desktop with our

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:20,290
desktop and so on and yes team don't

00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:22,900
want to maintain it such list and also

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,180
don't want to make these decisions

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,100
because yeah it's always yeah it's

00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:32,650
something like flame you cannot win so

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,070
what's the what's the result is this

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,860
simple simple dialogue that allows KD in

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,990
and know which we still see us a major

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,820
ones they'd use a majority of new users

00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,610
there is server for a quick installation

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,910
of text mode and then there is a custom

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,910
and custom opens a patterns selector and

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:03,970
so it means that any new desktop only

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:07,930
thing that they need to do is have a its

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,300
pattern in in depository they maintain

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,590
this pattern they decide what what's

00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:19,330
used us login manager and site stuff

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,550
because everything is in pattern and one

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,930
more advantage is that on this same

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,630
screen you can configure online

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:31,000
repositories so it means that for

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:34,540
example if leap is least half a year ago

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,210
and there is a new cool desktop that you

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:41,680
would like to have in this older leap

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:45,220
you can just send it to update

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:47,080
repository and then if you installed

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,930
with network you have this update

00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,420
repository and the patterns that will be

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:55,420
also in updater poster is shown in this

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,750
custom so in fact you can install a

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,980
desktop that's not yet available when

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,980
the DVDs are released

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:12,820
yeah that's more like for developers but

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,429
you can maybe also notice it because we

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,519
integrate debugger Ruby debugger and

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:21,070
profiler it can be start by a common

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,980
environment variables that you just

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,710
define it and it the dress stuck in the

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:32,109
bugger and profile but how you can see

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:36,639
it is if just somehow crashes especially

00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:39,220
in installation then it show pop-ups and

00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:42,399
in this pop-up you can click on the

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,700
button that you would like to debug this

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:48,309
issue and it wit it will show the Ruby

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,820
debugger and you can play with it so not

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:55,600
so much for end-users but very useful

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:59,350
for ya developers to see what's exactly

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:02,950
going wrong and for example even users

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:07,419
can can go to to this debugger and try

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:09,970
something some commands that's suggested

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,879
by the purpose if it's array one machine

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:16,080
problem you cannot reproduce it then you

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:18,909
have full environment or the bugging so

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,720
it also helps us with some cooperation

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:25,629
and something goes wrong yeah

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,700
as I mentioned it's on system on an

00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:29,649
installation by default the dependence

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,720
is not installed on system so if you

00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:35,529
have just on system that the debugger is

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,279
not there but in installation it's part

00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:47,460
of a installation system so it's always

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:52,629
there and if you are not native speakers

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:56,080
English native speakers it can also

00:21:52,629 --> 00:22:00,700
maybe helps you that just switch to open

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:05,259
to set applied as URL I tried before

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:07,539
this presentation and I have to say I'm

00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:10,269
quite impressed because in past I try

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:14,139
some transition using VI which is yeah

00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:16,419
cool and hack away but this web UI

00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:18,340
earlier helps with some associate

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:22,480
for example you translate some string

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,940
and gives you ten different strings

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,139
that's translated that contains similar

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,659
words so you have some idea how its

00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:35,679
translated at at other parts and it

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:38,169
helps you have consistent translation so

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,960
just using this verb late for

00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:44,619
translating now and I encourage anyone

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:49,210
to just try it and see if maybe you can

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:51,009
improve yeah not just just translation

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:55,090
but there's also other projects that's

00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:58,049
in openSUSE you can help your colleagues

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:01,330
that don't speak English

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:04,869
yeah and we have new model for

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:08,669
alternatives it's a result of google

00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:12,249
Summer of Code it was implemented by

00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:18,820
Hakim which was a google Summer of Code

00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:23,129
student and you can met him last year

00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,129
because he was here at conference and

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:29,049
yeah if you don't know what's out on

00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:31,119
others just quickly it's a system how we

00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:33,730
can switch implementation if there's

00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,759
several Forks of some projects you can

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,929
easily switch between them it's used for

00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:43,149
example for a wiki you can I think it's

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,919
also heavily used by Java to switch if

00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:49,149
you have multiple other environments

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:51,100
what's default one yeah and there's a

00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:54,879
south integration into auto installation

00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,440
and also experimental puppet that's if

00:23:54,879 --> 00:24:01,169
you are interested into it I always

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:06,340
suggest to see a video for morning talk

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:11,649
that was made by emo yeah and there's a

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:16,539
new storage stack which is yeah some

00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:19,899
summary design of storage code it's yet

00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:23,799
every parts is touch it allows new

00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:27,159
features because yeah the hardware

00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:29,259
vendors are so crazy allows new fancy

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,190
hardware they'd have various support

00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:34,509
also Karen

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:38,320
eyes add crazy features to btrfs and we

00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:42,700
need to somehow support it so you will

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:46,240
see it and thus here at two o'clock

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:51,610
Arvind will present about it so I would

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,610
like to invite everyone to see this talk

00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:57,970
if you are interested so summer friends
