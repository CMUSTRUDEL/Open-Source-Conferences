Bring your application to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source project for orchestrating containerized applications.
But how to containerize your workload? How to bring your containerized application into Kubernetes?

This talk will show how we transferred our application to Kubernetes.
- This includes containerizing the application (based on an openSUSE docker image)
- How to expose your application services via Kubernetes.
- How to create a shared file system for all Pod belonging to your application via Kubernetes.

I will show how to do that plus a demo on a running Kubernetes System provided by SUSE CaaS
