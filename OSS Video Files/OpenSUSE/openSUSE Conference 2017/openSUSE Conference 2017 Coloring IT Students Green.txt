SUSE Academic Program explained

The new SUSE Academic Program explained!
As a leading open source company, SUSE supports schools, higher learning institutions and the academic community in getting free access to our extensive experience and knowledge.
Many IT-students still get trained in software stacks that are not the highest in demand by the labor market. In many cases IT-infrastructure classes are still dominated by proprietary software, but the dominating IT-infrastructure "in real life" nowadays is open source technology.
As SUSE delivers enterprise open source technology many schools have asked SUSE to come with a academic program now we are able to explain you most bits and bites of how we believe we can color schools and students green!

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:57,539
why Susan came up with an academic

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,129
program after that we'll talk through

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,050
the academic program the new Susie

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,379
academic program what does it mean what

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:09,270
is it contain the different levels that

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:12,120
are built into the new program and at

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,210
the end I've got a real call for action

00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:19,590

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:24,690
um and then Q&A at the end but as I said

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:27,870
please interrupt at any time so um why

00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:31,140
me um I've been working now for Susie

00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:33,660
for two years and I am responsible and

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,430
getting paid to have hello somebody's

00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,600
waving do you want me to stay over there

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:45,420
okay so oh I have to stay in this books

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,770
alright I'll try um so professionally

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,630
I'm working for Susan and I'm

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,290
responsible for the commercial training

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,000
program I'm managing all the training

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,980
partners in Europe Middle East and

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,040
Africa and that is quite successful and

00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,650
at that time when I started with

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,710
managing and setting up a program to get

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,780
as many people as possible trained in

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,510
Susan we realized that we were

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,670
forgetting the students but it was just

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,530
a matter of we can do only one thing at

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,569
a time so now two years later the whole

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,430
commercial program for commercial

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,069
training institutes is working quite

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,030
well in Europe Middle East and Africa so

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:32,170
now it is time to

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:36,520
come up with a academic program coming

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,940
from the corporate company Susan my

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,310
background as I said I'm working for two

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,430
years for Susan but before that I worked

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,410
for ten years for a Linux consultancy

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,830
and training company in the Netherlands

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,440
and I am the founder of LPI together

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:58,300
with other open-source ambassadors in

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,640
the Netherlands and Belgium so I've been

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:06,610
working on getting students to work with

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:09,910
Linux for many years and as I said now

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:12,940
the chameleon came into my life and I'm

00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,010
quite active on social media so if you

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,560
like to say something about this talk

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:24,100
then look at hashtag Kiko Ventura I'm

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,430
active on the most platform so if you

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,620
want to have anything to share please do

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:37,630
so and looking forward to your feedback

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:41,440
so now to the academic program um I have

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:45,820
been trying to get universities of

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,130
Applied Science different IT schools to

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,750
work with Linux and open source in

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,450
general for many years and when I

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,780
started about 12 years ago now I was

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,380
quite armed shouting in the desert it

00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,780
was just me and when I was talking to

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,570
many University of Applied Science it

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,140
was quite often that there was not much

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,910
response because at that time the

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,880
classes were just dominated by

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,380
proprietary software solutions and at

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,000
that time there were some reasons why it

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,770
should be and focused on the proprietary

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,770
solutions but the world has changed and

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,450
when you're going to lobby try to get

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,210
people enthusiastic and IT instructors

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,750
to be enthusiastic about training in

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,610
Linux training and open-source it is

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,530
important that you make differentiation

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,870
what you focus on

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,950
last year at this conference that it

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:51,520
took on many recommendations how you can

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:54,310
get your school to work with Linux and

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,870
open source and one of the

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,850
recommendation I had this make sure that

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,800
you are clear what you're talking about

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:05,430
in this case I try to be clear the souza

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,750
academic program that's been released

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:16,930
fits very well to the curriculum so what

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:20,410
are the IT teachers training and also on

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,170
operations the desktop is not that

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:26,410
dominant in the academic program you can

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:29,740
use it but um actually yesterday here I

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:32,050
learned that there is a sort of openSUSE

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,050
academic program being set up but that's

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,330
very early stage so I expect you will

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,210
hear about hear more about it in the

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,760
next months and probably next year here

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,730
at Susan at openSUSE conf there will be

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,400
a talk on the open

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,660
openSUSE academic program but now we

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,680
focus on operations and on curriculum

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,000
it's quite difficult for me to stay

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,220
inside this box

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,060
do I really have the stake and I not do

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:04,480
know

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:06,490
oh I'm told to be here so why isn't

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,290
important why is it important to have an

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,570
ethnic acronym

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:14,860
hello academic program at all why is

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:20,440
that important it's um important that

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:23,110
the schools are bring people to the to

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,830
the labor market that actually fit the

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,920
profile so if you look at open source

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,590
technology a couple of years ago we did

00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,370
a navigate investigation a true survey

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,250
in the Netherlands and we investigated

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,850
how was the connection between the

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:46,990
number of open source people finishing

00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,630
university compared to the demand in the

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,250
labor market and what we found there is

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,410
what we've defined as the open

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,700
generation gap so the open generation

00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,500
gap is the

00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,340
difference between what the labor market

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,280
wants compared to the number of students

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,550
finishing in the technology of Linux and

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,170
when I say Linux I am talking about more

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,750
wider than just Linux because I think

00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,750
open-source technology in totally is

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,700
important but that's the open generation

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,190
gap and the open generation gap was

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,140
there in the Netherlands and because

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,770
I've been working for LPI which is a

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,360
global organization I'm quite have the

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,170
guts to say that it was a worldwide

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:34,030
challenge at that time anybody in the

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:37,210
room here today who is an IT teacher yes

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,270
one a couple of IT teachers all right

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:46,990
and you're obviously because you here

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:52,090
your training Linux to students computer

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,170
science ok methodologies yes all right

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,730
excellent excellent

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,950
and you've been doing that for many many

00:07:54,730 --> 00:08:00,250
years for three years three years okay

00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:03,790
and why is it now since three years that

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:07,030
you're now training into Linux

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,670
technology and before that not no one

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,930
else was doing it before and but there

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:16,180
was a demand there there is an

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,370
misunderstood demand the the students

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:21,160
don't know they only know what their

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,800
teachers tell them and the existing

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,590
faculty didn't like you said there was a

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,740
generation gap they've grown up in a

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,650
different non open source environment so

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,630
they don't know how to teach it and so

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,010
there needs to be a bridge that comes

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,590
across there and I'm trying to help

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,450
bridge that gap fantastic keep on the

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:45,190
good work and we might have something

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:48,150
for you for your students so that's the

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,330
academic program in total and that's for

00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,820
Linux independent technology so whatever

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:57,190
distribution as long as it's Linux I'm

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,190
fine with that but as I'm working for

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,540
Susan and I think openSUSE and Celeste

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:06,600
are fantastic distributions he

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:11,009
you have to teach students Linux why not

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,050
do it in Susy technology anybody another

00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:18,060
argument for not doing it in Susy

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:19,560
technology well if you would have asked

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,769
me three years ago I would have said I

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,630
don't really mind if it's Susie or any

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:28,290
of the other distribution I think Debian

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,230
to be honest it's quite a important

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,750
distribution as well so yeah I like

00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,360
Susie a lot and I love the geek oh I

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,949
traveled around with him anywhere or her

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,350
it's actually not known even to him or

00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:45,180
her but it is important that different

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,160
distributions are being taught as long

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,589
as the market demands several I say that

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,560
distribution knowledge so knowledge in a

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,420
different distribution why not have the

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,899
University of Applied Science also

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,779
teaching the different technologies

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,810
anybody disagree with me please do so

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,940
now okay so we all like Sousa and we all

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,190
like and understand that other

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,670
distributions are important as well okay

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:19,230
so now Sousa came with an academic

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:22,079
program um anybody an ID why is by

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:27,510
Susie's interested in coming up with an

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:30,690
academic program potential employees

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,980
yeah absolutely that's a very very good

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,740
reason actually because we've got more

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,139
than hundred vacancies at the moment at

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,540
Sousa so if you're into Sousa technology

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,790
and you like to work for us

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,610
have a look at the jobs we have so

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,089
absolutely for our own reason to have

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:53,220
more people knowing about Susan so arm

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:57,319
they will probably easier apply for a

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,319
job with us so absolutely another reason

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,520
lowers

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,930
here's two markets can you explain a

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,480
little bit about saying that because I'm

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,480
looking into a lamp over there hey Doug

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,520
it basically gets people a knowledgeable

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,470
of open source and early age and of

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,540
course as they go in and they become

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,330
managers or things that nature they're

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,380
familiar with it it's it just it's a

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:32,500
knowledge aspect and it has potential

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,190
economic benefit to Susan yeah

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,290
absolutely

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:39,310
so that's why Susan came up with an

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,050
academic program and here we are so what

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,660
you see is the academic program what

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:48,730
does it focus on its focuses on on

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:54,100
getting trained as an instructor and

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:58,960
teaching Susan technology and developing

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:02,020
on Susan and and using Susan those three

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,870
elements are the elements that are now

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:08,680
into the academic program of Susan

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,890
involved and when I say Susan technology

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,570
I'm not just talking abouts les hommes

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,850
as you probably have seen here at the

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,300
conference you already know but many

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:23,620
people still understand and still see

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,530
Sousa as just a Linux company but um our

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,480
technologies that we focus on the open

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,390
source technologies are more spread than

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,760
just less so also the academic program

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,180
focuses on storage clouds

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,200
Susan manager and of course steals less

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,540
and when you're going to train students

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,640
and teachers first the teachers and then

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,080
students at least that's the way it

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,320
should go

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,000
in Susa technology there is

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,440
certification available as well so it's

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,920
not just the training and it's not just

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,540
getting the students up to the right

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,660
level of knowledge there is even

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:08,650
possibility if you are a university to

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,800
test this knowledge by using the same

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,470
certification model as is being used in

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,760
the commercial SUSE industry so

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:21,460
we've got a certification overview at

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,830
the bottom you've got the administrator

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,560
level and on top of that engineer level

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:30,010
and if you have gathered a whole bunch

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,720
of the certifications below you can

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:37,000
become an architect in Susan but it

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,560
starts with certification and then all

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,570
the four technologies I just mentioned

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,430
you can get administrative level

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,190
certification on top of that engineer

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,490
level certification any people certified

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,450
in any of the Sousa technologies here

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,260
somebody in the back there yes great

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:55,120
only one person

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,330
now that's something we have to get up

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,920
then we have to get up that people that

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,430
are using Sousa technology that they are

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,430
certified in as well and that's where

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,960
actually one of the goals of a Sousa

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,940
academic program as well to get more

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:16,630
people certified so let's do a little

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,520
bit of a recap um as I said two years

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,790
ago when I started with Sousa there was

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,270
no academic program so when people came

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,010
to me and asked can I use the training

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,720
material that Suze has developed for the

00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,330
commercial markets can I use it for my

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,570
students the answer was no unfortunately

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,400
it was not possible another loud so we

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,720
had to come with an academic program and

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,570
before that um they were of course

00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,690
universities and different technical

00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:51,340
education nonprofit education that we

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,880
had in our as a customer base and we had

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,090
different models for them but um we kept

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,150
on supporting that model but we didn't

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:03,730
welcome any new universities anymore at

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:07,290
that time and now we have our academic

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:11,440
program with where everybody can join in

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:14,680
so if we look at the academic program of

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,310
Susan as I said it focuses on the two

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:21,970
elements the element of the operations

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:25,610
that's just a software that the school

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:29,140
uses for their infrastructure

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:32,570
and a curriculum how is it build up

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,420
there versus the slide again so it's

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:40,790
about getting trained the instructors

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:42,740
getting trained the students if you like

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,920
to develop further on the technology

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:50,210
that's built in the model as well and of

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,540
course we like to the software to be

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:57,500
used by students so what does it look

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:01,580
like there is three layers and the first

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,750
layer and it's totally out of cost so

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:08,810
there is no fee there is no minimum

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,240
order there are not many demands other

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,040
than you have to be a university so if

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,920
you want to become part of our suits

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,810
academic program everybody can become a

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:24,320
program a part of our program as long as

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:29,810
you're a non-profit educational

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,990
institute can you read this is this all

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:38,360
no it's too small right um so I'll do a

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:42,380
little bit of fruit-picking here if you

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:45,230
sign up to this level of the program you

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:49,610
will get free access to all the training

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:56,210
material we have available and you will

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:58,460
get a campus license to use Susan we

00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,890
will even make certification available

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:04,370
and that's being developed right now for

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,810
the commercial Institute's if somebody

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,720
in the labelmark ones to become

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:12,709
certified the cost for an exam to become

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,180
a certified are between hundred fifty

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,870
and one hundred and ninety five US

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:20,209
dollar per exam for the academic

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:23,060
institutions we are developing right now

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,380
a bilk model which will be a lot a lot

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,830
cheaper we are really trying to get the

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:34,430
boundary to become certified if you are

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:35,930
a Suzy technologies or student and

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,380
you're like Suzy and you want to do the

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:45,660
exam that it's very easy to become

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:48,090
certified and also very cheap and free

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,190
has free access to the SDK as well so

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:54,770
the software development kit is part of

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,770
this first layer as well and then um

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,440
yeah that's I think that's the most

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,300
important things out of the first layer

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,570
then there is a second layer and that's

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,360
actually when you're going to talk about

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:14,490
the software that the university are

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,130
using yourself and so if a university is

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,950
already using souza

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,720
they can use it and if they want to use

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,120
a lot of technologies and a lot of

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,830
products of us compared to the

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,210
commercial market there is a very very

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,400
low entry and a cheap model where you

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,530
still can get all the services and all

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,760
the support that a commercial company

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:41,430
gets as well and there is a third layer

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,950
if you really want to go deep into the

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,950
technology as a university it's not

00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,760
about teaching this is about using the

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:55,080
software for your own for your own

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:58,830
stated your own environment your own

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,470
infrastructure and so that's the three

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,590
layer model that d'souza academic

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:09,510
program consists of is that clear any

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:12,870
questions on the three steps model okay

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:17,400
then I'll move on this is even more

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:19,020
detail about the new academic program in

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,750
the description of this talk I promise

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:26,910
to give detail about academic program so

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:29,760
I will but I will glance over it and so

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:36,590
if we look here at the first bailer the

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:40,410
education there is training material and

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:43,350
certification available for all teachers

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:47,310
but compared to the commercial model

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:50,310
it's not you don't have to be certified

00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,010
as an instructor before you teach it so

00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,460
we made it again as

00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:59,600
low boundary as possible but on the

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,780
other end it's not mandatory but I do

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,850
recommend that as an instructor you look

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,280
at the certification and you try the

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:11,180
exams before you go and teach it but

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,090
it's not mandatory it's all focused on

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,890
getting as many people as possible

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,780
trained in Susan um so there will be a

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:24,770
specific material there a specific

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,220
material which is only to use for

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,950
nonprofit and non-commercial

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:34,760
institutions and it will be clearly

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,560
signed as material for this market and

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,530
of course it's not allowed to use the

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,660
material outside these non-commercial

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,390
Institute's because we've got a

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,820
commercial training program where

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,650
actually the goal is not to make money

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,660
for Susan so we're not making money on

00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,570
the suit on the training material what

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,210
we do is we try to get as many people as

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:59,510
possible trained in the technology so

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,760
again there is no commercial but we do

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,400
have commercial training partners not as

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,490
ourselves but training partners like

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,650
here in Germany one of the training

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,540
partners that pops up to mind is b1 I've

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,570
seen many people from b1 here as well

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,480
they are a training partner here in

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:23,450
Germany and that's a commercial training

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:27,110
partner um

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:29,450
training material just on on paper there

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,690
is also only mount training material

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:37,669
available for the academic institutions

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,870
so if you want to get your knowledge up

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,260
to level there are different

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:48,320
possibilities to get there so the second

00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,080
pillar that's a lot about if you using

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,620
Susy technology in your infrastructure

00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,929
and the third is more if you want to use

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,110
the tools so the software development

00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,940
kit and if you really wanna go want to

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,630
go deep into the technology you might

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,659
like to be like we interested if you're

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,960
really teaching high level technology

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:16,149
and your students then this pillar is

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,100
interesting because we deliver a lot of

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,990
possibilities that are normally only

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,299
offered for commercial institutions and

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:26,600
now also available for academic

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:29,899
institutions and then we are setting up

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:34,250
a academic program and one of the first

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:36,669
things in September 25th till 29th of

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,620
September in Prague there will be the

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:41,630
Seussical I don't know if any of the

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,630
openSUSE people know about that but

00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:47,600
we've got a big conference coming up and

00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:51,549
that's a quite big fun I must say fun

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,789
very informative from technical talks to

00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:58,360
informative talks great examples of

00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:03,830
where the technology has been used in

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:06,860
with customers of Susan and I can say

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:10,010
out of my own experience visiting now to

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,899
souza cons that it's really something

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,279
great to go through and also if you're

00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:17,330
in structuring you want to take the

00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,779
students to proc and it's a great

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,740
possibility and there is high discount

00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:26,659
offered for universities academic

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,730
institutions that are part of an

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:31,220
academic program if you want to know

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,409
exact discounts on the tickets and

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,320
everything please come to me afterwards

00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:40,230
now this explain how the model works

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,850
but always meant that we have a lot of

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:46,590
university in a lot of young people

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:49,500
coming to Sousa calm so here's a promise

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,899
call to action um it's quite easy

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:59,509
actually the call to action because it's

00:23:51,899 --> 00:24:03,029
just go to the website WWE and subscribe

00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:05,639
you just subscribe there and if you want

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,169
to become part of the academic program

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:10,169
and you're recognized as a

00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:13,519
non-commercial Institute so you fulfill

00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:15,840
the requirements then literally

00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:21,379
immediately you are part of a program

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,379
and you can benefit from the benefits

00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:29,519
once you are allowed into the program

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,340
you will have access to a special portal

00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:35,039
it's built by Susan and this portal will

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,169
give you access to the on-demand

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,980
training I talked about will give you

00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:43,649
access to all sorts of things um how you

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,750
can get your knowledge up to speed how

00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:50,509
to certification work all explanation

00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,509
about further details of the program

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:57,210
then I've got the Raspberry Pi here

00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:01,529
I actually took one with me and we've

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:05,149
got arm here and Raspberry Pi I think

00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:08,220
that and it's totally out of the

00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:11,100
academic program of Sousa actually but

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:16,070
when I've been looking at the markets

00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:19,259
for universities to be able to train

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:23,159
Susan I think the Raspberry Pi with

00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:27,899
Susan because it's now all available

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:31,220
without cost for a year to use a tutu

00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:34,590
runs less on the Raspberry Pi

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,669
does anybody of you agree with me that

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:41,779
it can be great step forward to teach

00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:43,320
Susan technologies using a Raspberry Pi

00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:47,240
Wow

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,240
yes um can you explain

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,150
yeah

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,390
so I'll quickly repeat otherwise they

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,310
have to run up with the microphone all

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:09,630
it's very easy that's basically what you

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:11,310
said and the explanation we got it was

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,980
launched at Suzy Cohen in Washington

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:16,020
last year what how they explained it and

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,090
I like the quite a lot was done by Aaron

00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,850
quill one of our high technology

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,220
architects probably has another function

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,900
named but he's quite a Google guy and he

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,960
had a picture of himself working on a

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,570
machine in nineteen something long ago

00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,170
and he was working on that machine at

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,460
home when he was about 12 year old and

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,500
when he was working on that machine and

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,710
he came into the real world where

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,540
information technology was being used he

00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,390
found that what he learned on that

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,260
machine he had at home I wasn't really

00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:51,810
useful to him but if we were able to

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,910
close the gap between the machine that

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,040
you use at home and the machines are

00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,780
being used until the very biggest

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,300
machines the mainframes

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,380
there's also mainframe run on Susan then

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:08,220
you can have the whole line of machines

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,720
from RM RM machines raspberry pies until

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,460
the mainframe and everything in between

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:17,250
runs on Susan so I thought that aspect

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:21,720
is really great why it's now fantastic

00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:26,930
to have it's less available on the

00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,120
Raspberry Pi as trying to

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,640
 but doesn't have the button so

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,210
let's do it like this yeah well here is

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,150
the Suzy comb as I said Suzy come at in

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,370
September and well not that far away

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,330
from here

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:46,280
so you're all very welcome and

00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:49,370
especially the people from academic

00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:53,270
institutions where we have the special

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:55,670
program for so to call fractions

00:27:53,270 --> 00:28:00,650
actually I like to see you again at

00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:05,650
Sousa Khan 2015 in Prague and you can go

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:05,650
to the website wwm

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:16,630
and you're all welcome any questions at

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,630
this point about the academic program

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,740
would you like to use a microphone yes

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,640
as Susan willing to share next to their

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:36,860
codebase also stuff like this with the

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:40,250
open social community um I sorry I don't

00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,250
understand what what are what is Susan

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,570
not sharing with openSUSE is that um is

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,330
there something we are not sharing

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:52,460
you're talking about the material being

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:54,650
wrong in fact closed to outsiders good

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,260
openSUSE people have access to the

00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,930
material to use it for open source of

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,020
trainings oh the training material

00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,550
that's available you're talking about

00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,660
the training material that we've

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:14,300
developed at Susan that's being used to

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:16,400
train both our customers partners and

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,940
now also students if it's also available

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,480
for people from the openSUSE community

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,840
yeah

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,660
that's your question um it's a good

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,230
question um we have got our material

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,720
available through the training partners

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,910
so if you are known with the training

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,389
partner as I said in Germany we've got

00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:41,309
four partners in the Netherlands one

00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:44,049
all over email 40 training partners and

00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:48,190
they are now responsible for dividing

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:50,829
and delivering the training including

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,289
training material to the market in those

00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:56,109
countries so if you have specific

00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:59,019
questions you can either come to me I

00:29:56,109 --> 00:30:01,389
can tell you who is delivering training

00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,759
material in your country and then it's

00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:07,570
up to the commercial training company

00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:10,359
and you to find a solution and if you're

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,249
working for university it's even easier

00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,589
because then you have access through the

00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:16,779
material to the academic program I hope

00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:17,139
that answers your question says yes it

00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:18,809
does

00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:21,039
all right great thank you very much

00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:22,929
great question actually I didn't think

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,109
about that aspect of the training

00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,469
material being available any other

00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:32,279
questions yes you have been talking

00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:34,839
about a academic Institute or

00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,659
organizations in general but also very

00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:40,419
often you have mentioned universities so

00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:43,139
I have done a kind of contacts with some

00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:46,419
local University and also some IT

00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:48,820
schools so I would like to know if s if

00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:51,219
there is any difference regarding the

00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,429
program for from a university or

00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:56,799
something such a small let's say yeah oh

00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:00,099
yes excellent question

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,979
they are quite clear regulation set up

00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:07,349
and actually it Como's all comes down to

00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:10,419
as long as it doesn't compete with my

00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:15,039
commercial training partners then I'm

00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:17,969
fine so if it's a very small comic

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,389
Institute and they have no commercial

00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:24,009
side business or something then

00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:27,070
absolutely everybody is very he'll come

00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:29,379
to join the academic program in fact

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,019
once you subscribe depending on where

00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:35,129
you are in the world we will look for

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:37,419
every single person every single

00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:40,659
subscription to the academic program if

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:44,169
it's truly academic but we you can even

00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:46,479
have like the police school in the

00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:49,539
Netherlands the military schools those

00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:54,159
kind of institutions are also fulfilling

00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:55,960
the requirements so we are not strict as

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,909
long as it's not interfering of the

00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,889
commercial training business is that in

00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:01,919
clear answer to your question yes okay

00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:04,539
thank you very much like to hear the

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,820
institutions you're talking about any

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,330
other questions yeah I would like to

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,999
know in the past there was a CompTIA

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,899
here in the back hi in the past there

00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:17,309
was a CompTIA

00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:20,289
training certification including LPI

00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:23,320
Suzanne CompTIA as well is this going to

00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:25,119
be the case in the future again a very

00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,970
good question if you've been talking

00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:31,179
about this before a very good question

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,749
at LPI CompTIA and Susan there was a

00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:37,090
cooperation regarding the certification

00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:39,840
if you did to come to your certification

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:45,039
you would get the Susan administrator

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:48,369
Linux level and the LPI level one along

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:53,139
side and from Susan we had to stop that

00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:55,179
project because we had people certifying

00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:58,149
for Susan technology while they never

00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:01,450
ever touched a Susan machine and that

00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:02,950
was a challenge we had to deal with so

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,899
we had to figure something out and we

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:09,549
have actually came up with a solution

00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:11,080
for that because if you are now if I can

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:12,309
easily get the picture back with the

00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,899
certification but we've got the

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,340
certification in different levels and

00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:21,609
what we did now is if you think because

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:26,440
of your CompTIA or LPI certification

00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:28,450
that you qualify for the higher level so

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,749
the engineer level certification you can

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,629
straight go to that exam skip the lower

00:33:31,749 --> 00:33:37,330
level exam and if you pass the higher

00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:41,889
level exam you will get backwards also

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:44,019
the lower level exam that means that we

00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,259
have covered that everybody who is got a

00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:51,340
Sousa certification knows the technology

00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:54,999
but you still have the biggest Pro of

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,700
that old model that if you are LPI of or

00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:59,739
CompTIA certified for linux technology

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,259
in general and you prove to us that you

00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:03,550
also know Sousa technology by succeeding

00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,320
the other exam

00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,320
you don't have to do two exams only one

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,130
exam and you're you're ready and you

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,580
were certified at the highest level okay

00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,210
thank you

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:18,130
is it clear yeah okay let's thanks

00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:22,240
another question Linux Foundation has

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:26,409
also on certification by now how is our

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:31,540
or Susie's academic process influencing

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:34,030
or in regards to that it's it's the same

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,540
so it's the same as LP I in CompTIA

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:39,820
there are a few minor differences but

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,179
it's about the same ID so if you prove

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:46,090
to be certified at linux technology at

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,460
the entry level you can go into the

00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,820
higher level of pseudo certification and

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:54,340
once you pass you get the other one

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:57,100
afterwards so it works the same great

00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,220
question is actually really good at look

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,550
next question yes what was the decision

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:07,210
to actually look at ruling out the

00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,370
private universities and it in any

00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,470
for-profit or did you come up with a

00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:14,710
model are you talking about coming up

00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,930
with a model for private universities or

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,370
even charter schools we look at and in

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,760
that case there's sort of private they

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:25,030
make money you know I mean it seems like

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,110
you're you're the program while good yes

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:32,320
is ruling out a certain area I think we

00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,880
would want to address and perhaps I mean

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,870
maybe it's somewhere in between the

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,930
commercial and and the not nonprofit

00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:43,990
school yeah yeah you're perfectly right

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,710
it is a gray area in the Netherlands

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,210
we've got companies who are sort of

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:54,329
training students but they have a

00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:56,999
commercial goal and there are clear

00:35:54,329 --> 00:36:00,390
guidelines and we will keep those

00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:04,049
guidelines we'll look at them and judge

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,719
whether or not it's competing but for

00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:08,699
some countries I will look into it if

00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,679
it's not competing with my commercial

00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:13,559
institutions and if my commercial

00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:18,059
training partners don't mind that that

00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:20,999
specific commercial academy becomes a

00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:24,239
part of the academic program then I'm

00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:26,249
fine with it as well so the main goal of

00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,739
sue's is to train as many people as

00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:30,630
possible in Susa technology color as

00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:32,309
many people as possible green but we

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,229
only can do that if the commercial

00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:36,900
training partners are having a good

00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:38,339
business case if we are destroying the

00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,259
business case of the commercial training

00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,999
partners we will have no commercial

00:36:40,259 --> 00:36:43,979
institutions who bring our training to

00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:45,839
the market so that's basically the

00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:48,239
challenge that we're dealing with but

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:51,029
the gray area I'm willing to look at the

00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,609
gray area and see if we can come up with

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:55,349
a solution if they either have to fit

00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:58,109
into the commercial model or in the

00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:00,179
academic model so please start the

00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:04,429
discussion and we will find some way to

00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:08,719
get as many people as possible at green

00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:12,239
any other questions here in the front

00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:14,369
Thanks and how do you plan to advertise

00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,859
the program do you plan to go directly

00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:19,559
to universities and advertise it or go

00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,469
to university fairs or what is the plan

00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,119
Wow those questions really good I did it

00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:29,069
this is more about the marketing and

00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:31,170
we've decided that we create an academic

00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:33,209
program because there was a demand there

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,249
was a demand from academic institutions

00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:39,079
come up with a program so that's what we

00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:42,689
did but the focus of suzhen is on

00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:45,869
helping customers and selling

00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:48,449
subscriptions getting happy customers

00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:51,660
and what we've done we've created a

00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:55,049
program and our goal and and maybe hope

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,989
is that the program will totally sustain

00:37:55,049 --> 00:38:01,109
itself so everything should be available

00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:02,789
and there are people picking up the

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:06,119
phone if you have specific questions so

00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:07,269
we've got two people one for MA one for

00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,890
the rest of the world

00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:10,569
picking up the phone if you have a

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:15,880
question about the academic program

00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:18,189
we're trying to keep it that low I say

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,499
that labor so that we don't have to

00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:23,049
invest too much time in getting it but

00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:25,479
on the interns I was allowed by Suzi to

00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:27,249
come up here to come to Nuremberg and to

00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:28,839
present the academic program and I've

00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:30,640
been presenting it two weeks ago in the

00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,439
Netherlands and I will do with a couple

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,169
of more times at different places so

00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:37,179
that is the marketing but we really hope

00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:40,269
that it will sort of fly off itself

00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:42,939
because we think we've created a program

00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:44,799
which has such a low boundaries as an

00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:47,919
academic Institute why would you not

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:50,289
enter this program if you compared it to

00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:52,919
commercial vendors who have academic

00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:55,479
programs then they're quite often are

00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:59,109
you have to pay a certain amount or

00:38:55,479 --> 00:39:00,789
they're there all kinds of boundaries

00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,849
you have to get over well this program

00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:05,649
that's how we hope it will work if it

00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,299
doesn't work like this so if not enough

00:39:05,649 --> 00:39:10,089
people know about the academic program

00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:12,909
in some time we will evaluate it and we

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:19,829
will start a marketing campaign is that

00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:19,829
a satisfactory answer somehow somehow

00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:28,449
yeah you think yeah yes and no um well

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,449
if it will work out like this and we

00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:34,149
will see but if it doesn't work out we

00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:37,539
will pick it up and bring it to a higher

00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:40,029
marketing level but um maybe the if the

00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:43,419
openSUSE community likes it a lot and

00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:45,579
you all here at this room like the IDE

00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:47,679
what we all can do is bring it to social

00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,389
media and shout it out tell it to

00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:54,159
everybody you know that there is a very

00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:57,249
easy to to subscribe to academic program

00:39:54,159 --> 00:40:01,829
and let the word of mouth as its called

00:39:57,249 --> 00:40:03,880
do its work any other questions

00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:05,890
No

00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,359
well thank you very much and I really

00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,279
want to thank you specifically for those

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,430
questions at the end because they were

00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:15,549
really really great questions and again

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,670

the marketing we do for now and if you

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:23,049
have any questions about the academic

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,920
program feel free to approach me at any

00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:32,840
time thank you very much everybody bye
