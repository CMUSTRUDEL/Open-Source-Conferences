SUSE Academic Program explained

The new SUSE Academic Program explained!
As a leading open source company, SUSE supports schools, higher learning institutions and the academic community in getting free access to our extensive experience and knowledge.
Many IT-students still get trained in software stacks that are not the highest in demand by the labor market. In many cases IT-infrastructure classes are still dominated by proprietary software, but the dominating IT-infrastructure "in real life" nowadays is open source technology.
As SUSE delivers enterprise open source technology many schools have asked SUSE to come with a academic program now we are able to explain you most bits and bites of how we believe we can color schools and students green!
