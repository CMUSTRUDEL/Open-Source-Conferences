Continuous testing and delivery, the YaST way

In this talk we will briefly explore all the mechanisms and workflows used by the YaST developers in order to share as much code as possible between all the SUSE and openSUSE distributions, while ensuring the quality of all the different YaST modules.

Learn how Rake, unit tests, Github, Jenkins, Travis, OBS and even Docker are used to deliver the developer's work to the already released products (via maintenance updates), to the ones still to be released and to our rolling distribution Tumbleweed.
