The Legal Review happening in the Factory development process is a black box for many, even though it's very important for keeping openSUSE away from danger. But many only know the downside of this requirement: if the review takes "too long".

This presentation is trying to shed light into the black box and show the processes and applications used. Explaining the challenges and pitfalls - and the actions we took to speed up the process.
