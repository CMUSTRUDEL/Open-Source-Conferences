A little over a year ago I found myself doing the Distro Dance. Trying to decide which Linux distro to use for a new datacenter deployment. I was starting to question my old solid choice, CentOS, and decided to go with SUSE.
Join me as I go over my journey to SUSE, and why I am now convinced that it is the best Linux Distro out there today.
Also see how I am convincing people to switch to SUSE and abandon the old ways of Linux for the chameleon.

alright now I'm going to take advantage

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,210
of your house

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm going to give you a softball talk so

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,570
my name is Thomas hatch I'm the CTO of

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,050
saltstack

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,930
and so so I'm giving a keynote tomorrow

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,900
I usually have to give a lot of very

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,020
technical talks and very in-depth and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:37,379
visionary talks and I never get to give

00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:40,129
a talk for fun and so I presented or

00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:42,510
sorry I submitted a softball talk and

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,250
probably just because you're being nice

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,830
to me you let me you let me get up here

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:52,350
and talk about it basically what I want

00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:59,059
to go through is how I introduce modern

00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:02,309
souza to people because I have some

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,720
strange looks I will admit when people

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,620
ask me about Linux distribution I'm

00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,140
running and I go well souza of course so

00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,420
let me kind of just talk through some of

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,520
these things and I noticed that there

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,690
are other talks that use a dr.

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,370
Strangelove reference in the title if

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,360
you haven't seen the movie dr.

00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:29,070
Strangelove it is absolutely hilarious

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:35,490
okay so it all started with a guy named

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:41,160
Bo so I get this email from Bo almost

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,290
two years ago and he says to me Sousa is

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:51,380
going to start using the ever-loving

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:55,680
crap out of salt and my response was so

00:01:51,380 --> 00:02:00,740
your Sousa I don't care that's honestly

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,250
what I thought and so a little later

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,920
honestly only a few weeks later when I

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,289
ran into was that we needed to reinstall

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,780
the base operating systems on one of our

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:19,409
test environments in our QA lab and I

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,689
thought well I have to at least look at

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,280
Sousa and I have been deeply offended by

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:25,080
a certain other Enterprise Linux

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,650
distribution lately

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,260
and so I started to look at Sousa oh I

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,140
have a picture of Bo if any of you if

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:45,330
any of you don't know Bo this is this is

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:47,130
what he looks like okay that's actually

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,900
how I honestly described him to people

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:55,190
big nose alright so I had to put a

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,250
couple of my old Sousa biases aside and

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,770
a lot of this came from honestly one of

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,540
my biggest old Sousa biases is that I

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,640
felt like you did set up the Apache

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:14,940
configs in a weird way that bothered me

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:16,410
I'm I've gotten over that and so this is

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,630
also this is the main thing that I

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,030
renamed you when when I start talking to

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,090
people about Sousa again I'm from the

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:28,010
United States where you know things are

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,690
kind of crazy over there right now and

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:34,890
and so I'll admit Sousa is not a very

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,770
popular distribution in the US and so I

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,030
usually get this kind of kickback

00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,310
ironically even though I'm in Utah and

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:49,320
you know you guys have some ties over

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:51,690
there for better for worse okay and I

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,860
will have to admit on the third point I

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,910
kind of like yes now I'm almost

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:10,560
embarrassed to say it it's it's really

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:12,870
convenient okay so the the main thing

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,810
that started to change my mind was how

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:22,140
Sousa openSUSE changed their approach to

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:25,169
releases again right after bo sent me

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,630
this email I go to the openSUSE website

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:32,940
and go okay I'm going to take a look at

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:36,539
openSUSE and I was unaware of the whole

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:40,990
leap tumbleweed thing that was going on

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:43,930
and the big problem that I generally had

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,960
was I'm an old arch linux guy

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,069
I love Arch Linux I used to be an arch

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,439
linux packager etcetera etcetera but in

00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:56,050
the data center I would always use

00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,759
CentOS I wouldn't use anything other

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:02,110
than CentOS or anything related to

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:06,370
CentOS just sent us and I found it

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,219
frustrating that I lived in this to

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,479
distribution world where I felt that I

00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:13,750
needed a completely different

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,090
distribution for my laptop then I needed

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,949
for my servers whether they were in the

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,250
data center or at my house

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:24,279
and upon learning about leap I got

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,770
really excited about this because all of

00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:29,560
a sudden I can use a rolling distro

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:33,759
because six-month distribution releases

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:39,550
are silly and dumb so hooray I can use a

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:42,789
rolling release but also I've got a

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,020
completely free operating system which

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:49,629
is more than sufficiently stable to run

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:54,870
the the vast majority of my server needs

00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:57,339
and so I like to compare this to using

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,139
multiple programming languages we

00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,270
already had a little trolling from Joe

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,580
earlier if you were in this room about

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,169
using multiple programming languages and

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:11,319
how that's morally wrong and I I agree

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,159
with other commenters that the solution

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:18,360
is not more perl it's let it's less perl

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:20,830
I'm not a big pearl fan or Java sorry

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,949
but then again I would endorse the use

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:29,219
of Giulia if anyone's used Giulia it's

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,219
brilliant I'm not serious

00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,739
but in programming often we do have to

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,779
say we're going to use something like

00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:40,599
Python for high-level get a lot of stuff

00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,309
done prototyping and then have C so that

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:47,139
we can optimize performance what we need

00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:49,119
to and I didn't like having the same the

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,669
same problem inside of my operating

00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:53,349
systems and that's a really strong

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,839
selling point for people to be able to

00:06:53,349 --> 00:07:01,599
explain how well tested tumbleweed is

00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:08,229
tumbleweed is beautiful is Richard Brown

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:14,259
in here oh that's good okay yeah

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:17,769
tumbleweed is beautiful all right and so

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:20,529
I begin to feel that this idea this

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,079
concept of a rolling release plus an

00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:26,589
enterprise release and the overall way

00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:28,209
the souza develops software develops the

00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:30,759
operating system and pushes it out was

00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:35,229
far and away the optimal mechanism and

00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:38,589
again I felt that this six-month release

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:42,389
cycle concept is is well I think it's a

00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:44,860
waste of a lot of people's time okay and

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,959
then the benefit I felt is that the

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,629
enterprise software existed in the right

00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,379
place that it was the right type of

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,239
upsell and the right type of ramp to get

00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,649
somebody moving from certain

00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:58,479
environments on a rolling release

00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:01,269
certain environments on leap certain

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,819
environments on sleds and I felt that

00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:07,659
was a lot smoother now I don't remember

00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:10,509
who wrote this blog post but someone

00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:14,589
from souza wrote a blog post about how

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:21,309
Souza makes decisions and then commits

00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:28,969
to them was that you Joe I really didn't

00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:32,360
mean to compliment Joe actually

00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:35,319
a really good blog post and and this is

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:38,120
something that really struck me because

00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:40,310
coming from a certain other

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,459
distributions whose names may or may not

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,199
appear on this slide I'd become very

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,389
frustrated with things kind of flopping

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:51,379
around you know should I be using Zen

00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:54,410
should I be using KBM is butter FS still

00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:59,060
going to work in six-point-nine etc etc

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,189
and I began to really appreciate Souza

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,220
and the fact that they still put up with

00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:04,910
Reiser and fast for instance good job

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,310
guys

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,620
you know I think Reiser FS was very

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:16,009
brilliant for its time obviously not

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,360
quite brilliant enough now all right so

00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,189
the next major problem that we're

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,319
running that that I feel is very

00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:24,050
important from the perspective

00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:26,120
particularly deploying inside of a data

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,670
center has to do with the ability to

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,680
back port software packages so let me go

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,420
back to the story where we're at saul

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,209
stack we're determining what

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,399
distribution to use underneath the new

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,740
cloud deployment and it was a pretty

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,439
small cloud and so we go what will just

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,720
use open nebula get this thing up and

00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:49,160
going pretty quick doesn't need to be

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,459
complicated or fancy and we start to

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,879
install open nebula on susah and I told

00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,959
one of my one of my engineers okay we're

00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,129
gonna try Souza

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,720
and it was Tuesday and I said if it

00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:06,379
comes to Friday and you're frustrated

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,790
mad we can we can back out because no

00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:11,930
one in the company had ever used Souza

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:18,620
at this point this this engineers named

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:21,500
CR wonderful wonderful man he comes back

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,870
to me on Thursday and I'm fully

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,529
expecting him to say yeah Tom nuts to

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,089
the Souza garbage and he comes and he

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,199
walks into my office and he starts

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,170
talking about something completely

00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,639
different right and I and I asked him

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,709
hold on hold on huh what about what

00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,839
about the server deployment I mean

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:42,110
weren't you doing this why are you

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,439
asking me about code and he says oh no

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,439
I'm done

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,760
but so everything's okay

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:55,730
oh yeah everything's fine I'm like so

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,560
did you use Sousa he says yeah yeah it

00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,990
was really interesting because at that

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,550
point again it had been two days he's in

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,310
my office and he says not only have I

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,650
reinstalled all the servers but I mean

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,200
there's no more bun two on my laptop I'm

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:15,710
running tumbleweed I have been converted

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:19,730
and the thing that did it for him was

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:21,740
OBS and he stayed for snapper but more

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,550
on that later but the thing that did it

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,410
for him was OBS because he started to

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,480
deploy open nebula and the open nebula

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:34,700
packages he could find for openSUSE were

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:38,930
horribly out of date and this is this is

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,060
a showstopper a lot of the time that it

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,710
becomes very very difficult to say ah

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,260
nuts you know I really wanted to use

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,880
this particular piece of software but

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,630
just because the vendor doesn't happen

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,160
to be all over it I'm going to have to

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:58,220
go through the trouble of building my

00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:02,120
own packages but you guys have OBS thank

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,430
you I don't have to build a local

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,440
package build environment that schrutes

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,250
stuff

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,610
thank you and so he's in my office and

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,530
he says oh I just tweaked a couple of

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,530
existing rpms put him on OBS so we were

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:23,960
done they built in a few minutes and we

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:27,500
were able to deploy our cloud so thank

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:31,220
you for OBS thank you for being

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,900
brilliant and to building that I'm not

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,320
actually going to badmouth anything else

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,730
from the stage apart from a certain

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:45,080
certain other build system fills me with

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:48,140
rage okay finally talking a little bit

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,570
more about tumbleweed there's an old

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,490
joke in the arch Arch Linux community is

00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,430
it owned in here ever run Arch Linux

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,740
before

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,570
okay okay I'm going to assume the

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,160
numbers actually higher in the most of

00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,620
you are just afraid to admit it in this

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:09,110
room so the old joke in the arch

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,150
community is something's broken

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,550
so I'll just update in a few days and

00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,460
that'll go away sure something else will

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:20,570
be broken but at least this problem will

00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:22,100
go away if the arch isn't only a rolling

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,900
release and don't get me wrong I still

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,000
adore arch arch isn't only a rolling

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,340
release but it's it's kind of like a

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,530
wheel that every time it turns it's flat

00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:40,790
in a different place and I was

00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:44,510
astonished by how thoroughly tumbleweed

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:48,760
gets tested and as a as an arch packager

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:51,770
I was very aware of the amount of effort

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,160
that certain arch packagers put into

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:59,180
their packages wasn't always quite to

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:03,190
the same level as the tumbleweed project

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:06,950
to put it as kindly as I possibly can

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,320
sometimes it was rather reckless one of

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,590
the one of the main reasons I love

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,350
packaging salt on arch linux is because

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,660
if there's ever an upstream issue with a

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,480
dependency in any plausible or

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:29,230
conceivable way we will find out about

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:31,490
it in arch very quickly all right so the

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,470
ridiculously thorough amount of testing

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:47,330
is something that I'm very very grateful

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:52,690
for so in in the old days when you would

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:56,450
install a UNIX style operating system

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:59,680
and if you install FreeBSD who who here

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,440
is installed freebsd in the last year

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,220
who very nice

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,020
I haven't installed in last year so so

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,420
I'm running on like two years ago on

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:15,460
this reference but so I apologize if I'm

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:17,560
wrong don't don't get after me okay so

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,800
if you install FreeBSD you can still

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,530
install it with slices or partitioning

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,200
it in the classical UNIX way right

00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:29,770
you've got your var sub directories

00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:34,050
isolated etc etc so that if something

00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:37,120
logs like crazy everything's fine right

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:42,120
one of the things that blew me away just

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:46,150
installing souza was how meticulously

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:50,950
well the butter FS deployments are laid

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:54,310
out that they are very carefully thought

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,470
through that they are by default matched

00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,250
with the packaging and deployment and

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:04,120
configuration options and how they line

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,060
up the right copy-on-write style etc etc

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:13,420
all of the right flags are there for all

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:17,620
of the right butter FS components and I

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,960
was just very impressed by that and then

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,180
the next thing that I found astonishing

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,150
this engineers CR I told you about came

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,150
up to me a couple of months after we

00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,770
deployed these systems and asked me if I

00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,440
had ever used snapper at that point I

00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:33,730
hadn't heard of snapper yet after after

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,710
I was introduced to snapper I actually

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,030
sent I think I sent Bo an email saying

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:44,590
so I've learned about snapper and open

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,380
QA and OBS what other magical souza

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:50,520
things am i missing and he introduced me

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,520
to quite a few more

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:58,660
like OSC I love the OSC command blank by

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,730
the way I don't I don't really know that

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:05,380
those guys would ever need to rewrite

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:07,620
that sorry for those of you who weren't

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:14,620
here that's what the last talk was about

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:19,799
okay I became instantly infatuated with

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,799
snapper I mean this this thing is cool

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,240
to the extend that I started

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,960
purposefully doing all sorts of crazy

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,120
things to break my laptop because all of

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,880
a sudden I felt far more liberated than

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,679
I have ever been before and then

00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,299
thoroughly enjoyed just booting into an

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,460
old snapshot it was it was excellent and

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,650
all my problems went away I can install

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,419
all of those third-party repositories

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,669
you know the ones that you install but

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:52,200
you don't tell anybody about especially

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,200
Richard Brown because he gets all upset

00:17:52,860 --> 00:18:01,809
he's still not here right um yeah and

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:05,830
then the abilities just boot into the

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:08,590
past so seamlessly and so similarly I

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,690
was thoroughly impressed by the fact

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:15,270
that snapper ran automatically right

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,270
whenever you ran zipper or you asked

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,970
that that I built

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:24,669
snapper support directly into salts

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,450
configuration management runtime so that

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:30,910
every time you're in salt you can

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,370
snapshot back as the first time is and

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,070
still when we get customers who come to

00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:39,790
us and they say well we want we want

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,730
full rollback and we explain to them

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:52,450
that that's a myth unless you install

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:53,240
Sousa ok oh I already mentioned this

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,670
because because

00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,770
Joe brought it up in his excellent blog

00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:03,800
post but Souza sticks it out and they

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:09,950
seem to have very good judgment because

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:11,600
they chose salt I'm not biased okay but

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:19,210
yeah I did remain I did mention this

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:25,340
before but Souza sticks it out my dad

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:29,450
back in the late 70s spent a few years

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:31,910
living in Germany and so he would tell

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,670
us stories growing up about the Germans

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:41,150
and how they are different than

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:42,500
fantastic in very specific ways and one

00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,080
of the things that he would say is that

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,260
Germans will take a long time to make a

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,790
decision because they want to make the

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,620
right decision because I don't a bank

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:54,010
have to back out of that decision now I

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,910
don't know how true that is I'm

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,190
generally under the impression that's

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,820
true interfacing with you lot you seem

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:05,120
to take careful wise decisions and then

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,040
stick with them but again this is this

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,030
is something I've deeply grown to

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,670
appreciate in the way suza is engineered

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,640
and also in the commitments that Souza

00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:20,660
makes to its customers and its users I

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,340
feel much safer over the long run with

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:29,990
Sousa than I do with other operating

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:30,950
systems because I mean I know that you

00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:34,940
know you guys are going to make mistakes

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:39,080
that happens and I'm very forgiving of

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:41,090
those mistakes but having that long-term

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,820
confidence is something that I really

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,860
like the fact that I feel very

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,220
comfortable that if Sousa says you

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,720
should use software X that they're not

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,100
going to back out and change that

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,100
decision on me really soon

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:01,190
yeah and

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:03,800
thank you for not using upstart ideally

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:11,120
appreciate that have you ever tried to

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:15,410
automate upstart oh okay so in a

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:19,240
nutshell this is my pitch when people

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:22,340
say what dish are using and I say Souza

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:26,059
duh and then give me that funny look

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:30,470
like I'm a madman and they want me to

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:32,750
like use some things it blows my mind

00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,250
because because they say with what

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,500
lineage is your visionary using and I

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,420
say I'm using souza of course and they

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,280
give this look like seriously like I'm

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,350
crazy and then I ask them what what

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,910
Linux distribution are you using and

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:51,740
they're like Linux from scratch and

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:54,530
hence well who's the crazy guy or they

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:59,080
say something like we we deploy

00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:02,030
production servers on fedora no I

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:08,150
actually worked for a company that did

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:12,080
that and I owe it worked out great all

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:17,020
the time it was the government the US

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,190
government they were they were brilliant

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:23,840
actually is part of the US intelligence

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:25,100
community ironically the sides you don't

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:32,150
hear about because they do their job

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:37,160
right okay so Sousa has the best release

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:39,170
policies and release cycles I'm not I I

00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,410
feel like I can back that up with more

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,390
than just opinion and I per hyperbole

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:50,360
the world of open source is a rolling

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:54,440
world not having a rolling release that

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:58,300
is stabilized means that your users must

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:01,190
always be behind the curve and

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,320
tumbleweed solves it in a way which is

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,550
infinitely more elegant than any other

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,910
rolling release

00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:12,850
having an open source release which is

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:16,030
stable enough to run in a server

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,010
environment I believe is an extremely

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,300
important aspect of a Linux distribution

00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:24,700
and deploying that piece of software in

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,180
such a way that enables users to get to

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,000
know Souza and get to know what an

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:34,420
enterprise and an extremely stable souza

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,110
environment feels like is a smart

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,850
business model to help drive revenues

00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,850
and that's another thing that impressed

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:45,220
me about Souza is that unlike all but

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:50,140
one other Linux distribution you guys

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:53,200
are profitable and growing and I've

00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,960
become increasingly wary of trusting

00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,100
open source software which seems to be

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:03,220
on a on a revenue dead end and a lot of

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,840
it is a lot of it is certain pieces of

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,760
software which have an extremely high

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,800
amount of hype and have raised hundreds

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,600
of millions of dollars make no money

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,530
still and it's terrifying and is making

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,370
it hard to raise money

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:21,210
oh it's getting easier now for for us

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:28,120
because we make money it helps

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:31,210
okay so OBS is brilliant and again

00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,840
that's a huge part of that pitch is to

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,880
emphasize that so when I introduce Linux

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,400
operating systems to somebody I say look

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,950
the most important part of a Linux

00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,590
operating system is its packages and its

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,130
package manager that is the core of the

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,740
operating system and how well those

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:54,100
packages and its package manager are

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,720
managed is a direct reflection on the

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,870
quality of the distribution and the

00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,800
quality of the release and you guys are

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:07,150
doing that right it is not a cumbersome

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,210
mess unless I was explaining that it's

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:13,530
got Perl in the background but whatever

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,530
I can overlook this

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:23,650
because I endorsed Julia earlier okay um

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,700
let's see

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,500
open QA is amazing your packages are

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,930
brilliant

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:37,070
your release policies don't suck you

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:40,370
solve the to distribution problem you

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,650
guys stick to your guns and it took me a

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,590
long time to admit that pac-man was no

00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:53,170
longer the world's best package manager

00:25:45,590 --> 00:26:00,110
I think it's zipper now so in a nutshell

00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:06,020
thank you for making such a fantastic

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:12,080
lytx distribution and for making my life

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:16,100
using linux easier and richard brown is

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,880
absolutely fantastic alright any

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,410
questions comments arguments rebuttals

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,820
if anyone honestly wants to argue with

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:29,450
me then that would be great since I just

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:35,720
told you oh you're the best yes what

00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:38,630
feature requests do you have so what as

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,400
much as you love what opens is doing and

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:46,430
what suzer guys are doing helping out

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:54,140
etc what what's the itch that you would

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:56,120
love scratched I in all honesty I'm not

00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:07,370
sure mostly because you take such darn

00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:07,860
good care of my software that I write we

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,980
could prob

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:17,370
see a few more I des packaged but I use

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,690
K develop so I know my credibility just

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,690
went down um

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:29,250
that's German right okay any others yes

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,670
yeah first of all thanks for this

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,650
brilliant talk I'm sorry I have to rain

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,660
on your parade I can agree to many

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,610
points and maybe it's just because I'm

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,510
still on my journey and only halfway

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,200
there

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:46,410
I'm have a red head Fedora background as

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,450
well so I joined Sue's last year you are

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,309
already one year ahead of me basically

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,360
you have two years of Susi experience

00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:56,429
right about one okay okay I will admit

00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,559
when I introduced Sousa to people I do

00:27:56,429 --> 00:28:00,929
introduce it to them and say something

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:08,220
along the lines of Souza's brilliant as

00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:10,080
of about two years ago okay so the only

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,360
thing that I cannot agree on is build

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,110
systems because basically all business

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,390
sucks

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,660
there's just some build systems that

00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:21,240
suck less than others and my question is

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,299
what sucks so hard them out about koji

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,460
so in the defense of Koji I haven't used

00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:28,260
it extensively for a few years mostly it

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,730
was user interface being very very

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:35,299
cumbersome but my um and and also that

00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,559
their entire build chain and supply and

00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,620
package management chain is spread

00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:43,350
across a lot of different areas but

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,090
again I haven't done a lot of work with

00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,970
the Red Hat build system in a few years

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,400
so that's that's also why I probably

00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:53,880
shouldn't have said anything negative

00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,620
about koji setting it up as a nightmare

00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:02,490
but I'm sure setting up OBS isn't a walk

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:03,610
in the park either okay

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,360
I will happily

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,360
within the stage

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:17,180
