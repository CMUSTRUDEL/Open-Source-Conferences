A little over a year ago I found myself doing the Distro Dance. Trying to decide which Linux distro to use for a new datacenter deployment. I was starting to question my old solid choice, CentOS, and decided to go with SUSE.
Join me as I go over my journey to SUSE, and why I am now convinced that it is the best Linux Distro out there today.
Also see how I am convincing people to switch to SUSE and abandon the old ways of Linux for the chameleon.
