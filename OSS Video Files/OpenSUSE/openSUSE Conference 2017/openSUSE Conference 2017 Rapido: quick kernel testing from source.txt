Test kernel changes in a matter of seconds using Rapido - a glorified wrapper for Dracut and QEMU.

This talk will walk through the process of taking a kernel source repository and turning it into a testable VM.
For those who would like to play along on their own machine, please bring:
- a laptop with openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed installed
- Kernel source (mainline master)
  - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
- Rapido source
  - https://github.com/ddiss/rapido.git

After covering a simple standalone test procedure, the walk-through will then move on to kernel testing alongside network accessible storage such as iSCSI, and also touch on some debugging techniques.
