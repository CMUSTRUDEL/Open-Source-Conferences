hello everybody we are here talk about

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:20,820
the open build service roadmap or less

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:23,970
talking out the past and somehow about

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,359
the person on also David I hope that the

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,500
closed feature right so we are Moises

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,540
and David we work together in the OBS

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,870
team that is called build service team

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,750
right we work from Canary Islands so we

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,320
are here now just for this the

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,350
conference I mean yeah I want to show

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,559
you a little bit another view of OBS for

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,539
who know doesn't know how it works all

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:57,539
what it does so we are now taking a look

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,070
at the phrase that we have in the web

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,370
page for there will be a service that

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,869
say that we are as generic system that

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,600
can build and distribute binary packages

00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:13,400
from sources in a reproducible automatic

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,390
and consistent way right so this is a

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,720
very big phrase right so I can show you

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,570
how it works more or less when you are

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,040
just a packaging along in your house and

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,250
you want to package something and

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,930
distribute to some users out there you

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,540
have yourself and then you have to build

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,170
something maybe in the simple case for

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,119
one architecture one format of the

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,130
package for one distribution this is

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,009
just one build if you change something

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,790
you only need to rebuild and send it

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,549
right but what if you want to have more

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,290
users there and then you have to I know

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,960
have more distributions more

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,110
architectures and more packet formats

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,899
right so that will be a lot you will

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,719
keep crazy right because it's each time

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,240
you change a coma because you are but

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,200
fixing something then you have to be

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,420
like 30 things so that's why obvious is

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,110
to the rescue we do it automatically we

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,250
can repeat

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,860
we'll do it so done you you are winning

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,370
you don't have to build the things by

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,940
hand

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,350
that's the would point of it yeah we are

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,170
talking about another structure a little

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,570
bit because the obvious server part is

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,090
divided in two applications right now

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,500
one in Ruby on Rails the other in Perl

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,600
if you are a user you can deal with our

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,400
system by the web UI so using a browser

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,410
or you can using the common line

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,920
interface that is always C written in

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,650
Python right these deals with the API is

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,230
actually separate code in our code base

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,650
that we want to already mix but we are

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,280
knit those talk to the bacon and get the

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,520
big the builds down and the things up

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,430
okay

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,260
now maybe we are sharing the time so

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,180
Dave is your charm hi everybody

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,360
let's talk about the evolution of of the

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,220
components of obvious so at the

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,110
beginning we support of course your own

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:24,239
distributions and also all of those

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:29,070
that's with us into your own public on

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,500
public obvious instance we are supported

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,110
in all Rio dates all the versions of all

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:39,000
of those and we distribute to all all

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:43,290
people so now we support the package

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,670
format like aspect from rpm DS from

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,970
Debian and also like give Ian like

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:59,030
builds after we support also collects

00:03:50,970 --> 00:04:05,519
and rpm butter pizza and from lighter

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:07,410
also up image a snap the support

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,780
architecture in your own instance for a

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:15,329
long time we support almost 40

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:19,169
architecture and now we only have 10 of

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:22,890
them the most of most of and you cannot

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:25,730
do recognized art like Intel RM and

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,090
PowerPC

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:32,580
the outputs we have packages

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,150
repositories and also TV Clippers of

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:41,730
course support of providers most of them

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:44,940
like I saw written machines Dockers and

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:49,410
we also provide bundles like app image

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:54,270
and snap so the last main feature will

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:57,360
pass you moisÃ©s yeah again here then

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,560
talking about the less features in the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,230
last year right so we have improved list

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,110
for cool oh that is here not right now

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,050
the loading of the profile page before

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,180
was many Lister that loaded all the

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,840
records all together and then show it in

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,570
JavaScript

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,810
then you can pack it in a Don now it's

00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,840
server-side so you only have to load the

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:25,350
things that you need right talking about

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,280
a big big feature because his key

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,230
B is yes you can have Bill descriptions

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,980
on build from it so you already know

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,770
maybe key B so also we have the multiple

00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:41,190
thing that is popping out in the UI now

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:44,880
is now you can have in one source

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:48,210
container a description of which files

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,070
are creating which binary packages out

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,610
there so you can see in the right side

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:57,230
that you can have both Bill results so

00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:00,510
you can see what's going on with each

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,169
also the chippy cheeky and the SSL cert

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:06,690
you can now download it download it via

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,540
the UI so you have a dialog here and if

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,650
you have whoa for each you can see a

00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:16,110
button for the lobby this is something

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,270
new also then I don't know if if in our

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,570
public instance is shown now because

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:24,270
there are some dots there and but we

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,490
have image to plate so is that means

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,430
that you have a package with a all set

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,460
up with a key v thing there and then you

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,190
can just branch from it and work and put

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,310
your stuff on so you can just ranch from

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,490
those templates there

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:48,530
create your appliance right now they'd

00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:49,880
be okay the future we have having a

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,889
workshop to think of what we'll have

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,620
what you want to do future to what you

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:57,290
want to change what what with your child

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,590
so the first one is refactoring

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,750
changeable by why because it's old not I

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,919
will show the welcome where we I and we

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:10,370
saw is old-fashioned Aries like why so

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,400
for first we have to meet at the test

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,919
suite not right now we have many tests

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,360
and we want to change to r-spec not

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,090
because we meatus is bad but we have

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,960
smoke test what you can only click and

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,180
visit the page and say oh it worked fine

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:34,570
you have which file with which tests on

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:37,550
maybe a gazillion of code then and also

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,070
the only test of a workflow workflow

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,169
then undo me test then I'm sorry don't

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,250
give me you need test or controller

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:48,610
tests only workflow and that's enough

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:53,300
Andy needs a back-end to run this test

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:57,950
our tech support is more modern but not

00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:01,310
more better but it new we try to we will

00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,780
try to model smoke test to have small 5

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:11,870
with test property done all properties

00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:14,360
reported in these files and independent

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,570
tests and no need to begin thanks to the

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,050
VCR

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:24,370
now we also try to increase the coverage

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,630
with one of your goals because right now

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:34,350
we have been 89% and we tend to reach to

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:37,660
maximum possible the front end we have

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:42,100
looks almost new technologies like view

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,630
react maybe also do it in vanilla

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,630
JavaScript we don't know

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,180
and also new frameworks for Stacey from

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,540
CCS like Miriam semantic UI

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,210
Bulmer foundation we don't know we have

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,550
a look at them and when we start we saw

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:02,290
one of them or something new up here and

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,690
we will see why like I said you before

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,930
is all passionate we have all frameworks

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:14,140
from GS and all framework from CCS like

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,890
bento and because is not responsive we

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,680
want

00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:21,730
now also in twos and AZ merit has

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,030
monitoring like influx DB to measure the

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,430
number of user we have also the opening

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,970
closed reviews the package that save it

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:38,470
updated to have a collection of

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:44,740
statistics and to have more data then

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:47,080
now is Moises part ok we have informant

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,950
days we have earnest and on top of it a

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,470
notification system and we want someone

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,890
get rid of this so it's gone right now

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,870
now we want to have another notification

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,020
system better than just sending emails

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:07,060
and that's why we are going to base on

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,280
reviewing Q thanks to culo again and for

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,380
what for having at least push your

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,900
message instead of pulling because now

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,300
time popping QA for instance just poles

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,060
there also we want to have better

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:23,170
filtering for just not saying I want to

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,780
be just notified if something pop-ups in

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,450
a package alignment in your own but also

00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,120
I can say all in that project or

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,190
I want to have it in the case of

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,180
something so many conditionals and many

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,580
other kind of filtering right beside

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,700
that we have a think about having

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,950
frequency like before and also having a

00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,140
digest instead of just sending a

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,840
notification each time so something that

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:53,440
maybe once they have all the things

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,750
inside and then you just read them we

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,870
want to have more channels even so not

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,840
only email RSS so maybe others we have

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:04,030
to be our what but the good thing is

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,670
that based on a message bus we can just

00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:11,830
talk to it other tools not only app it

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:14,220
for people right and this is one big

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,170
theme for us is just creating something

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,840
that helps people to deal with the Kiva

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,580
files why because this is an XML you

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,550
don't know the options that you can have

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,300
in each attribute so the values that you

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,170
are doing well or not so you don't have

00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,930
any clue if you don't read the

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:36,070
documentation right so we want to help

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,480
people to do it easily supposedly so we

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,770
are doing something visual

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:45,040
inside the obvious and this is since

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,460
it's pretty view is yes because before

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,120
we have TV creating docker images but we

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,870
wanted or needed just have native

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,040
support 4k video files right so we can

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,750
now create I hope in not no time

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,250
building native Dockers from the Kerr

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,440
files and that's it maybe we are now

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,810
talking about a little bit not talking

00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,600
about all this point into other talks

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:21,150
that are all holding here for related

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:24,940
somehow to obvious and so now we on the

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,460
NBA's web map for so you have lost the

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,720
repulsive little reproducible bills from

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:34,150
Berber not because it positive or not

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,550
maybe I encourage you to go to the

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,800
continuous integration of with obvious

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,690
with a bamboo service of maryland's

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:47,330
or in Christian and also to the

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:50,450
associate package hub from Wolfgang also

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,070
on Saturday we have all of those I also

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:57,320

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:06,040
very interesting and also by the obvious

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:12,800

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:17,180
