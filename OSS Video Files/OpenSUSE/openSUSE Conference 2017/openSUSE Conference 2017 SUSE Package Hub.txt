How to get open source packages into SLES

SUSE Package Hub is a project to collect openSUSE packages built for SUSE Linux Enterprise in a central repository. The policies for this repo are aligned with SUSE in order to maintain supportability of the main OS, making the packages "safe" to install and use. 

Packages maintained for SUSE Linux Enterprise exist in many different individual projects - in particular the "devel" projects. Many of these packages would be useful for SUSE Linux Enterprise customers but some of them could interfere with functionality and supportability of the SUSE product if installed. The risk of breaking supportability makes it difficult for SUSE to recommend these community maintained packages to end customers. At the same time, SUSE encourages community efforts and wants to promote the community based packages to all users.

This talk is about presenting the idea and concept of SUSE Package Hub and the current status of the project.

	00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,350
okay thank you okay so well

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,090
about Suzy packaged up I'm wiping

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:27,550
angular I'm working for pseudo Linux and

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:32,770
today I want to introduce you to open

00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:37,800
source packages for enterprise but first

00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:41,320
I want to introduce you to Bob let's pop

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,989
pop is an enterprise user so he's

00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,550
basically using SUSE Linux Enterprise

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:56,199
Server 12 for example as you can see

00:00:48,550 --> 00:01:01,870
here the amount of packages is somehow

00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:03,909
quite limited and put a bot Bob figured

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,630
out okay there are more packages there's

00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:15,250
more software than that is already owns

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:16,930
less so he's he sees the potential of

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,000
the open source packages that are

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:28,390
available and he was thinking okay I

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,780
want to use for example T max so he

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:36,340
looked or he searched on on slash and he

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:40,780
couldn't find it so he was searching for

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,899
T max so this is just an example you can

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,299
take any other package so what he did is

00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,630
basically he went on software openSUSE

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:56,189
org because he was lucky enough to find

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,189
packages that are built 4/12

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,719
but when

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,530
he clicked on the show unstable packages

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:06,979
he kept this message which is like for

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:10,009
our enterprise customers like hmm it's

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,450
I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure if

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:16,780
I really want to install this package

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:20,480
because the message is just telling me

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:26,569
probably not a good idea because what

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:30,099
Bob is looking for is this so everyone

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:34,040
who is using slash is are there any

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:37,130
using slash one two three

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,900
Hey more than I thought the others are

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:45,590
openSUSE yeah good so this is basically

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,519
if you go to just and then you get all

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:55,040
the modules and the extensions listed

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:57,590
available to your system okay and here

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,959
is for example also suits a package up

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,359
but I will come to that later so this is

00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,680
basically the view the enterprise

00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:12,459
customer has and expects because there

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,459
is no other source of packages basically

00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:21,530
so what does package hub um before I

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:27,530
dive into package hub I want to show you

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:31,370
a diagram this shows the amount of

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:34,910
packages in server distributions so on

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,670
the left you have less 12 this is around

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,290
like between I don't know something a

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,180
rough is this is just a rough guess

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,280
around 3000 packages then in the middle

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:51,010
you have open to the leap which is

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,709
around 9,000 packages and then you have

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,790
Factory which is like above 11,000

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:02,810
packages so if he owns less you don't

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,769
have that that huge variety you have an

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,359
leave for example you are armed you can

00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,510
only use the packages that are available

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:14,110
either on slash

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,269
or if you are brave enough you can just

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:20,709
use packages that are in the open build

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:24,250
service but this is for the customer

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:27,430
hard to differentiate if this package is

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:33,760
stable or not or if it's a development

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:36,570
package or whatever so what we are

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:43,449
trying to achieve with package shop is

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:45,370
to somehow fill the gap so you have all

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:49,060
the open source packages on deep edges

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,949
in the middle and we are trying to bring

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,870
these open source packages tous les

00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:01,270
ready to use for the customer from one

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:04,539
source and the source is you saw in

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:12,310
slides before from the suzer Customer

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:17,289
Center the current status is that we

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,570
have owns less like 860 packages in

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,240
package hub ready force less so you see

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,020
that we are a little bit far away from

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,400
the goal to get every package in from

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,760
openSUSE but at least we are on the way

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:38,740
so arm package better the package come

00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,430
from or package up so it all begins in

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:47,130
the OBS so we are trying to use the same

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:52,320
source as you have an open SUSE

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:57,370
so OBS is really great for like packages

00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,580
maintainer and for the community and it

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:05,289
has a lot of packages all already build

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,630
also force list 12 but the problem here

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,660
is I already mentioned is this for the

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:16,620
customer view it's hard to find out

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,620
which package is the best forceless

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:26,259
so that's something we want to change

00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:31,300
actually so so the package hub is also a

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:33,849
project in the build service where we

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:43,240
collect basically or adopt the packages

00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:47,680
from openSUSE and we put some with some

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,979
our policies to it to make it easier for

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,719
the customer to see that basically okay

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,909
when the package comes from package hub

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:59,949
I can use that package and there is no

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:03,009
indicator that this is a non stable

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,650
package I mean if the package is in

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,509
package hub it should in theory it

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,229
should work I mean it also can be broken

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,449
but it's a different topic so what we

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:16,000
are trying to do is we are trying to

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,120
follow also like policies you already

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,840
have for let's say if you want to have a

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,270
package in factory because every package

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,419
and packaged up needs to be needs to go

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:32,169
through factory and then go to package

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:37,569
up so there's a kind of process of

00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:41,650
reviewing so that's one big plus then we

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:44,050
also have checks to make sure that the

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:48,550
package in package hub does not collide

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:51,400
with other packages ins less that means

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,610
that for example if you install a

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,500
package from a different source which

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:03,159
you already installed or which is owns

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:05,619
less and it and it update

00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:07,689
package a base package for example then

00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,969
you're probably in some trouble because

00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:12,779
then you can't be sure that this system

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:16,149
you're running is still supportable so

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,399
we want to make sure that the packages

00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:21,550
that's coming from package up are

00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,580
somehow verified that support ability

00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:28,929
for your enterprise server is still

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,389
there and still valid but I also have to

00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:33,550
say this is a somehow our community

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,149
project so it's maintained by the

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:41,829
community and there's no support from

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:45,130
Suzy at first place so that means you

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,779
can't call basically support for help if

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,089
you have trouble with packages from

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,180
package up but there are a lot of other

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:55,509
good sources like you can use openSUSE

00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:00,310
forums mailing lists and we are trying

00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:02,949
to build up like portals to arm direct

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,500
the customers and even that other

00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:07,389
customers help other customers if there

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:15,639
are some problems and you always always

00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:18,389
can file out back so we want to provide

00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:24,040
an easy access for the customer to

00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:30,189
basically arm access the additional open

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:36,970
source software ok I already mentioned

00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:39,240
the policies it's also very important to

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:44,079
mention that basically every package

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:47,649
should get also security fixes and every

00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:50,680
version is still available in package

00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:53,620
hub so basically it's it's somehow

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,839
layered that means that if you want to

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,490
install a special a specific version of

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:05,250
a package it stays there which is can be

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,250
also great for arm dependencies

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,630
one big thing that we have to probably

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,130
discuss in a bigger round is like the

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:18,970
support from the community in the way

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,820
okay how they might help customers or

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,070
arm when enterprise customers

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,070
approaching them to fix some problem

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,830
also the nice thing is that we are

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:41,950
trying to provide four different

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:46,480
architectures so we have basically x86

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:51,820
64 arm 64 we have a 390 and we have

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:56,410
PowerPC arm so just to keep in mind that

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,880
when you try to arm submit packages by

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,250
the way we have a workshop tomorrow we

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,660
are go into detail how to submit

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:07,750
packages to package up but it should

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,850
work for all architectures it's nice but

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,500
it doesn't have to there are a lot of

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:16,300
packages and package help that are only

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,700
available for x86 64 for different

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,270
reasons one reason can be that it's not

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:25,930
fixed for example 490 or it was just

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:30,480
submitted for one architecture so we

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,480
need some community work there as well

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,890
the other nice thing is that it's what

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,810
we trying to be as open as possible so

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,250
basically everyone can just submit

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:48,190
packages there the package maintainer

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,620
developers or even enterprise customers

00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,440
so that basically the enterprise

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:57,490
customer is not only a consumer but he's

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:02,490
only a or also a contributor to

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,490
basically the product he is using

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:15,120
so we are chop your heart working on

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,120
getting more package into package up and

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,510
therefore we are how it is working

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,050
currently is like an opt-in so that

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:29,100
means that if you want to see a package

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,920
and package up or someone else need to

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,820
actively submit this package but in the

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,150
future we are also thinking of like okay

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:46,960
why not just moving the Delta I showed

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:48,400
basically from openSUSE tous les but of

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,130
course this needs to be discussed with

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,380
maintenance and so on because I'm not

00:12:51,130 --> 00:13:01,180
sure if this is something that everyone

00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:04,270
is would like to do so we want to also

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,010
create a wishlist that basically you are

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,780
able to okay if you're not a package

00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,420
share on a maintainer and you don't know

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,610
how to use OBS at all but you are

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:17,440
interested in some specific open-source

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:21,550
package you can just arm send your

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,590
wishes to to the community and someone

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:28,480
hopefully will pick it up and just put

00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:33,430
that package in for you and one another

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,740
one our big goal is to integrate more

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:40,720
with open QA because currently it is arm

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,570
you can't be really sure that the

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,320
package has some problems in runtime so

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:50,650
it might build fine but it might fail at

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,760
a certain place when you install it and

00:13:50,650 --> 00:14:06,510
you run it so we are working on our the

00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:08,070
open QA integration we also

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,210
working on a community support platform

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:15,660
which is basically a it can be a

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,610
four-room or also a platform we can

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,540
facilitate which is already there to

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,520
build up a community for example I don't

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:29,490
know if you are aware of the IBM Linux

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,970
one community who is there's one ok

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,190
great

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,770
because this is like they are doing

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:38,820
basically something similar or at least

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:41,730
they're trying to achieve that it's a I

00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,700
B M community basically around the

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,730
mainframe so for all of you will think

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,970
mainframe is dead it isn't it's still

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,160
it's still there so they are trying to

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,560
bring open source packages Linux

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,890
packages to the mainframe and create a

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,790
community around that and this is

00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:06,090
something we are investigating as well

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,210
like combining the efforts and building

00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:16,710
up such a community in our in a more in

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:21,150
a wider way because the problem they did

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:24,450
it is that basically they told the

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:27,390
customers how to compile the open source

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:30,090
software on the system and install it

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,150
and that breaks or might break the

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:37,010
support ability of us less system and

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:40,500
it's quite important to understand that

00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:43,500
this software should not the additional

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:53,240
software should not break your system or

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:56,610
you stability so that's why we are

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,620
really taking care of like that no

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:03,480
kernel module is getting into package

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:06,270
hub and so on so but what are the

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,730
advantages for the developers and the

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:12,180
community and the maintain us I mean

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:15,480
because currently it more sounds like ok

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:19,910
the enterprise customers are consuming

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:22,699
but on the other hand it's also

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,930
the possibility for every developer who

00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:30,259
is basically creating great open-source

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,930
software to use through this delivery

00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:36,079
channel to reach out to enterprise users

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:41,959
and customers so they can use package

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:46,339
are basically as a delivery channel so

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:49,279
probably you might think about that and

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:53,089
of course package up is free so let

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:56,180
means that every pseudonyms Enterprise

00:16:53,089 --> 00:17:02,060
Server customer can just add package up

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:05,720
it's like an extension and can I'll use

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:10,089
the software there so we have all also

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:15,470
like free activation codes for x86 and

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:18,289
Raspberry Pi arm it's less twelve sp2 so

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,610
if you want to have some just come after

00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:22,220
the talk and I will give it to you a

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,409
heavily in this box so you can try at

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,169
least you get a free subscription for

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,799
one year up with the all updates but

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:42,040
without any support and you can try

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:50,020
package up on yours / system I was quite

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:52,780
any questions yeah there's one do we

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,170
have a way of giving long-term

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:58,390
contributors a long-term slice license

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,300
so they can continue to test the

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,880
packages they're putting the package up

00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,890
because sale wasn't a system ploy and I

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,910
was submitting packages into package hub

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:13,110
and someone raises a bug on that I as a

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,780
community member have no way of testing

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,910
verifying that bug well this is

00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,670
something that we have to discuss in

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:24,190
detail but it it should be possible that

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,980
you basically cater ah there is Scott

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:29,220
he's probably answering so that's

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,940
something we don't have set up

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,100
programmatically yet but it's something

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,760
we're looking into as a first step like

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,130
Wolfgang said today and tomorrow and

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,330
even Sunday I think we'll have some we

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,250
have some one year activation cards so

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,370
you can get a copy you can use this to

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:53,020
register for slash distribution and get

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,910
all the updates for free for one year if

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,470
anyone is using that for a year and then

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,450
the year runs out and they're a

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,510
contributor to the package hub they

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,220
could have simply contact us and we will

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,950
find a way to get you another year of

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,040
support that's something we really want

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,900
to be able to do is help the any

00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,660
contributors to be able to get free

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,310
access to the celeste bits as they're

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:21,960
contributing and testing and supporting

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:27,090
them okay any other question

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,470
okay three are there any plans to add

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,690
applications such as Python pip which

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:37,450
would allow the customer to add in even

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:39,280
more applications through Python well it

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:43,330
depends I mean why not

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,600
I mean if if it's it if it's for example

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:49,810
on leap why not we can do that if it

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,800
doesn't break any other dependencies or

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:56,430
something but this is definitely

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,430
something we can just look into that I

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,560
think there were two in the back I like

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,320
to ask about how do you decide on the

00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,180
priority of which packages will you get

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,080
into package up from leap is it like

00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:16,600
random or is there some schema behind

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,090
that which goes first when you are

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,520
filling the gap between weekand so

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,550
currently it's alphabetical no I'm just

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,500
kidding

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,300
no now currently it's the way that

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,880
basically as I told before it's like an

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:36,610
opt-in solid basically if you submit a

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:39,010
package there it usually gets in and for

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,050
the future I mean it can be different so

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,990
but currently the situation is just to

00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:47,290
submit a package there and it should get

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,350
in as long as it's also in factory okay

00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,440
I mean the other thing is that usually

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,210
if there are security fixes they get the

00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,030
I should get in very fast or very

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:05,560
quickly but despite that just submit

00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:09,270
okay thanks yeah so we do I just want to

00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,530
add to answer his question we are

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,870
prioritizing based on requests so we a

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,700
customer requests for certain packages

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,930
and when we get those coming in we work

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,580
with the maintainer z-- that are

00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,440
maintaining the packages for openSUSE to

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,300
see if they're willing to contribute

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,540
them to the package up so that's one way

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,190
we're kind of prioritizing the wish list

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:31,000
that he talked about would be another

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,890
way if we could have a way for users to

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,570
say hey this package is not there I'd

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,810
like to see it then we have some

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:42,760
but on what the customers our users are

00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,760
looking for a good prioritize that I

00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:51,110
maintain of packaging openSUSE which is

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:54,890
right now in the top legacy module of

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:57,620
slash the Cisco Gangi and my question is

00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:01,850
what is what have what do I have to do

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:05,000
to put syslog-ng in package hub do I

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:10,760
have to wait until legacy is phased out

00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,950
in October or I can do it now well the

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,340
thing is that we already had the case

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,400
that software were just pulled out from

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,010
a module and put into a package hub so

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:27,430
for example docker compose is just one

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:30,350
example so this is something usually

00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,180
according to the policy you would just

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,540
wait because it conflicts with the

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:40,310
module but this is something we have to

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:43,100
we might talk about in detail so if you

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,960
want to weaken just afterwards then just

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,050
talk about that because that implies

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,880
also like there's less people inside

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,650
sources so we have to coordinate it if

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,670
it's possible to just pull that package

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:59,350
before and then we would be able to just

00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:03,980
pull it in package up okay thank you

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:06,830
okay here's another question can we

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,590
submit late packages into package up

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,270
because I maintain several packages

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,090
where I have a different version in

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,320
Factory and in late and the late version

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:21,040
is probably more appropriate than the

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,040
factory one yes you can yes you can

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,769
so what's the update policy let's say

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,779
our package and package have already and

00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:32,090
you want to give it a new version how

00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,789
does that look like so basically you

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:36,320
branch the package and just submit the

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:40,100
new version but to make sure that the

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,080
new version also gets to factory so

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:54,200
basically we have also hold the factory

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:58,820
first policy okay so if there are no

00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,470
more questions I will just end the talk

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,529
and don't forget if you want to have

00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,029
some activation codes just come to me

00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:09,409
and I will give it to you we also have

00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:13,100
the evaluation kit for SP 2 as DVD if

00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:15,279
you like to use DVD ok thank you very

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,279
much

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,009
