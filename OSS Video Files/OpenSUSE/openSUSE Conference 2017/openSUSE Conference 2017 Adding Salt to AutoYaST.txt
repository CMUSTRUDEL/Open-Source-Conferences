Integration between AutoYaST and Configuration Management Systems

YaST2 Configuration Management is a brand new YaST module which offers integration between AutoYaST and Salt. It's no secret that many AutoYaST configuration features can be implemented using some Configuration Management System (like Salt or Puppet). So the idea is to bring together the best of both worlds: AutoYaST will take care of installing the base system (partitioning, networking, etc.) and Salt will configure the system.

During this talk, attendees will see the module in action and will get into the nitty-gritty details as well. Of course, we'll also have a look at experimental features, like Puppet support or SUSE Manager Salt Formulas integration.

Last but not least, we would love to hear more ideas from you and discuss your use case.
