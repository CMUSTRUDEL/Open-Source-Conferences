IoT: Internet of Teams

Most software engineers use kanban boards for task management, often these are physical boards using post-it notes. These physical boards are often great for visibility and enjoyable to use. However they are very disconnected from the digital side of the software development world.

What if we could use moving physical kanban cards to update our digital systems, bridging our physical and digital worlds.

This talk will demonstrate an IoT solution that I designed and built.
