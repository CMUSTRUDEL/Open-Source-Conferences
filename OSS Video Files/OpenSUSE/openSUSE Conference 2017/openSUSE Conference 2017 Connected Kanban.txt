IoT: Internet of Teams

Most software engineers use kanban boards for task management, often these are physical boards using post-it notes. These physical boards are often great for visibility and enjoyable to use. However they are very disconnected from the digital side of the software development world.

What if we could use moving physical kanban cards to update our digital systems, bridging our physical and digital worlds.

This talk will demonstrate an IoT solution that I designed and built.

okay right I'm Chris and I'm going to

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:21,119
talk about a bit of a hardware thing

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:31,679
about actually smart Kanban boards when

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:33,600
things work so most people who use kind

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,640
of agile development methodologies have

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,660
a big board which has Kanban cards on it

00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,730
because in the IT industry we like

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,870
copying Japanese car industry the 1950s

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,149
and certainly where I work we have a

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,610
physical board with post-it notes on or

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,280
used to be post-it notes and that tracks

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,890
everything we're up to in the moment but

00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,230
we also have a virtual world where we

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,969
have issue systems ticket systems and

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,780
they're totally disconnected we have no

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,240
bridge between them so I kind of had

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,189
this mad idea how about no it's very

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,470
common that we present the virtual world

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,049
into the physical world how about if we

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,900
link the real world with the virtual

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:26,100
world so how about the physical act of

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:29,520
moving a ticket updates JIRA then so I'm

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,780
from London and contactless is massive

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,600
in London that's all based on technology

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,380
called RFID so I just ran the thought

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,540
how about we use RFID cards as Kanban

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,880
cards and then we can link them to the

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,640
virtual world and then when we move them

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,450
in the morning and stand up we update

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,270
everything in the virtual world just

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,930
like this so this is our teams boards is

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,520
one of my colleagues in and we have a

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,090
set of Hardware readers at the top of

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,159
our board and in the morning we pick up

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,469
my card tap it on where it needs to go

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
and place it back on the board and then

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,099
that keeps JIRA up to date everybody's

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,119
happy my managers aren't moaning at me

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,119
because I've not updated JIRA

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,980
so how did we make this happen well if

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,680
you can read that's the mark three

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:24,550
hardware I've been through quite a few

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,520
revisions of the circuit hardware but

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,590
this is actually working now so on the

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,770
top we've got an RFID reader module

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:35,350
which is just stock off-the-shelf this

00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,970
little um OLED display which was just

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,520
really handy for being able to do con

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:43,360
fakin you know making sure it's working

00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:48,459
and then if we kind of strip those bits

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:51,220
off we have two core chips so we've got

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,650
a standard Atmel 80 mega three to eight

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,770
which is running the rfid reader and

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,290
that's all programmed in arduino we then

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,300
got over in the corner a Wi-Fi module so

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,940
these watch you'll connect to Wi-Fi and

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,020
it will talk up to a back-end service

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,150
over a protocol called mqtt and that

00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,580
little chip has a whole 80 kilobytes of

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,530
RAM which when you're used to dealing

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,640
with servers with you know a terabyte

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,680
around it's a bit different and that has

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,540
interesting limitations like you can't

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,380
do TLS on it because you physically

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,370
don't have enough space to put a

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,690
certificate chain let alone yeah but I

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,549
want you to encrypt stuff so I do

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,390
actually have aes encryption layered

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:38,610
over the top of any ett so what has you

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,610
now try to do is a live demo

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:27,169
every right so this is it doesn't look

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,120
so great on a 4k display I guess

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:33,360
whatever the resolution is it but this

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,240
is kind of our connected Kanban system

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,479
and at the moment this is really simple

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,810
setup we've got three lanes to do doing

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:53,669
done and I have some cards so in theory

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:55,610
if I touch it it'll move late it's very

00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:06,990
hard cuz I'm in Reverse

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:09,030
okay so quite straightforward and you

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,770
know very act of moving things then goes

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:17,479
and triggers integrations into other

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:19,770
systems the moment is only got zero and

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,030
another thing we can do is actually

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,030
create a ticket

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:51,400
so it's fairly straightforward to create

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:55,730
ticket and push it down to the board and

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,120
now theory nice light here and I can

00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:02,750
touch it and I've now written the card

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:08,350
which is even appeared on the main board

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,350
in 2d and I can now move there though so

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,290
quick demo actually worked as well

00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,250
so

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,250
[Music]

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,800
so kind of we're next I'm working on a

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,280
mark for version the hardware that uses

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,410
the newer ESB 32 chip so massive launch

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,660
of the ESB 30 chip is I can get rid of

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,410
the dual CPUs I've currently got because

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,690
it's got more than one spi bus on it

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,400
whereas the esp8266 at the moment

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,760
doesn't have an SPI bus you can utilize

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,070
so I can't talk to the RFID reader I

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,630
also want to try and import improve the

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,180
integration so the moment only works

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,980
with JIRA and not that well because JIRA

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,090
is a pain in the ass so there's anybody

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,410
from alt a sin and I'm going to add add

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,230
support for trailer I've had a few

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,370
people that mask for trailer support and

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,800
I want to try and open-source more of it

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,140
at the moment I open sourced bits of the

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,420
Arduino code and some of the protocol

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,030
layer but at the moment all of the kind

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,070
of moving stuff around the actual stuff

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,420
for any other board is I have an open

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:28,050
source yet I don't know how much

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:39,530
interest there is so thank you very much

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:42,180
for listening any questions yeah well um

00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,270
so that doesn't it's irrelevant because

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,460
you move the physical card so at the

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,900
moment I mean there is support for no

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,970
people being able to tag into the board

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,040
and saying who's moving it doesn't

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,240
rework very well but you just move

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,000
because you're moving individual cards

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,760
it doesn't matter about who's moving it

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,980
or what's moving it and that that cards

00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,270
individual right I I guess what I'm

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,430
confused though is can't you have

00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,080
multiple cards in one column yeah

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,140
because so how does it know which one to

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,430
move because you're moving the actual

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:17,460
card yes yeah sorry

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,070
so yeah a task is on the board you move

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,740
up you move the task and then everything

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,880
cascades of it yeah yeah well that

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,170
depends on you know what you're doing it

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,610
depends on your neck yes so thankfully

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,270
they're quite cheap only 20 pence each

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,860
and you can reuse them so no it's not

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,240
like you throw the paper right you can

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,480
just take the ink off and putting it

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,480
back on

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,310
how does the initial synchronization of

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,199
the card with the gr works I mean like

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,089
you probably have like a new task which

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:50,250
you put on the board you have to put

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,319
some data manually somewhere or yeah at

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,459
the moment so this is one of the things

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:56,819
I want to improve with integration with

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,290
JIRA kind of ideally maybe have a button

00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:01,560
in JIRA and you can say write to board

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,550
and that does it all or do way else of

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,189
region going to do it is you write the

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,019
card here and it creates ticking JIRA

00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:09,300
it's just that you know I haven't got

00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,660
enough time to sit down and work out

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,449
Hana the JIRA web plugins work because

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,129
they're quite complicated yeah maybe the

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:19,259
other question is probably more like a

00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:22,980
general question related to the Kanban

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,259
itself like you also try to use it like

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,329
completely an electronic like for just

00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:30,000
the Trello be the reason why I ask is

00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,709
that we used to use like a physical

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,389
Kanban on the board then we show to

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,160
travel mostly because of the remote

00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:37,259
workers because that was a problem when

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,389
like helpful the people are not in the

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,209
office it's hard to use that as I'm just

00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:43,860
curious if that works I'm sorry I mean

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,209
yes of course I said and different

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,740
operations I mentioned about presenting

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,680
the virtual world into real world and

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,269
that has two big limitations at the

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,970
moment screen resolution is just

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,790
you know if you have a 32 inch it 4k

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,319
you've only got one hundred dpi and if

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,019
you've got you know my company's cheap

00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:03,389
they won't pay for a 4k display so 1080p

00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,040
you better read the text and let Alain

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,800
JIRA's layout doesn't use all the screen

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,410
etc um you know all these things are

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,759
solvable but also a 4k display it's a 32

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,660
inch is really expensive you're talking

00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,670
about two three grand

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,759
whereas that whole board you know

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,709
they're 20 quid module in parts or they

00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,600
took a lot longer to build them yeah

00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,670
look make some oki things but yeah I

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,350
mean also this doesn't work if you're in

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,339
a massive distributed team it's not

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,879
designed for that that's a different

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,800
problem solve their different way any

00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:39,120
other questions

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:41,040
Thanks but for the remote ease it's

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,199
basically just a representation of the

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,389
Kanban board do you have any plans for a

00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,399
robot arm that actually moving cards

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,550
around

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,129
