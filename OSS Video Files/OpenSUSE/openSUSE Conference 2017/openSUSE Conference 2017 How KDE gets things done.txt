From happy developers to happy users

We often have the impression that while we keep working things don't seem to get solved. In this presentation we will discuss the development process, then will go over what the KDE community has been up to in terms of QA and will bring some ideas so that we can create, together, better solutions.

Alice

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,699
Poe is going to talk about KDE and its

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,180
development process so please welcome

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:32,180

00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:35,730
[Applause]

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,260
well good morning I know it's not easy

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,590
to wake up in a Sunday morning

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,000
especially to go to listen to this guy

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:49,309
so I really appreciate you coming here

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,510
so well back in March or something

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:53,600
Douglas told me about doing a

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,500
presentation here

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,609
openSUSE is always an interesting

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,969
project that has been orbiting me as in

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,489
the KD me for for for a long time and

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,549
well I'm really pleased to be here and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,110
and well to have been here and then

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,590
talking and listening to you guys and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:19,080
while explaining my little piece of the

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,369
the story so for those who don't know me

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,979
my name is Alicia

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:28,650
it can be expanded but you can call me

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:33,110
al ish I am in the kdv board for a pin

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,920
for three years now I'm uh

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,689
professionally I'm working for blue

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,210
systems where I work full time

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,250
developing different KD technologies and

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,560
well usually I used to work mostly on K

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,990
develop and KDE do applications then

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,350
when I was hired to do blue system stuff

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,030
I started doing more plasma things and I

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,600
started maintaining discover which is

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,240
our Software Center for the snow and I

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,159
come from Barcelona which is an ICD by

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,479
the Mediterranean where we're running a

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,250
meetup group called person office over

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,530
which is sponsored by openSUSE and I

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,819
thank you for that it's really really

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,510
nice for us to have

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,730
your sponsors and what it's pretty cool

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,829
also if you are ever in button Barcelona

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,859
I want to listen to about to talk about

00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:25,290
resolver we might be having a

00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:27,689
presentation of these days just pop by

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,780
and well see what's what you can always

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:37,139
ask us and worst case scenario we can go

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:39,540
for a beer so like I was saying Douglas

00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,040
told me let's talk about KD and one of

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,010
the things that I've been doing through

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,109
my whole involvement in KD is thinking

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,040
about the development process process of

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,980
some what sometimes with my k develop

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,989
hat right like you're making an ID what

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,609
do you give to the user so that they can

00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:02,579
develop things for or develop KD further

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:06,540
right like k develop by its vision is

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,939
not something that should be for KD

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,400
project right but on the other hand we

00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:14,669
understand that many KD developers are

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,290
using to develop us as an ID so you

00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:20,069
might just as well want to have things

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,780
integrated properly on our hand I've

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,359
been a maintainer for different projects

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,689
for several years and I've been thinking

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:30,930
about how to do how to deliver good

00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:34,530
applications on different platforms for

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:37,049
example one of my involvement like I

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,500
said was KD at you that means kaljaa

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,389
bruh for me which is a tiny application

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,989
mass application I worked on when I was

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:48,000
a student back then and actually for the

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,769
last five years I haven't developed the

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
application itself that much but I've

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,329
been reporting it to Android but

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,439
actually I started porting it to the

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:01,859
Nokia n900 then the n9 with all of the

00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,609
changes that all of these meant but in

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:08,909
general being able to have the to keep

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:11,099
in mind the use case of a person who is

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,340
carrying a computer in his pocket is

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,699
kind of interesting I think I don't know

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,120
in the other hand with my involvement in

00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:24,779
plasma we've been thinking about well

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,710
how how do you get somebody like to

00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,960
spend here

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:34,110
or her free time in in well working on

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,919
something so sensible like it can be

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,539
working on on on a shell or well tools

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,090
that are kind of part of the operating

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,770
system depending on what is your

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,720
definition of an operating systems I

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,729
mean so to get the question out of the

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,169
way how to get things done well we

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,569
basically have developers which

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,759
basically mean coders designers and

00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:03,300
Slater's we need we need to get together

00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:05,520
to work together and well do things and

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,990
when I say do things I mean that right

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,289
because we have very different products

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:15,900
in kitty-kitty we start to being a

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:18,240
desktop but nowadays we have what we

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,280
have a desktop which I which now we call

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,699
plasma and but we also are doing

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,860
different things and what we need to

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,139
accommodate all of those because they

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,430
are all very important right you need to

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,889
be able to offer a solution for for the

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:42,840
people who want to use Linux and to come

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:44,719
one to be efficient when when they have

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,509
a lineage and a free software

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:50,520
alternative when when they work but then

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,469
to actually get things done they would

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,960
want to have applications right I mean

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,639
to be able to start applications is not

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,139
everything you need to do with with your

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
system you need to well manage your

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,020
files you need to well have a text

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,440
editors you need to have but many other

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,860
things and what we were also developing

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,840
these and possibly one of the things

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,610
that make special cadiz special there is

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,400
that we don't really think our

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,180
applications as something that should be

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,949
always used by my plasma desktops but

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,179
it's something that will always

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:30,689
integrate properly with plasma

00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:32,520
but it's not necessarily a requirement

00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:36,239
right most of our applications would

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,249
work on any Linux this well desktop

00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:42,019
environment but they will also work on

00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:48,089
Windows or OS eggs or even Android right

00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:50,689
and we also create frameworks which well

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:55,439
normally there are byproducts of our

00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:58,699
applications and and desktop environment

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,539
but it can also be something that people

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:05,459
can third parties can can use and

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:09,209
leverage and we're really happy to know

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:11,879
they're doing so so we're working on all

00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:15,719
of these products but how do we deliver

00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:18,899
them but currently we're delivering

00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:22,199
turbos which is something a bit weird

00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:25,050
but well we've been running it doing it

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,529
for the last 20 years and it kind of

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,409
worked

00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:33,329
right but in general it helps us it

00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,339
helps us get things to the users because

00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,529
while we have some users and actually

00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:42,479
when any KD developer if you ask him

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:46,110
with the doing he suffer for it what's

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,379
doing it for for for the user so we'd

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,990
like to think about them but it's not an

00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,419
actual true thing that we have users

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,979
actually you have users that you're

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:03,179
getting the KD software to you and other

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:06,740
right and and actually one of the things

00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:09,329
that I would like to discuss in the well

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,229
not today but in general in the next

00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:16,979
months is how we can solve a bit this

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,990
this kind of all different it's it's

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,300
looking a bit tiny so you maybe don't

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:24,149
get to see it very well but the idea is

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,459
that well you know very well that graph

00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:28,019
we're delivering things you will giving

00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,809
you tar balls and you're getting these

00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:33,810
turbos to the user there's some kind of

00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:35,279
feedback that should get to the

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,029
developer that we need to make sure that

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,930
it gets there I don't know if you think

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,100
that

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:45,750
the whole process is working properly I

00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,130
think that there's possibly things we

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,870
can do to improve it but well it's

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,570
something that that we can definitely

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,730
discuss and and make sure that we're

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,220
actually doing the best thing possible

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,510
because in general one of the big things

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,020
that have been important for free

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,150
software has been its ability to reach

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,160
out reach back to the user and to

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,050
integrate feedback it's it's something

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,890
that we need to make sure we keep tight

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,990
um beyond the the whole how get things

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,450
done I would also like to go through a

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,910
bit the the kind of things that we're

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,620
thinking about when well when a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,510
developer sits in front of his computer

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,120
what kind of things he's thinking about

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:38,360
um so what I will say a list of things

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,360
and I hope well it makes sense to you

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,810
while we've been working on desktops for

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,990
for 20 years we as in KD not me

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:53,510
personally I I was very young when it

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:57,800
all started not that young but oh well

00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:00,840
everything is still changing a bit like

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,680
the keynote speaker from from yesterday

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,720
pointed out it's not like everything is

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,060
changing per se right it's like more

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,790
like we're adding things to the PI more

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,270
than we're getting while different use

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,000
cases but I think that what any

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,130
developer what he thinks about is not

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
about how well he's doing with the

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:28,920
things he has but well what things he

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:32,940
should be doing better so well first

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,220
thing we were used to having a computer

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,950
a definition of a computer used to be

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,000
something that has a mouse and a

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,440
keyboard right and a screen but actually

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,900
mouse and keyboard was something that

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,410
was quite defining on on the whole

00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:51,430
desktop experience but but that's not

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,820
true anymore you can you will

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,400
most often have these and then sometimes

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,560
you have touch and and not always like

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,280
you can have some systems that won't

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,470
have a mouse most definitely and

00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,940
different kinds of keyboards sometimes

00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,060
keyboards that are actually on the

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,280
screen which is like a bit of a bridge

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,100
between the two worlds

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,630
well it's something that somebody

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,970
thinking about how people are going to

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,720
be using computer needs to think about

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:27,670
we're also not always even sitting when

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,820
when using a computer which is also

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:34,870
something that is it's quite interesting

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,350
how if you think about the big trends in

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,030
the last 10 years of first there was the

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,400
phone which was actually the whole

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,410
opposite of of the desktop computer and

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,060
then everything that has happened in

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,980
between

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,140
well since then has been quite on an

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,240
in-between with the exception of watches

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,180
and actually watches I don't think they

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,220
have been all that successful in any

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,550
case nobody is really efficient in their

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,970
what I would say so it's maybe kind of

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,650
out of our scope but in general there's

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,860
a spectrum there's not really like

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,560
different kind of devices and well it's

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,780
something we're thinking about and it's

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,240
most definitely somewhere

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:21,720
free software should and could be doing

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:25,030
a much better work and similarly to

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,690
input devices screens have changed

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,640
completely

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,760
we used to have more or less the same

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,820
screen a bit bigger a bit smaller but

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,680
not even that much right but now we have

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,980
different very different form factors we

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,790
have this tiny one three four five inch

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:46,300
of screens and we have set up with big

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,820
screens and and actually many of them

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,820
and that's actually quite quite common

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,640
and many Dean's in the densities if

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,940
you've bought a computer in the last

00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,120
three years maybe you decided against it

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,920
but most laptops today in the market

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,739
will have different densities

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,420
which means that you need to make sure

00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:09,799
that all of the applications will

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,639
integrate properly with your hardware

00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:16,459
and well it's something that we have

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,369
worked on and who could possibly be

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:22,910
doing a better word but I think but it's

00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:24,649
quite they're somewhat some extent I'm

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,869
sure many of you also have problems with

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:33,410
this so what that is welcome another

00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:35,329
thing that has my supply chains is what

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:39,949
the kind of of processors even that

00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:42,319
people are using we used to have x86 on

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:44,269
all of the devices and well just my

00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:46,970
smart people in the in the crowd will

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:49,339
also tell me and we still have x86 on

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:53,389
all of our devices but interestingly

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:56,779
like we've seen that whatever used to be

00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:59,629
x86 is still kind of always x86 and then

00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,959
we've all gotten these kind of devices

00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:07,189
all of us and then all of these are not

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,989
x86 but they're armed right from a C++

00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,939
he will is something that shouldn't

00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:12,699
matter at all right like you should just

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:15,589
be using the right the right compiler

00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:18,169
problems should be solved but but in the

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,889
end I'm pretty sure this has been one of

00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:24,199
the one of the things that have stopped

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:28,129
us to actually properly flourish in

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:30,379
these other platforms right we're used

00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:33,860
to spending our free time in actually

00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,410
compiling things locally that run on our

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,579
computer testing things but doing the

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,309
whole testing things on different

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:42,919
devices is something that is is a bit

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:47,480
harder for all of us there's many

00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:50,239
different alternatives that try to solve

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,569
this issue but in general we're getting

00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:56,779
there actually if you're interested I

00:14:52,569 --> 00:15:00,470
was working on it on on on K develop for

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,819
the last month actually I wrote a blog

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,309
post about it if you're interested you

00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:07,429
can you can take a look but in general

00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:11,839
my message here is that everything was

00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:13,910
x86 and it still it is a x86 except for

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,029
the fun hardware also yesterday we had

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,670
the presentation about how there's all

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,310
of these bow

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,710
words that we could be using actually us

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,370
as Kady would be super happy to tell

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:30,980
people yeah just take one of these

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:33,000
keyboards and and just zip or insult

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,480
plasma in it and it will go work

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,490
perfectly but I don't think we're really

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,470
there yet in terms of supporting the

00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:46,890
hardware especially much of the

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:49,710
accelerated harbor is well not not

00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:53,210
working properly and what on a desktop

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:57,390
that people are interacting very very

00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:02,100
one-to-one you want to have the best

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,870
experience ever right and also another

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,850
difference is that we used to have just

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:11,040
the one system right well in the let's

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,110
say 2005 I used to have my email

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,450
configured in my system and that was

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:19,290
everything I needed I had all of my

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,850
configurations there it was fine it was

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,920
everything I needed today

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,990
having a system configure doesn't mean

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,180
anything right you need to have all of

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,880
your information accessible to all of

00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,800
the devices it's something that we've

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,620
been working on for example from from

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,620
Katy Connect and I think that is it's

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,960
it's something that we haven't really

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,030
completely solved yet I mean we've done

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,520
improvements but we are not at the place

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:52,980
where we can say well we're at laser and

00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:56,240
another big difference is that since we

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,620
have different devices and actually not

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,170
all of the operating systems are

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,900
available to all of our devices we'll

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,670
always end up having just different

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,420
operating systems on every different

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:13,020
device so saying I'm going to only work

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,670
for Linux I don't really think it's even

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,560
that much of an option right I mean it's

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,270
that much of an option if you want to

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,470
solve the problems for Linux but if you

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,290
want to solve the problems for your

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,440
users you need to think in a broader

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,060
spectrum on well how will they be

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,070
communicating whenever they're in the

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,460
walk or where how will they be

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,700
communicating where

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,350
when they're sitting at home because if

00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,960
we don't do that it's going to be others

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:41,800
doing these choices for us namely well

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,140
Google Facebook which are doing very

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,000
good products there and well they're

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,400
clearly competing with us and we should

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,830
be possibly doing a better job at that

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,570
well and possibly another another big

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,340
change we're seeing in this whole Linux

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,110
world is that we used to have all of the

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,500
software coming from the distribution

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,320
which was our whole security model so

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,870
far and it looks like it's not going to

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:11,830
be the same for for Gen X for the next

00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:14,980
year right so what we need to keep in

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:19,420
mind that this is a situation that we're

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,540
going to be in in the next well 1/2

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,150
years and we need to be ready we need to

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,710
push the technology to be able to speed

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,080
to make sure that we're delivering

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:34,480
quality products like we've always done

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:36,220
and now well we run in circles as in I'm

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,460
not going to actually run in circles but

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,440
what I want to transmit to you is this

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,900
all up everything is changing and

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:50,620
we we have so much work to do what we're

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:53,440
doing but well takes time so how are we

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:56,590
doing it how are we going to solve all

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,020
of the problems have been outlining here

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,750
well first of all we have kit and we

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:06,100
used to have kid when we started 20

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,960
years ago most of the problems we have

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,230
today what most of the problems I

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,240
outlined there it's problems that every

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:19,210
cute user has even cute as a product has

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,830
it right like input devices it's

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:25,240
definitely something that if they've

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,550
cared about different different screens

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,070
different number of screens it's it's

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:33,010
all problems that need solving and and

00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,040
well we're not alone on that which is

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,960
always a nice thing we also have

00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,110
kirigami Kagami is a framework we

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,680
started working on for like a couple of

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:47,970
years ago I would say maybe when I

00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,350
but the idea is that when you're writing

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:53,030
an application you don't really want to

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,010
think you want to be able to think about

00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,110
other form factors right and well the

00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,940
framework we used to have up to the

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,820
point where it began well frameworks

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,650
where y-you can technically run the

00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,710
applications on other operating systems

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:10,350
it just looked really horrible right so

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,630
her kirigami offers us the possibility

00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,860
to design applications that will work on

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,990
different form factors and which is kind

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:23,430
of what we're doing where for example

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,830
discover the supper center I wrote it

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,840
last year to use GDG AMI

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,730
and actually out of the box it worked on

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,210
the on the plasma phone which is which

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,880
is kind of cool another interesting

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,800
thing about Kagame is that when if a

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,020
developer comes to me and says I want to

00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,700
work on an application that is weren't

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,900
going to work on a phone I don't have to

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:49,980
tell him well choose between while

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:54,060
working on plasma desktop or Android

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,680
right because because actually I would

00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:00,080
say it's kind of one of the big problems

00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,080
that the whole free software mobile

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,660
community had right like all of them was

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,730
we're really open but if you wanted to

00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,710
get an application there what you really

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,520
had to go through all of their set of

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,900
requirements well their own set of of

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,910
library they depend on the whole set of

00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:24,030
API is a use that were like coming from

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,710
a higher level of existence while they

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:28,800
were while doing mostly things that we

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,890
already have today like part of the

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,830
reason why you will possibly not see any

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,220
Gaede application on the Yola market for

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,460
example

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,680
Yola is based in cuit right but it's

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,520
based on a cute version they froze at

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,500
some point in history and while we

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,530
cannot stop all of our development

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,650
because they're in an old version so

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:55,320
together kirigami different ways to

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,730
distribute application can possibly a

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,400
Jedi's

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,980
all of that Whelan is also something

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,020
that is coming it's something that we've

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,970
actually it already feels a bit like a

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,860
joke right like Waylon is going to solve

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,130
it actually I don't know if it's a thing

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,770
here on openSUSE but well in plasma

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,840
meetings the Waylon is going to solve it

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,110
it's like yeah all right you're

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,460
me

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,919
but we're going to have Weyland like now

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,460
actually one year ago you could already

00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,950
test it with with plasma today you can

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,450
test it and even be happy when while

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:37,049
using it other desktops are are doing it

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:40,080
as well I think gnome defaults to Waylon

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:42,450
nowadays so that's pretty cool

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,750
Waylon is not important because it's the

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:50,309
new cool technology Waylon allows us to

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:52,710
target a much minimum minimal much more

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,110
minimal set of dependencies that will

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,390
allow us to run an operating system on

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:01,260
on a system right like the amount of

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:03,720
drivers that are required to set other

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,419
device with with x11 is actually quite

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,250
huge and well as as soon as you start

00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:12,660
thinking about not desktop devices you

00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,840
really want to start scratching things

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,030
from from the very beginning and I will

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:24,260
and actually like delivers quite whether

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:27,270
it simplifies a lot the picture of how

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,940
little test of environment works so

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,820
that's pretty good and in the in the

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,049
same line we also will have Holly really

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,780
soon

00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,760
I really like the project that's why I

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,160
put it here maybe it's not such a big

00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,790
deal but what the idea with valium is

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,669
that most hardware vendors today are

00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,190
really caring about Android when they

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,110
want to get the device into the market

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,880
right and it's not like they even care

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,330
about Android that much right they won't

00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:03,000
even give support on the device for that

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:06,620
long if we expect these people to create

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,430
drivers specifically for for the Linux

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,840
all-school kind of things

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,120
well we're going to be disappointed

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,510
actually as a community we've been

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,580
disappointed repeat repeatedly I mean

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,440
not even the Raspberry Pi which is like

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,530
the coolest most free software hardware

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,610
over there isn't delivering a super

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:31,270
polished solution in in this front so I

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,850
think that there's definitely well room

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,690
for improvement and what-have-you

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,340
malphur does is to say okay let's not

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,720
bother asking all of these people for

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,720
permission to use their hardware which

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,820
is what it ends up being these asking

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,700
for things but just getting whatever

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,070
they're delivering to - for Android and

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,140
seeing if we can reuse it and well

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,130
there's being there's been quite some

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,770
success now also Hallam is a

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,840
conglomerate of a couple of of

00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,700
communities that wanted to solve this

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,060
problem and are solving this problem

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,050
together

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:09,630
namely plasma mobile and a couple of the

00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:15,310
Ubuntu phone

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:16,510
well Forks let's say and what they're

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,250
working together they're doing things

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,020
and I think it would be pretty cool if

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,600
somebody had Susan popped up over there

00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,680
and said hi guys we're doing arm things

00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:30,430
and we're awesome

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:33,100
let's be awesome together and then well

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,320
changing the subject what we were

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,270
talking about before when I was telling

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,640
you all of the new requirements we were

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,490
having and what we're saying seeing a

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,620
peer for the last few years most of them

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,210
it meant there's less more more

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,800
complexity right like there's a lot of

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,560
complexity that we didn't used to have

00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,900
and now it's not even part of the daily

00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,780
thing it's something that is required

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,480
for most of our many of our users to

00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,730
have a successful experience when using

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
their computers so it needs to be up to

00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,350
speed right so we need to have a good

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,410
continuous integration systems that well

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,890
test things on one side having

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:14,440
application run tests locally that's

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,770
something that we're actually like very

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:22,450
actively pushing our developers to do

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:23,230
including myself but well it's something

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,020
I'm pretty sure

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,270
are also executing as packages of our

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,620
applications which well if you're not

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,150
doing bad boys

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:35,980
and then there's open QA I am with the

00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,690
Sousa people so I have to mention it

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,570
it's it's really cool every time I see

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,820
the the project I really want to use it

00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:46,330
more and then I start wondering why I'm

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:49,480
not using it more I don't really have a

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:53,740
good answer to that though if you have a

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,419
good answer you can tell me I don't

00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,280
really know what's missing so that we

00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:58,870
integrated properly in the whole

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,480
development process in KD I know that

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:07,090
you guys are testing KD things with

00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,260
plasma but well communication like I

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,950
said in the beginning it's something

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,390
that we need to sort out also we need to

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,100
make sure that it's actually part of the

00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,750
development process right something that

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,900
I can represent that I can reproduce

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:24,340
well having an iterating process is

00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,590
something that is super important at

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,559
least for me also obvious it's obvious

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:32,940
is one of these projects that in Academy

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,260
for the last academies or annual event

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,860
it's one of these technologies that keep

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,840
popping up and I'm not super sure why

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,580
we're not using more I think that we

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,570
probably want to use it more I'm not

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,669
super sure why not

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,710
I guess I could tell you my personal

00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:51,220
experience but I don't know if that's

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,570
super relevant here but in any case I

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,240
think that we want more of it

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,330
we should have more of it let's see if

00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:02,549
we can find ways where it actually makes

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:07,059
sense because in the end is mostly about

00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:08,980
getting the developers in the right

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:10,059
space where they can actually start

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,179
producing right

00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:16,330
I mean developer is these developers

00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:18,429
this we're kind of asset that I mean

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,799
he's either quite idle because

00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:24,760
developers also like to drink beer watch

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,919
movies but if they have all of the tools

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,620
they need they start producing things

00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,830
and well the easier it is for them to

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,190
actually get things out there and I get

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,220
the feedback the

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,919
more possibilities for them to say okay

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,679
I'm not going to go for a beer with my

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,029
friends and I will say home by the way

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,490
that's an actual conversation I've had

00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:49,429
with many people like why are you doing

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,350
more KD things or these things you said

00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,210
you will do I am going out with friends

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:54,379
because I have an actual life that

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,580
that's something that happens I'm sure

00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:58,639
it's something that happens to you too

00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:05,059
as a well opens to the community right

00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:06,889
but well that's also one of the big

00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:10,340
changes we've seen in the last few years

00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:13,490
is that things is a blooming runtime and

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,889
actually we never I never looked at at

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:20,990
Linux as a runtime right but I mean

00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:23,000
clearly having standard ways of

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:25,100
executing things on Linux it's something

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,659
that the world wants and actually if the

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,549
world wants something the world gets

00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:32,830
something is not something that we can

00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:35,480
really argue about it I mean it kind of

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,240
started by just running things on the

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,360
servers but then a docker happened and

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,639
now Windows is integrating Linux

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,360
executables I mean that that's

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:50,779
mind-blowing is that who isn't mind

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:53,899
blown by Windows running see everyone is

00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,970
so it's it's impressive and actually I

00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:59,149
mean we need to be part of this party

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,580
right one of the things that have

00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:08,360
frustrated me the most in end of my

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:10,669
whole Linux experience has been how well

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:19,009
we we've had the concept of repositories

00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:22,220
in Linux for decades right and in 2007

00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:26,539
we already had had them for decades but

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:29,559
we never had the well the strength to

00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:31,700
come to get together with with a proper

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,759
application store kind of concept and

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,320
actually we are still struggling like

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,259
the solution for that has been the

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,750
upstream project actually and it is

00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:43,220
coming together now maybe let's say it

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,169
was coming together a couple of years

00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,430
ago right but it was very frustrating

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:49,650
for me to see how Apple

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,530
came up with a whole app store thing

00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:55,590
from one day to another and and we've

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:59,040
been struggling massively without being

00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:01,950
n and we've been so slow at giving

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,080
alternative to that because because the

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,750
sad truth was that we were not and user

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,450
oriented enough to be able to to cater

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,620
to that well that was kind of a reason

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,350
for me to start working on a software

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,230
Center so maybe I am feeling a bit too

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:18,570
passionate about this subject or at

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,240
least more than than you guys but in

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,040
general what I want to say here is that

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,350
much like absolute swear thing 10 years

00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:29,580
ago the Linux runtime is the thing now

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:32,160
and well we're good at Linux so we

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,710
should make sure that we make the best

00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:39,870
out of it and I know there's some kind

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:42,180
of well there's fears but well there's

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:46,530
risks everywhere in life like waking up

00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:48,930
is risk but in general trying to get up

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,390
to speed and being able to well deliver

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,780
to people executables is something that

00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,140
is going to happen and well we want to

00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,840
be there and in general with a strict

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,790
plasma hat I think that we want to

00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,910
execute any applications on Linux right

00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:08,730
I mean we do have our own applications

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,700
but we never really claimed that the

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:14,190
right thing to do well see use cute or

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,220
kitty applications on a KDE desktop

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:20,070
obviously they will be some things that

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,160
we get to integrate much better on those

00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:25,860
systems but I mean that's more of a

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,530
coincidence than an actual thing I mean

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,710
well if you ask me how do i how to

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:34,470
develop an application properly for

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,020
plasma I will naturally tell you just

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,380
use cute use our frameworks and you will

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,000
be set for life because they're awesome

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,650
there's people doing some things in

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,110
Linux and I think that it's very

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,030
important that we remember that we want

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,790
to integrate these and actually Luke's

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:55,460
is not even about well old school

00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:58,290
applications anymore right like we have

00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,350
maybe a big percentage of our time let's

00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,330
say 70 80 percent is depends a lot on

00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,340
you guys is spent on the on the web

00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,320
browser and actually integrating the web

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,370
browser is possibly one of the things

00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,309
that we should be doing much better we

00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:18,270
actually have some kind of approach

00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:22,440
there but well it's it's working it's

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:26,580
working progress but in general when we

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:30,500
talk about supporting a better limit

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:33,600
random we also need to remember that

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,659
it's about running applications better

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,429
to make sure that systems are always up

00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,960
to date and to have that we need good

00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:41,610
you guys we need to make sure that the

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,860
user knows what he's installing and

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:46,320
where it's coming from because it's

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,630
actually something that well it isn't to

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,940
be part of the problem but it could be

00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:56,610
now and and to give information about

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,690
what the applications are doing and how

00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,480
they're interacting with the whole

00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,130
operating system right I mean the fact

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,770
that it's easy to insert an application

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,010
it doesn't mean that it's safe or even a

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:10,500
good idea right so we need to keep in

00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:14,460
mind that this is a part of the solution

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:19,260
and well leave the give it the love it

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,639
it it needs and like I was saying we

00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,500
need to reach out to other operating

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,960
systems we kind of think that Linux is

00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,760
everything I mean even Linux is not the

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,190
thing right like Android is Linux but

00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,790
running a Linux application on Android

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:36,540
is quite an impossible task at least on

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:38,399
our on a normal Android phone so we need

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,659
to be flexible we need to learn that

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,080
saying well setting very strict barriers

00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,190
is not going to help anyone I think and

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,490
well it's something we need to work on

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,659
and same different operating systems

00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:57,540
different form factors well we need to

00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:00,720
think about how people will be using

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:03,750
their computing experience what it will

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,300
be and like I was saying why was a first

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,130
class citizen so I don't know if you saw

00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,390
one of the developments that has

00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:14,369
happened in plasma recently was the

00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,880
addition of something module that

00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:18,000
integral

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,269
it's Firefox and chromium or Chrome with

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,630
with a plasma shell like well being able

00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,980
to know at least what tubs are open and

00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,200
that there's also some nice features

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,269
like extracting extracting and priest

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,490
information from from them I think that

00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:37,079
this is something that was sorely

00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:40,289
missing and if we can make good or use

00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:44,849
of it I think that we can we can embrace

00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:49,079
much better the the the users that could

00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:51,329
come on the next few years now how do

00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:57,869
you improve and this how do we improve I

00:35:51,329 --> 00:36:01,619
mean in a straight openSUSE 2kd kind of

00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:03,779
way although it possibly applies to many

00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:06,450
other communities well one of the big

00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:08,549
things is that we need you guys to speak

00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,329
up so if there's a problem if there's an

00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:17,309
issue you should be saying so it's not

00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:19,500
really useful to know that people aren't

00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:21,299
happy but you don't really know why or

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,190
what it's exactly the their their

00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:26,670
pinpoints actually like nothing in

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,660
khaidi

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:32,819
itself is is closed right like any of

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,829
you could go today and go to the plasma

00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,890
mailing list to the plasma IRC channels

00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:41,400
and well speak your mind especially if

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:45,660
you're kind and smiley it always helps

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,500
but actually we encourage everyone to be

00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,049
part of of the conversation even

00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:54,599
Sprint's we host

00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:56,549
well physical in-person Sprint's for for

00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,690
our meetings I think having you guys

00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:00,329
there would be something really

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:04,079
interesting and actually I've always

00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:05,609
wondered why people from from this Rose

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,529
it's not something that is really

00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:09,750
specific to openSUSE but people from

00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:12,029
distres usually don't feel compelled to

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,690
to attend right I mean I have the

00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:17,519
impression that if I was coming up with

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,970
with a product using something I would

00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,650
want to talk to them and to be part of

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:26,339
the discussion and I think that it's

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,509
it's it's something that well it's

00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,480
something that could change and possibly

00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:34,589
would change Hey in the next few years

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,740
so what I did now was to go a bit

00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:39,779
through the bug report it's it's a bit

00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,630
ugly but it's not my fault

00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:48,420
it's bug zilla's but partner fault so I

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:51,450
went through the bug reports of few KD

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,750
components and I draw this nice pie

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,930
chart here we can see the openSUSE RPMs

00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:03,809
is the orange thing on at the bottom

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:07,200
right so part of your voice is what

00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:10,289
developers will hear from from the bug

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,750
trackers because well the discussion is

00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:16,019
not really happening in in mainly this

00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,339
possibly because the conception of

00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:22,440
mailing lists is that you can actually

00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:26,279
are discussing C++ click-clacking things

00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,259
right but well if the discussion is not

00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:30,210
happening happening mailing lists then

00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:32,309
it needs to happen in bug reports so

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:36,329
here we can see that maybe roughly

00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:39,059
let's say 15 20 % of plasma bug reports

00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:40,859
are openSUSE having a very big number

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:44,099
here also it's not very good it just

00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:49,640
means that maybe there's lots of users

00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:51,720
reporting the same bug over and over but

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,000
well it shows there's a presence it

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,809
shows there's there's interest in

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,079
getting things another project we can

00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:04,019
see here is escrita clida is a project

00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,170
that is very actively used outside of of

00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:11,059
or normal comfort zone let's say like

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:14,490
one of the big the big yellow thing is

00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:18,440
Microsoft Windows which is something

00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:22,259
quite unique in KDE projects well

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,569
Microsoft Windows users are making

00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:26,700
themselves hurt in this community and

00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:28,610
this means that their issues will be

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:33,890
part of the fixes that

00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:37,250
and actually is going to have so and by

00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:42,770
the way openSUSE is the butt ugly blue

00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:45,620
thing in at the bottom making sure that

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:48,770
you're a big part of the pie is making

00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,690
sure that you're being heard and well

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:53,540
like I said I feel strongly about this

00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:57,410
cover which is but my project at least

00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:00,110
in plasma and and here openSUSE is not

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:01,640
there the position out there is possibly

00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,780
because it's parts of the unspecified

00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:09,260
which is the big red thing but well I

00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:13,790
looked it up we had eleven bugs reported

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:15,740
in discover for well in the whole

00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,980
history which is about two or three

00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,840
years but still and and my complaint

00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,880
here is that this possibly means that

00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,270
openSUSE users are not really using

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,020
discover at all and I haven't had a

00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:33,350
proper discussion with anyone about why

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:38,180
it's not an acceptable solution and and

00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:42,710
actually this makes me kind of well not

00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:46,040
fun but in the end when when we talk

00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:50,090
about how you would like to communicate

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,860
more it's about first explaining why

00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:55,670
things don't work when things are not

00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:58,430
working making things reproducible like

00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,880
I was saying before I've been working on

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:05,210
a bit the improving the development

00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:09,940
process so that if the users are going

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:12,800
to be having at different but a set of

00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,630
requirements or uses of their

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,240
application in that different operating

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:21,320
systems we should kind of embrace that

00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,740
so I integrated it in inkay develop

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,910
which is our ID and if we have a bit of

00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,400
time actually we were going to have a

00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:32,660
bit of time so if somebody wants we can

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,690
we can look into the the video but in

00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,270
general well you know there's a problem

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,010
also I don't really like all of the

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,760
distros and I kind of think that you

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,210
have the same thing

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,450
have their own bug tracking systems

00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:51,450
making sure that well bugs are

00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,030
transferred upstream and and making sure

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,620
that well developers know everything

00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:57,270
that is going on there it's something

00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,580
important and while you can say well

00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:03,390
everything is open and you can be going

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:05,880
through openSUSE bug reports well

00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,340
remember that we have maybe 15 down

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,450
streams and while they're not all as big

00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:15,810
and awesome as openSUSE but they all

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,920
want to be there right and well we need

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,620
we need to have this kind of feedback

00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:25,770
and we need to have these kind of well

00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:28,050
things going on and well that was my

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,760
talk if you have any questions you can

00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:41,340
have it now

00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:42,950
otherwise I'll show you my video good

00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,830
morning

00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:49,560
so what does no do you spend most of

00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,020
your resources on the actual desktop

00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,660
environment or are there certain

00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,940
projects certain applications that get

00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,950
more attention than others I know you

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,220
for example you work on this discover

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:03,630
project one of my favorite KDE apps is

00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,040
did you camp but it seems like it

00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:10,260
doesn't get a lot of you know work on it

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,260
so so how does that work well in KD we

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,570
don't set resources actually as a free

00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,640
software community we don't have the

00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:20,550
ability to tell people what to work on

00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,800
we do have Springs we've had several

00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,870
digicam screens for example which is a

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,580
space where we can actually like help

00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:33,150
people get things done in a very

00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:37,190
specific area but in general we don't

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:41,730
tell people to to work on things we can

00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:44,130
well set some kind of expectations but

00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:47,400
that's as far as we get to go obviously

00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:50,280
like for example you mentioned discover

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,860
I'm working discover in my paid time so

00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,190
one thing you could do is to convince my

00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:58,069
boss that

00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:00,020
jicama is the best thing ever and also

00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:02,869
the worst thing ever which means that it

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:05,569
needs improvement right because but when

00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:07,069
things are quite good usually it's hard

00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:08,030
to get developers on them which is kind

00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:10,310
of interesting right

00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,950
at least you need to have people like

00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:16,930
pulling the cart but in general the big

00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:20,390
and direct answer is we don't get to

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:22,099
make thing people work on things we can

00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:25,520
we can try but we don't get to do that

00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:28,760
what we can do is is set some researches

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,030
for it and we actually do and you're

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:37,010
encourage that to help and actually a

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:38,780
bit of you can always help on a free

00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,609
software project I mean I would say a KD

00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,339
project but like any free software

00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:44,810
project and don't even think I am not

00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:47,420
doing that because I am NOT a developer

00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,510
this is not really part of the

00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,640
conversation you can always help doing

00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:55,190
documentation which is super fun you can

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,740
always tell doing drawings you can

00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,859
whatever you're good at doing I'm sure

00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:03,859
that there's well any project can can

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:05,660
make sure that this is useful unless

00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:09,109
it's crochet I don't know that would be

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:12,290
a thing but like PR it's always needed

00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:14,990
actually PR is one of the big problems

00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:18,020
in free software right we need people

00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:20,420
who actually are capable of pushing

00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,810
projects without being the actual people

00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:25,520
doing the features which incidentally

00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:28,599
people doing the features are not very

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,990
good at communicating usually but yeah

00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:34,640
hope you are I answer your question

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,530
ok I've got a question particularly

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,369
about LTS versions so we have an LTS

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:42,980
version of plasma in lis and you know

00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:46,250
looking at our bug tracker um you know

00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,440
it's the largest single component that

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:52,030
has issues you know reported bugs it's

00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,990
higher than even our catch-all other bin

00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:55,700
obviously your graph kind of shows that

00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,099
- in the sense of you know our openSUSE

00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:01,280
bugs are a huge chunk of that pie so the

00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:03,950
kind of the two questions are what is

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,300
really being done to maintain those LTSs

00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,790
because they don't seem like they're

00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,740
getting much love of attention once

00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,410
release they get the feeling they just

00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,420
read run over the wall and what is the

00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,550
plan for future LTS is you know when's

00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,900
the next one and how will be that how

00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:24,050
will that be better than the comic book

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:28,970
yeah good questions so a bit kind of

00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:31,700
like the last answer we've been sending

00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:35,750
patches I send Pudge to the plasma 5.8

00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:39,830
branch last month for discover right I

00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,270
mean things are happening it's not

00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,760
something you coordinate though right

00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,030
like you will we don't have a person

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,860
responsible for four LTS maybe it's

00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:51,380
something that could be useful it's not

00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:54,470
a figure we have at the moment but in

00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,390
general if something is believed that if

00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,840
something a developer believes that if

00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:02,660
they put time on will make a big impact

00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,790
on the user base I'm sure he's gonna do

00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,940
so if you tell me as a Discoverer

00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:11,900
maintainer we have this big big problem

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,190
with discover 5.8 and we need to have it

00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,010
solved

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,860
I will spend time on it right but we

00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:25,580
need to know that this is an actual big

00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:28,490
problem to give some perspective we had

00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:30,440
a huge issue with the latest Kubuntu LTS

00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,410
which actually was not even using our

00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,300
LTS and we also had to spend some time

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,970
on that so it's not really a matter of

00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:40,280
what what is really important about us

00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:43,130
for an LTS is actually that we have the

00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,500
certainty that if we work on it it will

00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:50,840
go to the user because there's nothing

00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:52,280
more worse for a developer that to be

00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,350
working on a fix that might not be

00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,540
hitting the the users and actually the

00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:59,030
what that was the kind of while

00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,860
reasoning behind off of doing an LTS I

00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:06,770
mean people are actually going to be

00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:09,620
releasing this this plasma 5.8 for a

00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:12,890
long time so we can just as well keep it

00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:18,350
awake and if there are things to do to

00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:19,880
have improved well do it now if there

00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,010
are big problems

00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:31,940
well it'll talk to

00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:35,960
I have never heard what escalated I mean

00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,540
it's always a matter of how to make

00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,860
yourself hurt right I mean if you look

00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:45,380
at any projects bug report system you

00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,900
will see a list of crazy problems and

00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:50,090
that doesn't mean that you can take an

00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,140
action on all of them and not also not

00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:56,510
saying that they are crazy problems but

00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:59,510
for a developer it's a lot of time that

00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:03,110
you need to spend to reproduce an issue

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:05,810
on often different platform make sure

00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:09,980
that you can reproduce it fix it and

00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:12,350
then submit it so having some kind of

00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,050
hand-holding especially from from the

00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:17,480
platform to say okay I can reproduce

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,980
this give me a few figs I send you a

00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,050
part I think that this kind of

00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,900
conversation can be much more agile than

00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:29,090
just saying well it's reported there I

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:31,580
mean be happy because well I mean you

00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:33,920
need to know what the actual pain points

00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,380
are because it's a matter of I have

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,200
these resources how do I allocate them

00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:45,470
so I can make my users the happier right

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:49,400
but wait it's a wider subject so it's

00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:52,580
possibly yeah in general though is worth

00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:56,120
mentioning I think that the reason we

00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:59,570
did plasma anthias by private LTS was

00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:04,570
because openSUSE said we're going to be

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:08,900
having a long-term release of of our

00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:11,540
leap and we want to have to be

00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:14,090
supporting what you're offering fresh

00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,520
which I believe it's a very good idea

00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:19,400
right like if we're having a lot of disk

00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,630
of the discussions about how we want to

00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,180
distribute software better

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:26,210
it's because users are not using actual

00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,250
fresh supported versions of software

00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:32,390
right like this is one of the problems

00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:34,790
of Linux today and being able to offer a

00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:37,430
solution was was very good for us

00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:40,010
and actually like for us it's very

00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:42,560
frustrating because the only dish store

00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,290
that peaked as LT s plasma fact that LTS

00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:48,740
was openSUSE right which is kind of not

00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:49,730
fun but well it's not something we

00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,590
really have a say on

00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:55,250
but in general we do want to have

00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:57,800
another LTS I suggest that somebody who

00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,170
is confident with open Souza's release

00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,330
schedules get in touch with the plasma

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:04,130
team and we've discussed about having

00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,350
another one we should definitely make

00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,210
sure that it aligns properly with you

00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,160
guys because I think it's work well and

00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:13,310
actually like not doing so will mean we

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:16,700
will have an LTS release that will not

00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:18,170
have a distribution so well knowing what

00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,960
the problems are is going to be much

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,090
harder or or at least harder than than

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,830
it is today and like you pointed what

00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,390
there's things to be fixed right but you

00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,730
need to have people telling you well

00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,740
this is a problem remember which is I

00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:33,320
guess not a nice work for you guys

00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:38,050
because you know nobody really likes to

00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:43,610
be the kind of butt person going

00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:45,290
fix my thing but well life such is life

00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:49,430
but in general if you want to talk

00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:52,130
further about it we can we can even hear

00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,480
or my email back home I think it's an

00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,960
interesting subject and doing a better

00:51:53,480 --> 00:52:00,770
job there would be really fun did I

00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,430
answer everything you asked so you

00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:08,570
mentioned Cady community is beginning to

00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:13,820
look at open QA uh-huh was somewhere

00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:16,070
about slide 13 I think so given that in

00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,850
the past KD has been criticized because

00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:22,010
in the tarpals and then the Suzy rpm

00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:26,390
sauce packages there are never really

00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:32,060
many test scripts in there I've noticed

00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:34,820
in the latest Suzy sauce rpms KDE sauce

00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:37,370
rpms there are open QA scripts in there

00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,310
which means you're beginning to test

00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:44,000
openly it's an indication you're

00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:45,830
beginning to test openly given the

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,090
thought that there aren't many human

00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:51,540
beings like Zaphod Beeblebrox with

00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:55,160
heads unfortunately a developer and a

00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:58,680
tester tend to be two different people

00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:02,580
my question is what is the acceptance

00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,770
inside the Cady community not maybe the

00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,090
broader Cady community not only the

00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:08,190
developers but maybe you have some

00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:10,860
testers as well

00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:13,200
what is the acceptance perceived

00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:16,500
acceptance current perceived acceptance

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,050
of open QA so I think that we are

00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,930
probably looking at the whole thing the

00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:24,210
wrong way so early on when I define

00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,250
developers I design define developers as

00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,660
sorry who was made the question because

00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,740
I lost you and I don't know where to

00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:34,260
look thank you i define developers have

00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,910
as people who make sava right so I

00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,560
wouldn't say there's first developers

00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,830
and then testers actually what I would

00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,570
diagnose as a problem is the fact that

00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:45,450
what is possibly part of the source

00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:48,210
RPM's you have is not really part of our

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:51,810
git repositories right so it's not

00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:53,700
really part of our franca lingua if you

00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:55,710
know what I mean we need to make sure

00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:59,060
that these things are part of the

00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:03,300
development process that the developers

00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:05,820
can can have access to these things and

00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,400
having access means eating my git repo

00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,110
and these tests is not passing so I

00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,060
don't get the green light I mean it is

00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:16,950
not about reaching out to these other

00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:20,280
community or because like adding

00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:24,030
commuter communication barriers seldomly

00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,910
gets its thing solved so I would say

00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:29,970
that if we want to do it properly it

00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:31,920
needs to be part of the development

00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:34,980
process and the development tools that

00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,160
we use on a daily basis and it cannot be

00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:41,730
part of the source rpms because like I

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,430
said before like there's 20 something

00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,990
packages that appear out of any of our

00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:48,210
releases right and we cannot be

00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,700
responsible for everything that all of

00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:53,160
these discourses in fact one of the

00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,140
problems we are having is that these

00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,960
throws putts random things on our

00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,850
software right which I mean something is

00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,010
sometimes it's done by somebody

00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:04,040
thoughtful

00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:07,340
it's done because it didn't work again

00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,800
somebody was angry right so I think that

00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,520
if we want to have this kind of feedback

00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,500
loop working properly we need to have

00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,940
the same communication space and to be

00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,790
the same in the same communication space

00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,760
it means to be in the same git

00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:27,140
repositories to be in the same well chat

00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:30,290
rooms and and if we can do that I am I

00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,900
am sure that we're gonna see good

00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:34,930
results because because when things

00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,510
start working well is when you see that

00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:42,500
the people who take care of creating the

00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:45,920
software are actually committing not to

00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,270
break things and if they know when they

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:56,260
change something that something breaks

00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:56,260
it's interesting and forth oh yeah sorry

00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:03,109
so both gnome and KDE have something

00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:05,210
like an app store program and the term

00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:08,150
app store also fell in your talk

00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:10,070
somewhere so I was wondering isn't it

00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,320
perhaps time to consider the next

00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:16,609
distributions an app store in their very

00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:19,730
own right especially considering that KD

00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:23,330
and other applications connected to that

00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:26,810
are like delivered within a day or so

00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:30,609
already do we really need KDE app stores

00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:36,800
or genome app stores for that matter I

00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:42,460
don't know I mean with a very KD kind of

00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:46,010
perspective we had KD Luke KD ABS KD

00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:48,020
what did he looking KD apps for 15 years

00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:50,500
they they were there for very long time

00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:54,020
and I have never seen them as a

00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,470
competitor to whatever my district was

00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:59,030
doing right I mean if you want to get

00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,680
backgrounds you want to get I can themes

00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:02,320
it can just as well come from our

00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:07,220
website

00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:10,250
I kind of agree like that these rows are

00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:12,290
like an app store that was like when I

00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:14,450
meant what I meant when I was angry that

00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:16,099
Apple did it was that

00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,809
well we had all of the information and

00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:20,240
we had all of the applications for very

00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,450
long time which is we're not careful

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:26,210
enough to put them into a nice

00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:30,619
digestible user interface that people

00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:34,309
would would be using so now I guess

00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:41,059
you're talking about application stores

00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:42,980
and I think that these stores are doing

00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:45,950
a good job and I don't think it's going

00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:48,799
to go anywhere but the same way we have

00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:52,069
25 distros today and when I say 25 I

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,470
mean probably more than 100 I know that

00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:58,579
people are going to do to be delivering

00:57:54,470 --> 00:58:00,559
applications in in systems that we are

00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:03,020
just compatible with actually what the

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:07,130
distributions are distributing today so

00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:13,309
I think that what is really important

00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:15,200
here is not how CDC's application

00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:17,119
distributors I mean I can give you an

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,290
answer from a very discover maintainer

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,880
point of view but that's not really

00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,500
useful I think that the useful

00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,660
conversation we can be having now is

00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,869
what is an operating a Linux operating

00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:30,109
system today and what are the things

00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:32,720
that we share among each other so that

00:58:30,109 --> 00:58:35,960
we can create solid products together

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,740
without being fighting about the most

00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,349
menial things over and over one of the

00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:45,829
big difference that I see with the new

00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:51,140
cross distro formats that we didn't have

00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:54,559
on the pre cross distro formats

00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:57,170
times is that it's not really a

00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,970
discussion about whether Deb or rpm is

00:58:57,170 --> 00:59:00,559
better you can have them all and

00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:03,200
actually you will have them all like

00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,390
most of you in five years we'll have

00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,790
snaps on your computer you will possibly

00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:09,349
have flat packs in your computer and you

00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,000
will have these draw applications on

00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:12,829
your computer and possibly there will be

00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,839
these trolls that are not distributing

00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:17,960
their software on on applications so I

00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:20,510
think that we need to just acknowledge

00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,339
that things are changing and and see how

00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:23,750
we can work best together and to

00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:26,510
actually make sure that we're actually

00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:29,570
working together truly like

00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:31,280
not adding invisible barriers or social

00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:34,130
barriers but actually making a linux

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,230
that can work on any people's computers

00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:38,960
and actually can solve everyone needs

00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:41,119
but it's not this tool that is really

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:54,800
fun to use when you're SS admin and

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:57,290
you're watching movies at home okay so

00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,420
if there's no much more questions I

00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:02,690
think actually there's no more time is

00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:04,820
there possibly not well thank you very

01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:11,850
much for listening to me

01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:14,130
[Applause]

01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:15,780
and if you want anything you can send me

01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:18,380
an email I'll be happy to answer you

01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,380
