There is no excuse for NOT using continuous integration

Do you work on an open source project? Is your source code hosted at GitHub? Do you use continuous integration or continuous deployment? Why NOT?

This short talk will be about some tricks we use in the YaST team for continuous integration. Because we need a specific environment we use the Docker containers for building and testing at Travis. This approach also decreased out maintenance effort and made the builds more reliable.

Hopefully this talk encourages you to use continuous integration also for your projects.
