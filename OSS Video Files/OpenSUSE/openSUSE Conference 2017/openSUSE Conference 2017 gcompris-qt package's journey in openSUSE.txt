From upstream source code to Leap packaged application

Whenever you are curious about how sources become an installable software in Leap without additionnal repository, or think about contributing to openSUSE project with some packaging stuff, this talk will retrace the journey of gcompris-qt package from its upstream source to the final package that will be natively available in openSUSE Leap 42.3.

I will explain in details the different steps to follow, how to do that, and some receipts against traps. At the end, you will have a good overview of what means get a package to Factory. You also will have a step by step roadmap to make your first contributions.
