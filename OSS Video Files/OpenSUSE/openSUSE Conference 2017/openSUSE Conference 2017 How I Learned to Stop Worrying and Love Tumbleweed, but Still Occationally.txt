Everyone should be running a rolling release, and we should keep making it better


Rolling Releases are the future of Linux distributions. They are already the better solution for power users & developers. Tumbleweed is the future of Rolling Releases. The methodologies, techniques, and capabilities of Tumbleweed are opening up new doors, creating possibilities, and disrupting existing technologies beyond its borders. This session will explain how and why openSUSE Tumbleweed is paving the way for that future, while already being "the reliable rolling release". The talk will dispel the fears, uncertainties and doubts that many have regarding rolling releases in general and Tumbleweed specifically, and share how you can get involved both using, and improving, this exciting fast moving foundation of the openSUSE Project.

But not everything is perfect. This talk will also identify some rough edges in Tumbleweed and suggest collaborative solutions as to how the openSUSE Project could start addressing them, so we can continue the exceptional progress Tumbleweed has made into the future and beyond the year 2020.
