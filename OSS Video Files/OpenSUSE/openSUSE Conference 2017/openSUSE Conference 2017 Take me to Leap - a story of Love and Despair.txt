The journey to bring some packages into the official Distribution

Having a project that builds nicely in OBS is one piece of the story. Taking it into the openSUSE Distribution is a different thing.
On last years oSC the Leap release manager (Ludwig) approached me 'Why dont you bring GNU Health into Leap'? Yes, why not? I liked the idea, but had not enough time to spend for the project. 
When the first RC was announced, we had to speed up....and finally made it!
Up to that point there was a steep learning curve. The presentation will highlight the major steps - and why we still struggle with the update project.
It gives an outlook on the upcoming GNU Health Release as well
