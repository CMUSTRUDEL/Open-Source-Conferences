A Hackable Text Editor for the 21st Century

This is a short introduction to the Atom text editor (https://atom.io/). The authors describe it as "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century". It is an open source editor originally developed by GitHub but with large community around.

In this talk I will describe my experience with the editor and highlight some interesting features. I will also briefly mention what the "hackable to the core" feature means.

(You can find some details already at https://blog.ladslezak.cz/2015/12/14/the-atom-editor-part-i-introduction/ and https://blog.ladslezak.cz/2015/12/18/the-atom-editor-part-ii-atom-packages/.)

okay hello everybody my name is swathi

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,850
sources are a member of the yes team and

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,640
in this short presentation I will show

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,490
you the etomidate are some features

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:32,219
which I like so maybe you can write and

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,710
use it the the automa detour is has a

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,420
motto a hack about text editor for it

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:46,260
for the 21st century and let's see if

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:48,870
that's true I have just two slides and I

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,780
will show you live demo so we can see

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,350
how it works so some short interaction

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,590
item is a an open source project it was

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,489
started by github and currently there is

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,689
large community around and yeah it has

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:11,810
many ways how to extend it they they

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,810
think of it as a modern editor which is

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,490
similar is if you look at it you will

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,979
see it's it's similar to sublime text or

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,830
text my actually there is some plugin

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,740
which allows importing syntax

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,979
highlighting the definitions from text

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,400
night so there are some similarities

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:35,790
there focus on both users in a sense

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,950
writers who writes the code or tags in

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,909
the editor and also under programs who

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,450
develop the packages the editor itself

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:49,320
extend plugins plugins write new UI

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,810
themes and so on and they use also the

00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:00,150
term hackable to the core so I will also

00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:01,950
show something like there

00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:09,390
if you want to install it there are

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:12,510
pre-built packages at autumn dot IO just

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:16,110
does download rpm link you just double

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,090
it and install it I suggest to use

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,850
zipper because it has some additional

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,250
dependencies to packages which are not

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:28,490
installed by default Dell just some

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:31,890
small packages so zipper make it easier

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:34,860
or you can bill it from sources but

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,740
that's quite complicated there was some

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,220
hectic project to build in OBS but I

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,760
don't know how it ended I haven't seen

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,160
the packages in OBS yet and as I

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,900
mentioned is extensible over a wire

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,890
plugins

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,230
unfortunately they call them again

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,040
packages so it's kind of confusing

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:59,820
sometimes and that the kitchen manager

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,430
has a command-line tool I a p.m. so for

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,100
example I will present some packages or

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,440
extensions it would like to use them so

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,840
maybe this command which actually

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,930
installs all packages which I like or

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,200
mark is a star so this way you can quite

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:21,600
easily install a bunch of plugins to

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,700
route the route to the base so let's

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,130
start with some demo so you can see it

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:34,200
some nice features and one disclaimer it

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:36,450
doesn't mean that you should draw drop

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,820
your fine-tuned Emacs

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,420
beam configuration or whatever so

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,730
personally I sometimes still use them

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,450
because for example if I want to edit

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,760
just one single file or one small change

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,580
it doesn't make sense to run this

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,280
full-blown editor Dan Ingram is much

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,459
faster so it does not work in all cases

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,640
in some cases using DD always is still

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,640
better

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,319
I

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,180
projects I will switch Sudan because

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,180
some has some some specific features

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:26,060
this is how the how the Automator looks

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:30,000
it's the usual editing area with some

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,060
file navigation and some menus and some

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,770
stuff is bar just like many other set so

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,699
I will show you some interesting

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:43,650
features which makes it somehow standing

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:46,350
out for example I have this markdown

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,910
file which is which means markdown file

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,060
is quite popular these days

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,340
I need use at many places at github

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,560
especially and they write documentation

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,990
in it so as you can see it has nice

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,350
syntax highlighting which is nothing

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,100
usual unusual but it has a nice feature

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:10,430
which is live preview which means you

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:14,180
can easily see the rendered version

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,280
included images and is some nice

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,000
shortcuts you can if you want to add

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:26,479
some some table you just write that and

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,940
then you can easily add some headers

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,700
change the titles and you will

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:36,150
immediately see the result so if you are

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:39,690
editing markdown quite a lot it's useful

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,099
especially if the file has some some

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,380
some huge structure many many sub items

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:52,190
tables and so on so that if you can see

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,190
the live preview it makes it easier

00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:12,520
so if you change something you

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:17,860
immediately see some markers on the left

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:21,699
side green plus it's means it's a it's a

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,580
new code because it takes the changes

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,409
compared to current get checkout so if

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,319
you change something it can it can

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:33,819
compare it with with the current head

00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:36,729
state if you remove something you will

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:41,830
see - if you modify something you will

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:43,719
see orange ballad and this the nice

00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,569
feature is that if you're doing some

00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:50,349
some changes and suddenly you see a I

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:53,530
want DP original text just go click

00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:56,469
click the icon and you can easily revert

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,289
back to the original state or easily

00:06:56,469 --> 00:07:01,780
revert the the removed section so if you

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:04,060
if you are doing some changes and you

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:10,900
want to go back then you can do it quite

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:22,000
easily then it has some nice navigation

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:24,730
like you place a controls

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,050
it will show you the main header so you

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:30,880
can easily switch to the total to the

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,370
sectional you need or you can even even

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,310
override something and it will search so

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,000
we can you can easily find your section

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:43,510
and this indexing works also in a Ruby

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,670
and C++ file or actually any file which

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,190
support this this feature or has a

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:55,660
plug-in for this so that means you can

00:07:48,190 --> 00:08:05,770
navigate really quickly another feature

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:09,880
which I like is is open on the github

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:14,970
feature for example any esteem we we

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:18,820
communicate the wire IRC and sometimes

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:20,950
you need to send a location in a file to

00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,590
colleague like hey something doesn't for

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,650
me do you know where is very easy or how

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,650
its define where is it so usual way you

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,050
would somehow point or need to find a

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,339
file and put it into our see the nice

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:39,909
feature is that you can you can directly

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,620
open on the github and the most

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,690
interesting thing which I actually

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,220
forgot to mention at the beginning is

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:51,250
that every command which is defined in a

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,740
tome is listed in so called

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,790
command palette so if you press control

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,640
shift B you will see this menu and it

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,700
lists all commands which are defined in

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,800
atom but that's pretty nice feature for

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,750
example in in vein there are many

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,030
features but if you don't know them then

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,150
you can't find them oh you have to

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,310
Google and yeah look in the manual

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,400
that's quite difficult here you can't

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:21,160
simply open the list and you can you can

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,220
you can type and it will find it so if

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,200
you right can help you have several

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,790
options and if there is a shortcut you

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,040
can see the shortcut on the right side

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,800
so we can learn the shortcut quite

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:37,730
easily so here I use

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,510
the first one which is the file so if I

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:44,510
press it I will immediately see the same

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,630
file and the same line and at github so

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,210
again you can you can copy and paste to

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:57,080
IRC and actually you don't have to copy

00:09:50,210 --> 00:10:01,310
at paste because there is another option

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,590
which simply copy its directly to the

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:13,430
clipboard so you can just paste it and

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:18,470
that's it for many languages there are

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,960
so called linters that means while you

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,470
are typing there are some some chicks

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:34,840
run behind in background so for example

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:39,500
in in in a ruby if you write something

00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:42,170
like this it will immediately come

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,210
complain that there is some assign but

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,430
unused variable so if you are writing

00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,320
some code and you forget something you

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,110
will immediately see some some some

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,660
wording in the code there are even some

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,880
plugins for example for reverb or backup

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,640
so we put immediately tell you why this

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,130
is there is one extra space or the

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,460
response space missing but actually I

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,980
don't use it because rather I run the

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,200
Eurocup auto correction and it fixes

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,200
this for me and I'm done

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:33,950
and another nice feature is a wired dock

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:38,300
blocker plugin so if you write the

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,070
documentation commands unfortunately in

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,440
the Indus father some some comment is

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:49,160
but if you start like this and press tab

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,250
it will it will immediately search

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,000
further for the variables and you can

00:11:52,250 --> 00:12:01,240
just rewrite the default description so

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,740
again easily document your code without

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,620
writing and copying the the parameter

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,820
nice and so on

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,240
unfortunately this currently it doesn't

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,850
work for Ruby C++ miss I think pipe

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,950
myself a little unfortunately a ruby

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,950
which views NES is not supported

00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,589
you

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:46,080
as I said many many

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,110
supported by plugins so so for example

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:53,010
this Travis plugin so there is this

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,810
small green icon so again the if you

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,470
click the details it will immediately

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:00,690
open the the the lock on surveys so if

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,210
it fails you will see red icon there so

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,850
just clicking there you will immediately

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:15,960
see the log and you can find why why it

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:18,630
failed what was wrong and the last

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,830
feature I mentioned actually it's it's a

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:26,520
plugin which wrote which was written by

00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:30,440
myself in in doing heck week like on in

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:33,450
two days I was able to do a simple

00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,010
things with simple plug-in which open

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:45,090
links so if if you put your cursor on

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:49,530
some bugzilla number and press a

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:52,890
shortcut the back number is immediately

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:55,380
open and it works also in the code so if

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,470
there is a comment in the code referring

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,550
to box Allah it opens this dis box

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:06,900
immediately and it supports many other

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:10,650
like even fade and and the other bug

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,140
reporting boots so just press shortcut

00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:16,260
and you can immediately see what the

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:23,780
feature is about and there was quite

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:35,990
easy to implement so now let's switch to

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:42,740
the heck ability features so the most

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:45,320
think think is this it's a developer

00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,220
tool you are probably very familiar with

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,140
it and it actually reveals how all it

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,649
works because as you can see is

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:58,250
basically the the page inspector from

00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:01,520
chromium browser and a bit actually

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,640
means that that whole thing is single

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,779
web page application running is earning

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,339
inside modified Romeo environment and

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:14,720
all things are done basically in

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:17,000
JavaScript HTML and CSS so if you are

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,450
familiar with these technologies if you

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,029
are familiar with with web development

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,700
then you can quite easily hack on on a

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,450
tome or write plugins and so on so it's

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:32,240
it's quite convenient and yeah this this

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,029
ensured that there are quite huge of

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,610
Dell developers or potential developers

00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:43,459
behind this and that also means you can

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,700
use normal NPM packages or note nodejs

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:48,620
like that Travis icon it does not

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,860
implement whole functionality from

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,570
scratch it uses the DD standard there is

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,230
NPM package and just it's a small VIPRE

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,370
around it so that means the Travis

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,770
communication has been already

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,110
implemented in some package and in this

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,120
case they just very paid and just

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,970
display the icon and and the UI stuff

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,670
but but the core has been already there

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,560
and just used the package so that means

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,770
you can quite easily introduce new

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,980
feature without implementing this stuff

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,980
arrow

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:37,900
so that means if it's HTML which is CSS

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:40,030
that means you can quite easily change

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,850
the you are if if you don't like the

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,770
default or default style by the world

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,850
this is not the default the default is

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,560
dark I use this dislike theme but anyway

00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:55,020
you can you can quite easily change

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,120
whatever you want in the UI for example

00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:02,410
using this navigator you just need to

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,200
find the decor ik class names and so the

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,110
the path put to the widget in the tree

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,260
but basically it's just like changing

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:18,480
the the UI in another page so I have

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:24,220
some examples if I uncomment this and

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:31,240
save then the then the status bar at the

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:33,910
bottom changed the color to black if I

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:39,970
say it but commented and restore it so

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:42,910
yeah another another example is is the

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,580
close icon here at the tabs you can see

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:49,570
that that close icon but maybe you want

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,580
to change the color you want to make it

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,000
more visible so we can quite easily

00:17:51,580 --> 00:18:00,160
change it to red color or even make it

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,530
bigger so now it's more visible and then

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,500
you can just fine-tune make some padding

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,370
at the top so it's it looks matter so

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,040
that's it

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:13,420
so this way you can quite easily change

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,750
the UI and make it make it looking as

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,330
you wish or you can define a completely

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,030
new team if you don't like the the color

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:24,250
schema you can quite quite easily create

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,800
a new one from scratch actually there is

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,960
a some some generator which can create a

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:34,030
template for you so we can create the

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,330
team package quite easily and the last

00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,220
things

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,809
one place above the cursor so again you

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:44,340
can change it to right change the weight

00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:50,049
one pixel is probably not visible so

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:57,850
let's make it this way so so we can you

00:18:50,049 --> 00:19:00,519
can change the Y very easily so and yeah

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,260
that that's about changing the style of

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,070
course you can you can extend the

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,039
functionality by default there is some

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,679
init file which is loaded at the edge of

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:19,630
startup I have just a short example

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:23,769
which defines some some new command so

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:27,490
this defines a new command flip some

00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:32,380
insert which inserts into the active

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:35,110
text editor some some tags for this we

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,470
need to study editor because this is not

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:45,389
loaded automatically so we have to

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:52,559
restarted and then

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:56,249
we can we can see our command in the

00:19:52,559 --> 00:20:02,009
menu so if you started the the text is

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:04,229
added okay having a command is nice so

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:08,339
what about having a keyboard shortcut

00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:11,940
so there's another config file where you

00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:14,989
can you can define your own shortcuts

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,279
either for commands which don't have any

00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:20,519
shortcut assigned or you can change

00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,799
because sometimes maybe you are used to

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,399
some some keyboard shortcut and you want

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,320
to use the same so you can redefine and

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,269
another use case is that maybe some

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,459
plugins conflicts because they are like

00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:38,099
currently 8000 plugins and maybe some

00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:40,469
some somewhere sometimes you find it to

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:43,070
plugins or more might conflict they use

00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:52,650
the same same shortcut so here you can

00:20:43,070 --> 00:21:07,620
define it so with we si

00:20:52,650 --> 00:21:12,210
DRO shift cue restart the editor and so

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:15,390
now whenever we press that shortcut the

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:18,960
text will be added so that's very simple

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:22,140
like how to extend the editor if you

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,500
want put more changes or bigger changes

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,400
it's then it's convenient to start a new

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,080
plugin so instead of changing your local

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,520
configuration you can create a plug-in

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,920
which is quite easy because there is a

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,050
plug-in which generates a new plug-in so

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,480
you can quite easily create a template

00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:54,620
for new file you don't have to start

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:57,290
from complete scratch this is the

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:02,270
Zillah the Mach number opener which I

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:05,809
mentioned earlier the last thing I like

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,460
to show is that if you write plugins you

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:11,750
can write a test for it

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,620
so if you run a shortcut it it will be

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,630
real status

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,870
unfortunately this plug-in was it like

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,880
two years ago and doesn't work code it

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,980
works as you have seen by the test

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,100
doesn't pass in the in the latest atom

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:29,720
but it there's some just initialization

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,350
bug but what I wanted to say just to

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,240
show is that even for your plugins you

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,030
can write integration tests and you can

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,440
run at them at service which I do for

00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,470
this plug-in which is pretty cool

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,929
because for many game or Emacs plugins

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,360
there are no tests no way how to ensure

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:50,870
the day works with atom you can write

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,360
ice plugins and properly tested even use

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,370
a nice continuous integration with

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,990
service so whenever you get a pull

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,210
request from someone put in something

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,400
you can be sure that the oldest still

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:08,630
pass so it doesn't break so this is

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:10,030
really cool feature I like so that's

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:14,210
basically it

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:16,610
because I could continue quite a long

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,520
but I like just to show you some more

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:22,550
most interesting parts the best way is

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,840
to simply download and install it and

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,840
try it by yourself

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:35,870
there are some links but I will put them

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,790
into the slides so you can because I

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,720
already mentioned these in some my

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:44,920
previous blog post so you can there and

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,920
if you don't have questions

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:55,530
any questions please oh thank you

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,869
