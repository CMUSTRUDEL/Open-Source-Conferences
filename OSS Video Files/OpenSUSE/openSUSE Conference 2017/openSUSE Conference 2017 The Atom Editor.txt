A Hackable Text Editor for the 21st Century

This is a short introduction to the Atom text editor (https://atom.io/). The authors describe it as "A hackable text editor for the 21st Century". It is an open source editor originally developed by GitHub but with large community around.

In this talk I will describe my experience with the editor and highlight some interesting features. I will also briefly mention what the "hackable to the core" feature means.

(You can find some details already at https://blog.ladslezak.cz/2015/12/14/the-atom-editor-part-i-introduction/ and https://blog.ladslezak.cz/2015/12/18/the-atom-editor-part-ii-atom-packages/.)
