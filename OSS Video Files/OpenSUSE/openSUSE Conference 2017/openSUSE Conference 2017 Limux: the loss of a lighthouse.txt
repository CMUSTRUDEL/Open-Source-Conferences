Title: openSUSE Conference 2017 Limux: the loss of a lighthouse
Publication date: 2017-05-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2017
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/1458-limux-the-loss-of-a-lighthouse



Started in 200X the Limux was often cited as the lighthouse project for Free Software in the public administration. Since then we have regularly heard rumours about it. Have they now switched back to proprietary software again or not? Didn't they already migrate back last year? Is it a trend that public administrations aren't using Free Software anymore?  Have we failed and is it time to get depressed and stop what we are doing? Do we need new strategies? Those are questions people in our community are confronted with. 

We will shed some light on those questions, raise some more, and figure out what we -- as the Free Software community -- can learn from it.

Foundation Europe and he is going to be

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,750
speaking a little bit about open source

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:32,239
software and public administration and

00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:35,760
briefly touch on Munich's decision to to

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,590
revert back to proprietary so please

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,590
welcome to help welcome him to the stage

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,660
[Applause]

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,970
so hello everybody

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,920
I saw that there was a long queue so I

00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,370
guess some people will join us a little

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,780
bit later thank you very much for the

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,540
invitation before I start who of you was

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:12,150
already involved in Sue's in the 1990s

00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:15,750
anyone here okay so in 1999 I was facing

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,090
a problem at home I had two computers in

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,950
two different rooms and they were

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,259
connected with a Ethernet cable and I

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,000
somehow I got the idea that it would be

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,520
really nice to write an email from one

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,970
of the computers to the to my brother in

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,780
the other room and also both of those

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,179
computers had email programs installed I

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,399
wasn't able to accomplish that without

00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:43,649
connecting with the modem to the

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,160
Internet and then I complained about

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,369
that

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,579
in school and a friend of mine he said

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:54,659
well I have something for you and he

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,250
brought me some Sousa floppies and CDs

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,000
at that time said with that you can

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,780
achieve it it took me several hours to

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,329
install that and then to see some white

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,890
font on a black screen and some more

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,130
hours till I had a graphical user

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,940
interface and I had to learn lots and

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,549
lots more

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,799
during the next months until I was able

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:19,860
to set up a mail server for the local

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,530
network but yeah that got me started in

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,780
free software later in 2004 I joined the

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,209
efforts of e so those of you who were

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,350
already responsible at that time

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,660
involved in that time you are partly

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,350
responsible that I'm here today so thank

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,269
you for that and to the ones to all the

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,510
rest of you I thank you for helping

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,910
others nowaday to join the free software

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,090
movement so yeah

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:48,870
I was invited to talk about the Limoges

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,000
project and the status of it I will

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,860
briefly tell you a bit about the history

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,200
of the project and then I will

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,760
I will raise a lot of questions and I

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,520
hope that you will go with more

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,520
questions than you came and afterwards I

00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,770
will give you a short example of what

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,850
the efforts of II will do in the future

00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:14,450
and the public administrations so first

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:18,230
of all where did how did the most

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,990
projects start in the early 2000s public

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,070
administrations had the problem that the

00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,230
support for Windows NT for workstation

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,820
ended a little bit like nowadays a lot

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,550
of administrations at that problem with

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,510
Windows XP so they had to upgrade their

00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:38,300
systems and unique thought that this is

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,910
a good opportunity to evaluate if it's

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,830
the best way to just continue and

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,680
upgrade to a newer version of Microsoft

00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,440
or if there are other options so they

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,690
did an analysis of that and came to the

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,270
conclusion that new Linux would also be

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,520
an alternative to switch to they had

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,370
long debates lots of discussions and

00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,100
evaluation about that at one point and

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,140
also the at that time CEO of Microsoft

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,510
Steve Ballmer he made a break and his

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,840
skiing holidays came to Munich talked

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,489
with the mayor to convince him that they

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,920
shouldn't do this step still in 2004 the

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,830
City Council in Munich decided to switch

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,799
to free software operating system their

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:25,130
Linux client for their workstations so

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:28,150
that was the start but then already a

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:32,090
few weeks later they stopped the project

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:35,150
why because there was the fear that

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,830
software patents might be a legal

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,030
problem for New York systems and maybe

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,450
because of that they should not switch

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,169
to a free operating system they then had

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,870
an analysis of that problem again and

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,910
the outcome was that it's not a bigger

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,680
problem for them if they are using free

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,140
software than proprietary software with

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,919
the with the software patents so they

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:04,160
decided to continue but that was the

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,310
beginning of regular rumors about the

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:13,450
stop of the rule of the Linux project

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:17,960
it regularly came back so one of those

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,760
reasons why they why they stopped or why

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,130
there were rumors about them stopping

00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,690
the broad check was often connected with

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,790
costs so there were times when when

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,940
people argued that the broad check is

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,330
more expensive than if they are would

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,490
run Microsoft operating system so the

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,520
C's which was at that time in the

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,440
opposition they filed requests to to

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,030
show how much exactly they were saving

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,060
with debt or if it wouldn't be more

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,280
expensive the IT committee at that time

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,410
they made an analysis and came to the

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,500
conclusion that they are saving 20

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,780
million with their project but then

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,830
there was another time then there was a

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,790
study by HP and they said Munich would

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,890
save 40 million euro for the 3 million

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,040
euro if they would switch to Microsoft

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,870
Windows for their operating systems they

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,600
didn't publish that study for quite a

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,000
long time and in the end it also turned

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,550
out at Microsoft paid for this study but

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,040
things like that the connection with the

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,170
costs was a regular thing where people

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,150
said oh it's too expensive

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:31,520
the project will stop they will switch

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,560
back to Microsoft Windows another reason

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,070
which regularly came was the

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:41,620
dissatisfaction of their staff there

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:46,310
their users with the system so they were

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,560
always reports that the users they are

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,750
unhappy with their ité they are not

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,760
happy with the Linux client sometimes

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,470
there were numbers like 20% of the

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,320
people there are absolutely unhappy

00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,570
sometimes it was that 40% of the people

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,980
there were unhappy with the business

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,930
system but it was always something which

00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,090
was very sketchy the public we was about

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,940
that so it was never clear what exactly

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,010
they were unhappy about they had some

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,790
internal reports but they didn't publish

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:19,130
them so it was a they'd ever unhappy

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,620
with some components but you didn't know

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,570
about what and if they

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,050
connected with the Limoges client or

00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,880
with some other components of the system

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,150
there was also a never a comparison in

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,419
the news how those satisfaction rate is

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,669
connected to the satisfaction of users

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,470
in other public administrations I mean

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,550
if in other public administrations 50

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,220
percent of the people are absolutely

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,320
unhappy then 20 percent would be a good

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:48,580
number but there was never comparison

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,930
like that so regularly it was reported

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,479
that people are unhappy and because of

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,880
that they are stopping the project it

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,160
was also sometimes not not clear where

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,289
this if this unhappiness for example

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,930
could come from the organizational

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,760
changes they made at the same time so

00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,590
when they started the process to switch

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,699
to the Limoges client for the

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:12,100
workstations they also started to to do

00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,919
organizational changes in their India

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,530
structure on how the IT works so before

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,930
people had their IT guy at the desk or

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,050
the office next to them and after this

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,300
micro age these structural changes when

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,750
they had a problem they were just one

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,900
ticket in the ticket system that's also

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,000
something which gives people the

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,360
impression that it's it's not so good as

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,599
before but yeah it regularly came back

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,000
people are unhappy that's that's the

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:46,800
reason why a munich will now stop and

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,800
switch back to microsoft windows another

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,339
reason which is also often which was

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,290
also often noted was that munich will

00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,490
switch back to microsoft office because

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,230
of interoperability reasons so they had

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,990
the problem that other public

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,490
administrations they are often still

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,480
using microsoft office and we're sending

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,029
Microsoft Office formats to the

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,520
documents to them and they had a problem

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:18,040
to process them and even at that time

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,170
the the federal government was sending

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,790
proprietary documents through the city

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,120
of Munich and asking them to fill that

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,130
out for for certain things also at that

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,890
time already the federal administration

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,810
in Germany they had a decision that

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,100
every federal administration should be

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,540
able to receive

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,030
to edit and to send back ODF documents

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,310
but it's very difficult of course and

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,110
also connected with the with the example

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,500
before with the unhappiness of the users

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,900
that when you try to tell your users

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,520
that it's the others fault when all the

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,260
others around them tell them it's your

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,580
fault so it's a very tough tough place

00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,430
but yeah that was something which

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,080
regularly pushed the rumors that they

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,670
have to switch back and the project will

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,310
fail and then there was another reason

00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,900
which was nothing so I had the

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,210
impression that when there weren't any

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,070
news about Limoges for some time people

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,800
said oh I heard that they are now

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,460
switching back to Microsoft Windows so

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:25,270
from my experience that also happened

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:28,920
still despite all those despite all

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:34,300
those challenges they have been able to

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:37,090
- of to finish their project in 2013 so

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,740
they have been able to migrate 15,000

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,680
workstations to the Allah mocks client

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,800
and beside that they have also been able

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,980
to to migrate a lot of templates and

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,850
unify those or Deeds office templates

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,560
they also published a software to take

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:57,160
care about this template management the

00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,040
wallbox software so yeah

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,770
they accomplished that and of course

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,080
such a migration it's a very tough

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,970
process with all the organizational

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,750
changes they also were doing and then

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,440
switching an IT system which before that

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,340
was depending a lot on the software of a

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,100
few vendors in this process before they

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,160
always had the support from from their

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,060
mayor and from the political leadership

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,510
Christian wood at that time that the

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,030
mayor who started the project also in

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,980
2004 so whenever there were complaints

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,950
from other departments at least they

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,440
know that the leadership will somehow

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,240
support what they are doing and whatever

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,640
they are facing they get some moral

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,820
support but that changed in 2014 there

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,660
were new elections

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:54,140
and then the the mayor before he didn't

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,990
run again and then the after the

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,880
reelection there was the SPD which was

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,430
also the party of the mayor before and

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,560
C's woulda made a collation and our

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,650
governing now together and the new mayor

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,190
is a detail later who is also from the

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:13,040
SPD but he was already before that not a

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,720
big fan of the deluxe project he was in

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,450
some newspapers before bolded as

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:24,080
Microsoft fan and he also that he was

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:27,200
also very proud to say that he was he

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,030
had an important role that Microsoft was

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,770
moving their headquarters to Munich and

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:34,850
he was very involved in that

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:38,320
he claimed so from that time on

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:43,340
it seemed that Limoges was somehow the

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:46,160
scope scapegoat for everything so let's

00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,650
started with things like the new mayor

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,150
from the CES who he bought an iPhone and

00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:53,240
wanted to connect that to the mail

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,540
servers which were not supposed to to be

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,440
connected with iPhones at a time so

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:02,090
whose fault is that

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:05,510
the Limoges client of course then there

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:08,300
was a mail server outage what did the

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:12,890
media report in media reported that data

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,280
writer the mayor of of Munich said that

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,020
yeah it's Limoges fold and if at least

00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,540
if at least our systems would be better

00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,330
so he was also claiming that this is the

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,680
Limoges is it's a full of Limoges also

00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,730
it later turned out that he mooks had

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,980
nothing to do with this problem so yeah

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,370
regularly in the press you could read

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,900
that people were unhappy and that that

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,360
they now want to switch back they were

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,550
never shy to say yeah we are switching

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,250
back to Microsoft Windows now and when

00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,590
you were travelling at that time people

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,040
all around the world what they heard was

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:51,890
oh Munich switched back to Microsoft

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,870
Windows right so even now when you when

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,460
you meet people they still think well

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,570
they already switched like two years ago

00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,570
didn't they and yeah so that was already

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,550
from from

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,050
the overall picture what people around

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,060
the world think what Munich is doing

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,080
they have already migrated to to

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,810
Microsoft Windows years ago what

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:17,340
happened next was that the that the

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:21,660
government they they paid for a study to

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:24,050
evaluate their IT and people already at

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,510
the beginning when when the study was

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,280
started already said oh it will be quite

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,860
clear what the outcome will be because

00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:36,270
the study was given to essential which

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,090
is it was micros it's Microsoft's Gold

00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:43,080
Partner of the year for I think eight

00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:46,170
years in a row so they thought ok it

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,000
will be quite unlikely what that they

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,300
will say anything positive about free

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,290
software but it didn't turn out like

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,050
that the outcome of the study was mainly

00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,630
that they highlighted organizational

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,550
problems so they said yes there are also

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,230
technical challenges but the biggest

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:09,510
problem are the organizational

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:13,140
difficulties you're facing for example

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:17,640
at that time one of the City Council

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,910
members they said that they have because

00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,700
no central entity can decide when to

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,650
apply an update every entity can do that

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,990
then alone every department can decide

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,750
how to do that they had they had phases

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,700
where they have more than around 10 to

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,860
15 different operating systems and

00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,160
versions they are running and they were

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,170
opera OpenOffice versions from several

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,240
years ago with PACs where people were

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:46,050
complaining about which were already

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,150
fixed for years so yeah they said their

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,100
main recommendation was you have to fix

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,940
those organizational problems and fix

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:58,400
your structure and then it was a little

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:01,500
bit silent for some time again and and

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,100
then there was a surprise motion in the

00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,600
City Council that was earlier this year

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,780
before there was something on the agenda

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,570
about those organizational changes they

00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,550
didn't take the recommendations directly

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,519
which essential was giving them

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,500
they found another not organizational

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,630
structure which she wanted to do but

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,670
that was mainly on the agenda and then a

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,850
few days before the City Council meeting

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:29,670
there was a slight update it was under

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,730
6b new and then they added a few words

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,190
to say that they they have want to

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,010
prepare a concept to move to unified

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:41,130
Microsoft Windows client and everybody

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:44,700
was like what where our supporting

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,070
documents for that we're what costs will

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,870
be associated with that change what what

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,279
blend do you have but there was nothing

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:55,800
it was just those words there so we

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,620
thought that if they want to take this

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,740
decision they should at least take this

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,630
decision with knowing effect they should

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,120
be aware of what they are deciding about

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:11,420
so we get a lot lots of questions like

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,980
how much will that cost

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,350
what dependencies do you have at the

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,990
moment which might not run on Microsoft

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:22,140
Windows client what will happen with

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,780
your IT staff which is now trained to to

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,510
run the free software operating system

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,370
and all the software you are running at

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,760
the moment what will they do will didn't

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,250
just be Windows Microsoft Windows admins

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,630
or what will happen there and we're

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,330
together with other organizations we

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,290
gather lots of questions and then we

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,940
contacted all City Council members and

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,590
asked them to before they take this

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,720
decision that they should answer those

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,140
questions for themselves will ask the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,440
the government what what the answers to

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,990
those questions are and we also raised

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
those questions with the press and to

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,300
our supporters and ask them to ask their

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,600
politicians about that that resulted in

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,030
a lot of questions to the politicians

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,730
there so at the meeting at the final

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,320
meeting everybody of the City Council

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,450
several people from the City Council

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,150
were saying they never had so many

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,919
requests by the public they never had so

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,410
many people interested in what they are

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,840
doing there they got so many questions

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,610
there and also from the press it was not

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,410
just the IT press which was there there

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,410
were also people there from

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,780
with a TV team like investigate Europe

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,390
it's a team of investigative journalists

00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:39,660
at that time also worked on a story on

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:41,970
my dependency of public administrations

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,130
in Europe on Microsoft when they heard

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,320
about that they went there with a with a

00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,720
camera team and recorded everything and

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,919
made interviews so there was a lot of

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:57,570
attention about that and due to that

00:18:52,919 --> 00:19:00,390
attention I believe that the mayor had

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,730
to move back a little bit so he said

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,490
this was never supposed to be a decision

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:11,580
to do that it was just about examining

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:15,150
it and so that's all recorded and and on

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:18,450
video and he said well it's just about

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:23,070
examining we it's not a final plan yet

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:26,280
to do that and during the during the

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,690
City Council meeting the feedback from

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,520
the opposition there were people they

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,799
were very outraged that this was just

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,960
put on the agenda a little bit before in

00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:40,710
a sub node just adding a few birds there

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,650
so in the end they agreed to amend this

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,900
decision so they added that this new

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,600
concept should also include like what

00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,179
software will afterwards not be used

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,520
anymore that this is clear which will

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,559
not run afterwards so everybody in the

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,760
city knows in this city administration

00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,490
knows what software they will not be

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,440
able to use they would have to provide a

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,299
rough estimation of the costs at least

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,220
which is quite good because before that

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:08,400
you heard lots of different numbers

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,159
which were sometimes like 20 million 40

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,380
million 80 million or so and I think it

00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,600
would be beneficial if they know a

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,659
little bit clearer on how much money

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,030
they would like to spend there and it

00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:23,640
was added that the final decision about

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,679
this move will be taken in the City

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,289
Council again so that is not a decision

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,250
but it will be decided later in the City

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:35,580
Council so that was the meeting in

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,010
earlier this year but in the meeting you

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,659
could already hear that a lot of them

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,110
they were already convinced that they

00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:42,880
want to go

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:44,560
back to Microsoft Windows especially

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,170
from the CSO and also some people from

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,910
the SVD in their in their comments

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,100
already said I am very happy that we are

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,500
now moving back to Microsoft Windows and

00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,080
and then they continue to argue and even

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,760
now after after those amendments it's

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,800
not clear to the people in the City

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,960
Council what exactly this is now about

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,700
some people think they decided to move

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,790
back to Microsoft Windows other things

00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:10,240
no it was just about a concept so it's

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,600
it's quite some chaos there but their

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,450
plan is now to develop a concept so that

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,790
they can switch all their workstations

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,490
back to Microsoft Windows to one

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,670
Microsoft Windows client till 2020 and

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,160
beside that also do those organizational

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:30,610
changes they decided on that should also

00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,390
have until that time so devs D that's

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,950
the blend at the moment and we also hear

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,170
again that they are now already

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,370
internally preparing some things like

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:44,650
changing budgets and already shutting

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,150
down some services to already move in

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,590
this direction also there was no

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,030
official decision yet and the City

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:55,180
Council did not take any decision but

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:57,190
still I think it's fair to say that this

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,790
is the end of a lighthouse so it's not

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,660
anymore the shining shining example of

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,080
free software in the public

00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,930
administration if it was dead before so

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,830
even so there are people there who do

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:13,390
good work and who try hard to to migrate

00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,190
to free software there and keep that

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,330
running if their boss constantly

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,070
discouraged and sabotage the work

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,240
instead of supporting them something

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:29,110
like that you cannot do that so the

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,290
question is is it all their fault is it

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,750
their fault that they yeah there was no

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,310
political support that that they made a

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,860
lot of mistakes on how toward they

00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:44,160
handle that and is it mainly on Munich I

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:48,070
think that this would be a bit too easy

00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:51,880
and I think that if we have this

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,610
approach we will lose the advantage to

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,760
use this as a

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:59,610
as a moment to evaluate if maybe we also

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,970
did some mistakes like all of us here if

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:06,420
some of us also made things which made

00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,780
it more likely for this migration not to

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:12,390
to work out or also for other my

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,640
creations that they don't work out so I

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,160
would like to raise a few questions and

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,690
I'm very much looking forward to your

00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,790
answers to that afterwards in the

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:29,100
discussion and yeah so first question do

00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,809
we suck a desktop so I mean free

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,669
software it's very dominant in a lot of

00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:35,610
places we have super computers running

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,980
free software all kind of servers we

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,410
have a lot of embedded devices cars are

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,700
now running free software we have them

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,220
in so many places

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,470
mobile phones you have everywhere your

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,290
free software operating systems but in

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,640
the desktop area even a lot of people in

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:56,610
our community are using proprietary

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,900
operating systems there so why I think

00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,460
that's something which we should think

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:05,510
about and if we can come up with

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:07,740
solutions on fixing that it's also yeah

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,390
there could be regression is it not

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,940
about a desktop I mean with our desktops

00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,470
be fine but is it a problem that there

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,230
is a huge dependence in public

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,480
administration on Microsoft Office and

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,940
Microsoft Exchange so it doesn't matter

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,460
what how good your desktop below that is

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,770
even if it's better the those systems

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,100
don't run there so you're not able to be

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,929
able to switch any one could also be but

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,299
then still why also many people in our

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:39,210
own community running our auto operating

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:41,040
system the other question is did we

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,440
concentrate too much in our

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,790
communication to friends and people

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:52,350
around us about the cost saving

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:54,059
so do we concentrate too much to

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,580
highlight that free software it's

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,850
cheaper in the long run and that it's

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,370
mainly about costs there the question is

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,750
like if if we constantly do that also

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,940
with our friends and people around us

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,080
people will often associate free

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,970
software with it's the

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,360
cheaper solution so if I don't have a

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,450
higher a big enough budget I still have

00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,640
the possibility to move to free software

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,220
with this approach people they will not

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,500
allocate enough budget to move and

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,830
migrate to free software migration will

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,890
also always cost a lot and why should

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,090
free software be cheaper than

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,769
proprietary software in the short term I

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,590
mean in the long run maybe yes but still

00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:37,350
this connection with it's cheaper it may

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,889
be creators is that something which we

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,350
can fix by already educating people

00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:46,980
around us that you have to pay for free

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,950
software too when we provide something

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,519
to them we can also ask them to pay for

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,179
that

00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,429
and question is if sometimes we might

00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,860
not encourage people in our community or

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,740
companies that they are charging for

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,269
free software sometimes some people of

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,929
us they are taking people because they

00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:09,870
put a price tag on on free software can

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:11,580
we move a change the perception there in

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:14,760
an other direction if we are more

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,590
regularly charging for it and supporting

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,360
people who are charging for free

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,470
software if it's individuals or

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,740
companies and that's maybe one of the

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:31,590
most provocative do we sometimes harm

00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:33,750
our self by volunteering and that's from

00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:37,320
the situation that sometimes with those

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:40,019
migrations you either have staffers or

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,789
external volunteers who want it so much

00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:47,669
that public administrations or eight

00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:49,350
schools or other other organizations are

00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:51,750
switching to free software that they say

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,330
well I will invest a lot of my free time

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,730
into debt or a lot of energy into debt

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,860
so they start doing that also there is

00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,779
no budget allocated to it and their

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,789
bosses yeah okay I mean you now

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:05,000
convinced me or you you told me about

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:07,620
those advantages now for several years

00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,639
go ahead and then you invest a lot of

00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,799
time and energy into that and after a

00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:15,750
few years I mean you might be able to to

00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,850
cope with lot of those challenges but

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,740
after some time you might face a lot of

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,730
problems and if you don't have a budget

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,280
then too

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:28,380
get help from external people you will

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:32,160
most likely fail so what happens usually

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,930
is that then the bosses they don't think

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,450
like always so the problem was that we

00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,160
didn't allocate budget so that we could

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,560
get external professional help for our

00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,380
migrations but the result is made mostly

00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,000
all so free software doesn't work let's

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,950
allocate some budget and do it with a

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:53,490
proprietary company the right way so the

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,530
question is do we sometimes by investing

00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,330
too much of our time and energy into

00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,880
switching people to free software

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,520
without the appropriate budget harm free

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,920
software in the long run and is it not

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:10,440
sustainable enough if we do it that way

00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,060
might we even have to tell people when

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,590
they won't like to move to free software

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,340
when they don't have a budget tell them

00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:21,690
well don't do it stay concentrate your

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:27,240
smaller budgets on something else so

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:29,010
yeah then another question is did we

00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:33,380
focus too much on the operating system

00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:36,180
and too less on applications and that's

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,760
that's two questions actually in one

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,100
side I think it's it's also

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,230
understandable a lot of people from us

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,610
we reuse our operating system and we are

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,070
very happy with those operating systems

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:51,720
and we would like others to also benefit

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,730
apart from them so we are not that much

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,970
interested in all the other applications

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,230
which public administrations are running

00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:03,090
they are very complicated and often

00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:05,790
boring but by focusing on the on the

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:09,300
operating system is that the right thing

00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:11,250
for the public administrations and then

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,290
to switch the operating system or

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,360
wouldn't they benefit more if we are

00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,100
concentrating more on making sure that

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,370
all the applications in the first run

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,800
will be free software there on the other

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,070
side there was also maybe not a part

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,780
that some people internally of public

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,020
administrations focus too much on the

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,270
operating system so maybe instead of

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,500
focusing on the applications more they

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,470
first started to build their own

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,650
distribution for the migration might be

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:42,870
a mistake might it be better to use

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,180
standard free software distributions and

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,190
focus more on the applications where

00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,890
more people in the in the organization

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:58,260
might see differences and the other

00:29:52,890 --> 00:30:00,990
question is might be is it possible that

00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,650
we concentrated too much on a few stars

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:06,810
and instead a problem in the long run

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:10,890
when you are putting too much of your

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:13,200
arguments in one place so my observation

00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,390
for a long time was when people asked

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,160
like does free software work in public

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,890
administration in general people said

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,710
yes unique and that was the default

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:26,430
answer of many people the problem is

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:29,610
that I mean as we saw in one city it's

00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:31,380
not just a technical component which is

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,780
responsible for the success or failure

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,850
of something but if we always just

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,960
mention a few examples and and put

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,550
projects in endorse star positions that

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,030
might be very harmful for us in the long

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,700
run

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:46,710
and on the other hand do we actually

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,170
still need it we are now in a in a

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,110
situation where so many companies are

00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,540
using free software out there and also

00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,790
public public administrations when you

00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,280
go away from the from a desktop part in

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,530
so many places they are using free

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,660
software free software applications to

00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,840
solve their jobs so wouldn't it be

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,580
better to concentrate on showing those

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,140
examples what you can do with free

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,700
software in the public administration

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:19,920
and not so much focus on desktop or on a

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,990
few examples where they achieve that so

00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,670
yeah now I asked a lot of questions and

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,270
I'm very much looking forward to discuss

00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:30,330
them later with you and I also want to

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,250
give you a short out view what we at the

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:35,040
fsfe want to do in the next months and

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,790
years probably because that will not be

00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,160
a short-term project so we are at the

00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:43,860
moment in the process to start a

00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,340
campaign it's called public money public

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,330
code our belief is that public

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,059
administrations

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,919
and ever software is produced with

00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,990
public money it should be published

00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,330
under free software license that should

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,440
be the baseline and we are at the moment

00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:05,940
starting with that gathering a lot of

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,070
information so we believe that there the

00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,159
default in public administration should

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,679
be that they reuse software again when

00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,019
they developed something that they share

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,820
new applications and all of that

00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,289
independent of the operating system so

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,240
it's not just about software which is

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:22,529
running on Linux it's about software

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,779
which is running on Windows which is

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:27,630
running on Mac OS on Chrome OS or

00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:30,120
whatever they are using we would like

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,460
that to be free software we would like

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,649
them to be able to share software with

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,010
each other it's not about cost savings

00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:40,139
we believe that the ITA will be better

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:43,440
they will be in control of their IT when

00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:45,179
using free software and we think that by

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,169
that they will also give a better

00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:51,299
service to their citizens so yeah this

00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,190
one is a picture this year at the Isle

00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,830
of free software day in February where

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,539
some volunteers they use broad sectors

00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,870
to Pro check this message already at

00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,580
government buildings because we think

00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:05,340
that in this time we also need good

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,380
pictures of the press so that picture

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,909
was already also used by investigate

00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,600
drop in their reporting about

00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:14,909
Microsoft's dependency the other thing

00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,279
what we are doing there is that we are

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:18,750
gathering votes from people who are

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,580
supporting that I mean in that case

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,500
European Commission but we would like to

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,980
have better support like from people

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,639
from companies from from politicians

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,399
celebrities

00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:31,440
so whoever also would they believes that

00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,870
it's more about sharing and reusing

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,049
government's software instead of

00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,840
procuring something again and again we

00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:42,210
are looking for good examples about that

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,059
so not like desktop users but more

00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:48,210
applications for example I mean many

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,639
people heard about about about Munich in

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:54,779
free software but who few knows fix my

00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:56,340
speed so fix my Street was developed in

00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,590
the UK it's a software view where you

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,870
can report problems when when the road

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,370
is damaged and you can help your public

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,960
administration to fix this

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,940
this is meanwhile used in eight

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,380
countries around the world they are

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,720
using the same software it's free

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,510
software you can have apps who to report

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,159
that those are examples which like which

00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,740
we would like to highlight how public

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,310
administrations can benefit from sharing

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,220
this with this example the Berlin City

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,679
just a few months ago they developed

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:29,190
their own software doing exactly the

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,919
same thing it costs 1 million euro so

00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,720
and if you are interested to help with

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,790
that we would be very happy if you join

00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,860
us one of the most important things we

00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,260
are doing there at the moment is that we

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,710
are gathering a lot of data how our

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,360
software procured at the moment how what

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,760
kind of software do they Brooks you were

00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,190
how often do public administrations

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,750
procure the same software again for that

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,520
we are starting a lot of Freedom of

00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,429
Information requests to public

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,220
administrations and at the URL down

00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:01,620
there there are examples for different

00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,250
countries for different cities so you

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,050
can use that and submit it to your city

00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,270
on a lot of countries there are also

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,770
platforms which make it very easy to do

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,660
those requests to governments we

00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,030
documented that when we knew about it

00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,630
when you know about no more added to the

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:21,360
wiki it will not be that much time for

00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:24,060
you to decide to make those submissions

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,120
but in total when all of us do that we

00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:30,840
will have a very good data base for the

00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:33,840
future campaign so before I go with you

00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:37,550
to the Q&A I would like to end with one

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:41,190
quote from my first teacher actually

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:44,030
many small no he wrote it down for me so

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,740
he didn't invent it just to clarify that

00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:50,040
so many small people in many small

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:56,220
places do many small things which will

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:59,880
change the face of the world so every

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,990
action counts so whatever you do if you

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,420
are developing packaging distributing

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:09,060
free software if you are documenting it

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,370
or translating it or if you're helping

00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,070
new users or developers to get active in

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,700
free software all of that it might not

00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,980
seem big at a tie

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,839
you do it but all the different

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,359
activities but all the different people

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,260
together in so many places that will

00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,500
change the world

00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:29,109
so thank you for helping us to change

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,130
the world and I'm looking forward to the

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,130
Q&A thank you

00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:55,040
yeah I thanks a lot I think there was a

00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,930
great presentation and I think we

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,030
shouldn't see it all to negative I mean

00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,370
if they really move back to Windows and

00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,130
the whole administration gets up

00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,050
by a crypto Troian it's much easier to

00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,450
ask the friends from NSA to get a backup

00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:12,380
so I think it's not that bad

00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:14,420
but a side of the jokes two things I

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,480
would like to address first thing is was

00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:20,600
there ever an evaluation whether the new

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,110
operating system by by Microsoft is

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,850
Windows 10 is according to the German I

00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,850
think which keeps for fassl's Cosette's

00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,740
it's called because only the part of the

00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:34,370
information that they are transferring

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:38,750
to a service abroad may already violate

00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:42,130
this law the second thing you're asking

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:44,360
whether we are focusing too much on

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,500
operating systems instead of

00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,430
applications

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:52,520
I think applications is not that what a

00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,110
company wants they want solutions I mean

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,240
in the end of the day you don't want to

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,360
buy a drill machine you want a hole in a

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,720
wall right so I think we as a community

00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,210
should more focus on solutions that we

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,660
could provide not even on applications

00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:11,990
or operating systems was the idea

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,180
Thanks so yeah thank you very much so

00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,520
for the for the first question I'm not

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,080
aware that they did an evaluation about

00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:23,090
that from what I saw there was no reason

00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,760
real evaluation about this move at all

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,860
so it felt a little bit like we want to

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,840
switch to Microsoft Windows because we

00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:32,840
want to switch to Microsoft Windows it

00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,940
doesn't make sense in a lot of from a

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,520
lot of aspects because they also have

00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,040
this goal that in five years they would

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,740
like to be independent of their of the

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,470
operating system so why now focus on

00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,700
migrating the operating systems when in

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,350
five years you would like to be

00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,780
independent of the operating systems

00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,000
that doesn't make a lot of sense but in

00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,030
in general I haven't seen

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,730
any any evaluation there it was not the

00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,680
evaluation of the City Council of Munich

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,210
but it could be more an idea for the

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,370
Free Software Foundation I guess you

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,410
have some lawyers as well who may be

00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,420
able to check that okay

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,920
I'll know that down but err yeah till

00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,660
now I'm not aware of that and for the

00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,210
second edition yes

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,400
you're right it's even better focus on

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,850
solution than on applications that might

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:25,900
even be better than they are calling it

00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:30,210
applications so thank you just to

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:34,270
reiterate what the other comment before

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:36,820
in 2018 like next year we will have a

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:40,440
new data protection law throughout

00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:43,510
Europe which is even stricter and

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,040
enforcing that will even will become

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,890
even harder with Windows 10 or whatever

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,060
so that's definitely one thing that the

00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,950
free software foundation and other free

00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,930
software initiatives should focus on

00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:00,010
when we are trying together selling

00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:03,640
points for open source and yeah that

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:05,950
requires some legal advice I'm pretty

00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,780
sure you do have some some competent

00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:13,600
lawyers but we need to stress that

00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:16,870
message more nog I think yeah that might

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,720
be might be a good thing such analysis

00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,880
often cost a lot of money so everybody

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,350
was interest in that if if you support

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,090
it or if you know other organizations

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,060
which would also interested in debt in

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:31,120
joining this then I'm very happy to do

00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,000
that I think also that there's probably

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,480
there are some there will be probably

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,820
some some issues there as from from

00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,250
everything which you see from the city

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:47,260
of Munich it's it's already very much

00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:50,020
tailored to go to office 365 and a lot

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:54,790
of things which will not not run locally

00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:57,490
at the beginning but yeah I also

00:40:54,790 --> 00:41:00,340
appreciate the call that you give to us

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,710
to to reflect on on what part what role

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,720
that we will continue to play with with

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,670
these sorts of adoptions that come

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,710
fourth you mentioned that this would

00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,180
likely be the end of Munich being

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:15,210
considered a lighthouse

00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:17,500
are there other public service entities

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,570
particularly large-scale ones like the

00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,330
city of Munich that we can now look to

00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:23,650
to to to be that light house at this

00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:26,619
point are there others that are

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,150
investigating from a public sector using

00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:33,430
open source at that kind of scale that

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:37,330
we can now call the lighthouse so first

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:40,960
I don't know if that got clear I'm

00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,760
somehow reluctant about those big stars

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,090
at all

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,280
so it's it's always yes sometimes

00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:51,820
different organizations are doing good

00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,490
things but sometimes those organizations

00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:57,040
then also change for example there was a

00:41:54,490 --> 00:42:00,250
very nice policy from the White House

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,520
last year that all when when they

00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,420
develop new free software it should be

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,099
20% of that should afterwards be

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,339
published under free software license

00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:12,640
very nice policy so that was nice

00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:14,589
example at that time now it's getting

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,790
more difficult with using that as a good

00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:20,410
example it's also for some some

00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,270
organizations they or countries they

00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:24,369
have quite good policies like Russia

00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,290
introduced some free software policies

00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:28,420
China is also using a lot of free

00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:31,510
software the question is do you want to

00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,450
have them as the shining examples of

00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:37,270
free software use I think we should I

00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:39,609
mean there are other other desktop users

00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,010
the the shunned emoji in France also

00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:43,660
from the research from investigate

00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,310
Europe we also learn that they are under

00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,490
prominent pressure from other

00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:51,310
organizations which try to get them to

00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:53,020
switch back again so in general for a

00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,300
public administration which which is

00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:58,359
switching to free software it's very

00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,640
difficult to be on a public spot it's

00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:03,070
also very difficult with proprietary

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,310
software for public administration to be

00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:08,410
in the spotlight so I don't think we

00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,540
should put that many organizations which

00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:13,450
are moving to free software in this

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,400
position that they don't have time to do

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,150
a migration or to deal with their IT but

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,130
that they have to answer lots of public

00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,410
yes do you live a lot of questions from

00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,210
all kind of parties and so on that's

00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,059
another issue which is problematic there

00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,609
but I think we should I think we should

00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:32,029
focus more on lots of smaller examples

00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:34,010
where people organizations did some nice

00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:35,779
things like the example will fix my

00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:37,490
street that's a nice thing where one

00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,680
government started with it and then

00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,619
several others are using it and if you

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,420
if you look for example at the enter

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:46,819
website join up from the European

00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,369
Commission there are regular examples of

00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:51,650
what public administrations are doing

00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:54,289
the free software some of them are

00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,539
better some of them are not so good

00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:58,220
maybe from a free software perspective

00:43:56,539 --> 00:44:03,140
but there are a lot of examples out

00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:05,930
there and I would argue more for pick

00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,490
some examples which you like there and

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,349
we don't even have to coordinate which

00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,720
examples we pick because pick tures you

00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:13,549
like most and then it's more distributed

00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,220
and we have way more examples about free

00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:19,520
software it's not looking like Linux is

00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,710
just used by Munich but people learn

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,480
about different examples from different

00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,920
people so I don't want to tell you one

00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,779
or two examples which you then will use

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,940
search your own they are enough out

00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:33,740
there yeah so do comments first of all

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,960
on the data protection laws I wouldn't

00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,079
be too enthusiastic because those guys

00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,380
at Microsoft ant dump they have already

00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,529
established a fully German 365 with

00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:47,750
telecom so for example if anyone just

00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:50,480
has the problem with data going to the

00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:53,569
US they can claim no we have one that is

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,119
work that's managed by Deutsche Telekom

00:44:53,569 --> 00:45:00,049
it's fully approved by the government

00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:03,140
and so on so yeah there will be some way

00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:04,940
of making this a topic but they have

00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,130
already thought about many of those

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,309
things and other workloads are going

00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,720
into the cloud so I'm sure that

00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:13,640
legislation will also take this into

00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,339
account to some extent on the other hand

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,559
the cloud is a good thing for us because

00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:21,170
the desktop applications are no real

00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,260
reason anymore I'm seeing more people do

00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:27,079
presentations live of Google Docs than

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,180
they are using PowerPoint these days so

00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,900
that's an argument where I think Munich

00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,549
is kind of late in the game they are

00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,740
trying to switch back in a time where

00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:37,890
everyone else is realized well I may

00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,339
only need my iPad my Android device

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:43,289
my Linux device with a browser and I can

00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:45,990
have access to all those things which

00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:48,329
basically also is my second big point

00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:52,619
there is a very popular Linux based

00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:55,710
desktop OS Chrome OS that is market

00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:57,890
leader in the u.s. educational market so

00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:01,529
of course we wouldn't call it a free

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,039
Linux OS it has quite some strings

00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,950
attached

00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,500
but it shows that if someone focuses on

00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,569
the whole ecosystem how can I get my

00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,599
applications to run how can I make user

00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:16,200
management easy locking down systems for

00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:18,720
like students or employees then those

00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,510
things can fly I think it's just a

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,029
matter of fragmentation between all the

00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:26,819
vendors and it's very hard to do an open

00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:30,599
source implementation office strictly

00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:32,630
enforced framework yeah ok yeah thank

00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,630
you

00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:52,180
thanks I have few like notes I'm kind of

00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:56,019
involved in this open source initiative

00:46:52,180 --> 00:47:00,609
in the Czech Republic and what I I can

00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:03,760
see is that always is about the money as

00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:07,029
you mentioned that if there is anything

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:12,130
about we can switch to open source so

00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:14,019
what we can say but I think that even

00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:17,680
you mention it in the end of your

00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:20,529
presentation that it should be more like

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,480
at anything which is funded by the

00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:25,750
government or with public money that

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,069
should be open source or we should own

00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:32,680
the the code or h-2b public domain and I

00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:36,369
think this is what can be highlighted

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:38,440
and it's like one of the reasons why to

00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:42,309
do that it doesn't matter if it's on

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:46,900
Linux or anything else and the other

00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:50,019
nodes are even if like Munich file is

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:52,960
lighthouse we can take it as an

00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:54,400
opportunity to think about the new new

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,279
starts and learn from that

00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,029
and actually this is what we are trying

00:47:57,279 --> 00:48:03,910
to do in the Czech Republic that we can

00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:09,670
learn from not mistakes but what didn't

00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:13,509
go well and the last note is that I

00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:16,869
think that mostly what is discussed if

00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:19,599
it's a anything about open source in

00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:21,809
public sector is that we are talking

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:29,529
about consequences but not the cause

00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:33,519
like for example before we switch there

00:48:29,529 --> 00:48:36,099
should be some kind of a talk or

00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:39,450
discussion about like what what we want

00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:45,000
to switch or do we have enough inputs

00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:47,799
like from the from the sections of the

00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,049
demo departments what kind of

00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,510
information they want to share or what

00:48:50,049 --> 00:48:56,410
they need to share what they

00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,810
I need to work with so for me it

00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:03,340
basically it's that we ask or like the

00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:05,590
government or offices are switching to

00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,910
open-source but they don't evaluate

00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:12,070
inputs for that which can lead

00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:15,820
afterwards to a failure because this is

00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:20,080
not working there's nobody Oh nobody no

00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:23,740
no before this should be in this way so

00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:27,850
I think that if this change that there

00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,590
should be a preparation and that before

00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,980
that migration starts that there will be

00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:37,090
a clear data what is needed or what the

00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,800
department's need then it can help even

00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,760
with the migration and even with public

00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:46,750
opinion okay thank you for for a comment

00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:50,290
I just I I realized one thing maybe I

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:52,870
was a bit too too negative about that

00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,410
because you you mentioned that lis MOOCs

00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:59,290
failed

00:49:53,410 --> 00:50:01,840
I think I mean it's it's a I'm not I

00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,420
don't think that it was a failure just

00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,090
to to glorify that and even I mean with

00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:09,760
the cross with the savings and so on

00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:12,910
there there was at least one one huge

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,130
one huge benefit not so much for Munich

00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,980
but for all the rest of the public

00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:21,400
administrations around the world or at

00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:24,550
least in Europe by them showing that

00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,530
there is another way of doing it all the

00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:30,010
other public administrations benefited

00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:32,950
because in my opinion Microsoft had to

00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:35,260
calculate that in their prices that

00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,270
there is another option and also from

00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,450
those research from investigate Europe

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:43,480
we learned that public administrations

00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,160
got a huge cut in their in their prices

00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,910
with Microsoft when they mentioned that

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:51,250
they might switch to new Linux so even

00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:55,570
if all the rest of it was not successful

00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:57,060
it was not a failure just so to glorify

00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,220
it at that point

00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,349
so yeah

00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,270
i'm mateus so first thanks for your

00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:06,579
great talk and also your great work I

00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:08,500
appreciate it a lot and I want to

00:51:06,579 --> 00:51:11,589
address the infamous desktop and

00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,050
usability issue so I talked to a few

00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:17,740
people that were more less involved in

00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:19,410
the Limoges issue and some quite

00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,960
terrible stories reached me of

00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:24,910
secretaries that just basically couldn't

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,190
work anymore they were running out of

00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:30,940
the offices crying because they couldn't

00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:34,300
do their tasks and one issue in Munich

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:38,290
was that the city failed to educate

00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:40,270
their staff so when you have users and

00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:43,630
you make a big change and even if you

00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:46,210
just change the desktop from Windows to

00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:48,670
Linux and even if you try to look or

00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,200
make it visually the same it's a

00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,510
different usability and you need to

00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,619
teach the people so this is something

00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:59,800
the city failed at entirely and this is

00:51:56,619 --> 00:52:01,930
an important point also for the desktop

00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,780
or the free software in general it's

00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:07,720
about the users I see that the community

00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:10,210
is sometimes very self-centered so the

00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:14,020
it works for me doesn't mean that it

00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:17,530
works for other people and nice example

00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:21,250
I take is email clients there is no

00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:24,490
email client that doesn't suck a lot all

00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:26,589
emails clients suck and there is no way

00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:29,710
than a cat for instance get my mother to

00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:31,589
use mutt because it's not a way how she

00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:36,480
would like to interact with the computer

00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:41,079
so I see a lot of space for improvement

00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:44,619
regarding the usability and if we want

00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:47,380
more people to use the desktop or also

00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:49,990
the applications we need to make and

00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,700
develop them and make them look like in

00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,220
a way they want to interact with the

00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:58,480
computer and this is why I also gets

00:52:54,220 --> 00:53:01,089
Chrome OS is so successful especially in

00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,200
the yes because it just works like

00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:07,980
people want the computer to work like

00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:11,730
and although yes there is Linux or some

00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:13,950
gen 2 below or underneath it's not free

00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,839
software at all but in the end this is

00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,970
something I would recommend my mother to

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:22,140
use because it just sucks less than

00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:24,599
others that's basically my point yeah

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,480
thank you so I I totally agree that

00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,310
there are a lot of ways on how we can

00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,829
improve the usability of free software I

00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:34,700
think it's also partly connected with

00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:37,829
the question I raised if maybe we should

00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,230
we should also encourage more people to

00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:43,470
pay for free software because you can

00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:45,630
use that to get other people involved

00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:49,440
who focus on usability instead of

00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:53,220
implementing mainly functions I am not

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:56,670
so sure if if the linux project if they

00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:58,770
completely sucked at doing like

00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,970
including the users there I mean in

00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,099
comparison with other public

00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:04,859
administrations my impression was that

00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:07,079
they were even better including them

00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:08,910
than in some other administrations when

00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,680
they switch from one Microsoft version

00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,359
to the other and also those things all

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:15,839
change them from one office version to

00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:17,609
the other so I'm not sure on how much we

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,910
should blame them there but it's it's a

00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:22,920
huge effort to help users to migrate

00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:25,440
from one software to the other and it's

00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,200
often er underrated how much resources

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,720
you need for that and beside that I'm

00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,550
very happy to afterwards discuss the

00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,900
usability of email clients and would

00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,700
argue that there are some good email

00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,300
clients which also suck less but yeah

00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:44,700
that's for later I think ok a last

00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:46,530
question anyone anyone have okay thank

00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,800
you very much for a great talk and I

00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:52,770
think I want to address about the

00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:55,859
problem why it's why it happens and you

00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:59,250
move your mic a little bit up sorry yeah

00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:01,140
for me the problem is about educational

00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,990
socialization because most of the user

00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,910
for instance like in my case when the

00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,619
first time I changed from Lena from

00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,410
Windows to Linux the first things that

00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:13,530
are in my mind is well Linux it's pretty

00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:15,569
difficult and how can I install my

00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,660
software I how can I solve the things

00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:19,870
how can I sell

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:22,270
everything but since the software that I

00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,190
working on the only works in Linux then

00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:25,750
well I should to learn then after I

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,930
learned the more I learned and I think

00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:31,000
oh well it's not really bad and it's not

00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,830
really bad and I even can you know

00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,890
sometimes for instance like in

00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:39,220
LibreOffice drawing you can you can I

00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:42,220
can manipulate some some picture to some

00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,710
publication instead of spend a time in

00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,650
CorelDraw in Windows so yeah I think

00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:50,290
maybe because most of the user is not

00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:52,930
from the IT they are okay you should be

00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:54,730
using Linux and like okay well it's like

00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,750
your black screen in the in the desktop

00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,950
and they will be thinks twice before

00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:02,020
when they are growing with the windows

00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:05,800
and they should be think twice to change

00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,100
in another open source something like

00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,270
that

00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:11,890
okay thank you thank you okay so yeah

00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,050
thank you very much for having me here

00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:16,990
again thank you for all your work for

00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,850
free software and yeah looking forward

00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,290
to discussing with you

00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:22,350
[Applause]
