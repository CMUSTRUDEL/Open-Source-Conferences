Started in 200X the Limux was often cited as the lighthouse project for Free Software in the public administration. Since then we have regularly heard rumours about it. Have they now switched back to proprietary software again or not? Didn't they already migrate back last year? Is it a trend that public administrations aren't using Free Software anymore?  Have we failed and is it time to get depressed and stop what we are doing? Do we need new strategies? Those are questions people in our community are confronted with. 

We will shed some light on those questions, raise some more, and figure out what we -- as the Free Software community -- can learn from it.
