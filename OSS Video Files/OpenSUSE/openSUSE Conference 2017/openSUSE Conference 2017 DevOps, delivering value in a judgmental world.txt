Golden Hammers never had it so good

DevOps is one of the Industry's great buzz words. You've heard that DevOps (or ITOps, or WhateverOps) will solve all your development-to-deployment problems and how agile processes can increase the velocity of your projects. But you also likely know that it's not a silver bullet that solves all problems. This session will discuss how DevOps helps, what the pitfalls are, and how to avoid failure while squeezing the BEST out of DevOps.

my name is Craig Gardner

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,930
I have listed here two different roles

00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:19,689
that are significant as it applies to to

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,680
this presentation and to this particular

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:24,900
conference

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,960
I am a engineering manager at Sousa and

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,330
in that role I lead a team that produces

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,330
what's known as Susa enterprise storage

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,780
based on SEF the open source project

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,500
called

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,180
SEF and the second role that I have

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,150
listed here is that I am an adjunct

00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,500
instructor of computer science at a

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,989
university nearby where I work and in

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,290
those kinds of experiences my students

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,030
often tell me that it's great to have an

00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,879
instructor at the University who has

00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,250
real life experience in the things that

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,350
are being taught and I value that and I

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,130
think my students value that and when I

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:09,220
am teaching at university I usually have

00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:10,840
40 or 50 students there attending but

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,030
they're there because they have to be

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,250
and you're here today because you at

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:20,950
least are presumed to want to be here to

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:23,200
talk today I picked up this great screen

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,750
shot this what we call that background

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,789
screen back what do you call that

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,799
background yeah it's a background so I

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:30,820
have no idea who's responsible for it I

00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,500
googled it

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,340
at one point looking for something

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
interesting and I thought that's

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,390
beautiful and I need to use that because

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,369
I've got this game of Thrones thing

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,380
going on there's a nice drag and

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:44,140
represented with the suzer logo here and

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,850
I just have a few slides that just for I

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,990
think I'll just read through all of my

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,719
slides and that'll be the most

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,420
interesting way to go through this and

00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,950
yes mark I really don't have 413 slides

00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,280
that's a joke so wanted to make sure

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,280
your

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,080
the subtitle here that I have is is

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,450
having to do with trying to do the right

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:12,420
things and as an analogue to this I come

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,360
to nürnberg with some very comfortable

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,680
frequency I love coming and visiting

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,290
Nurenberg to do working our Sousa

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,030
headquarters is here in nürnberg so I

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,460
have the great privilege and opportunity

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,380
to come and visit here with some

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,740
regularity and when I do I also like to

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,090
explore the city I like to find

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,160
different places that are interesting

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,680
and I like to try to to go different

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,320
routes to the same place from time to

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,690
time and as a case study to apply to

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,730
this as I was getting ready to come here

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,890
on the first day of the openSUSE

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,570
conference I got lost and anulus for the

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,150
most part on purpose right I wanted to

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,870
try and find a different way of getting

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,810
to the place where I was going I knew

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,490
where I was going and I chose to take a

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,570
different route to get there and I ended

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:09,000
up getting lost and I did eventually

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:12,480
arrive at the right place I had all the

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,890
right intentions and all the tools at my

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,680
disposal to do the right thing and I did

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,720
it in the wrong way and of course I did

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,930
eventually get where I need it to go and

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,970
that was a good thing but sometimes we

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,060
make decisions with good intentions and

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,790
knowing where it is that we want to go

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,190
but we make mistakes along the way and

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,080
and a good team and a good organization

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,519
learns from those mistakes and improves

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,420
upon those kinds of things so

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:53,590
my point here is that as I share with

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:56,980
you some of my thoughts both applied and

00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,000
academic about DevOps I hope that you

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,989
will take what I have as as not

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,319
mean-spirited but encouraging and

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:10,720
likewise enlightening so as we talk

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,450
about DevOps here for a moment I ask

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,289
myself what does DevOps have to do with

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:22,060
an open SUSE conference and maybe it

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:24,840
doesn't but I often in my academic and

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,210
professional experiences have

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,620
conversations with a vast amount of

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,280
people that don't understand open source

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,229
yeah you too

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,660
right in the classroom I am often trying

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,320
to teach students about open source

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,350
about open source methods about open

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,840
source values and yet the questions

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,970
persist until they get some more

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,280
practical experience with open source

00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:00,550
their questions are are limited to Oh

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,400
open sources for for example just those

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,789
discrete components of the lamp stack

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,000
right open source is just Linux in a

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:13,210
little Apache and a little database and

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,180
then some kind of application and it

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,400
isn't until they start to see beyond

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,389
those discrete components that there is

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,510
really a broader more valuable purpose

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,940
to open source ideas and open source

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,560
methodologies but the same thing happens

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,900
when I have conversations even with

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,370
those kinds of customers and those kinds

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,970
of organizations that deal with souza

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,360
and Red Hat and other open source

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,360
valuing companies they don't understand

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,599
what open source is intended to provide

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,950
for them so I want to try to apply this

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:56,440
this concept about devops to these

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,810
consistent misunderstandings about what

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,240
open source is intended

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,130
provide as I taught today about DevOps

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,389
we have a few victims or we have a few

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,370
few things that we want to make sure

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,610
that we we identify here and that is

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,389
that the DevOps is just as widely

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:17,750
misunderstood as is the general topic of

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:21,930
open source I even got a recent

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:24,360
notification in my email inbox from some

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,720
group in the LinkedIn community it

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,730
happens to be the DevOps group in the

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,400
LinkedIn community where someone had

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:37,169
posted an article about how to become a

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:40,100
DevOps as if that there's some formula

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:42,479
or some recipe to follow to become a

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,150
DevOps which is was actually you know

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,169
interesting how that was known if I'd

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,600
that you become a DevOps by virtue of

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,580
following this this advice that came in

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,620
this group so there are many

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:01,590
misconceptions about what DevOps

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:06,060
is so I ask you as people consider what

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:11,640
DevOps is is it a magic wand or a silver

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,590
bullet or a golden hammer and as we

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,880
drive down to the purposes of the

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:22,770
evolution of DevOps we want to try to

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:26,039
economize the collaboration of all the

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,910
parts involved in delivering a software

00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,080
solution a textbook would tell us these

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,900
sorts of things

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,030
DevOps is a practice of operations and

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,010
development engineering participating

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,889
together in the entire service lifecycle

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,380
blah blah blah characterized by

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,570
operations staff making use of many of

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,810
the same techniques as developers well

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,830
now that's where I think it becomes a

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:56,700
more interesting discussion the union of

00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:00,120
or at least the combining of the the

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,780
narrowing of the gap between operations

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,520
and development and perhaps if you have

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,760
some experience with DevOps you will

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,610
have seen a graph a Venn diagram similar

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,490
to this this comes directly from

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:18,479
idea as it tries to describe with great

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:21,599
conflict what DevOps really is it's this

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:27,110
union of development and quality

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,849
assurance and operations that is DevOps

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,070
reality tells us some interesting things

00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:35,159
about it as people have put DevOps into

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,469
practice and as people try to squeeze

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,890
the value out of these principles of

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:46,440
DevOps we start to understand that as

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:50,910
much as DevOps has a lot of hype it's

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:54,320
not really anything new it's a process

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:59,430
and though it sounds a little bit

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,980
derogatory it's just another process but

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:06,870
it's and it's built upon a variety of

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,490
very found sorry very sound foundational

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,170
principles that have brought success to

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,709
a variety of different software

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,380
endeavors for many many years what's

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:23,070
important to know is that DevOps as much

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,050
as there is so much hype about it it is

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:28,740
not a silver bullet that solves all

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:32,519
problems but yes

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,970
DevOps surely the principles that are

00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,870
associated with it can work can be made

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:43,610
to be useful in your delivering software

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:46,050
solutions when the conditions are right

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,440
when you've got the right people with

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,720
the right attitude with the right skills

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:54,060
where these people that you have that

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,510
have the right skills are hardworking

00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,600
and are full of integrity and in lots of

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,040
cases a lot of coffee what do I mean

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,589
when I say that DevOps is not

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,440
necessarily new well it's really an

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,740
evolution of a long existing culture of

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,320
trying to provide value through these

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,930
principles known as continuous

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,060
integration and continuous deployment

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,029
you've surely heard those before but

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,860
those are old antiquated terms let's go

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,130
ahead and slap a new title on it called

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,140
DevOps and we'll add

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:29,670
you extra things to it that I'll just

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:36,930
mention to here as continuous foo

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,930
continuous monitoring continuous

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:44,200
updating continuous bug fixing

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,400
continuous testing right all of these

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,590
different continuous things and does

00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,960
that mean that it's bad absolutely not

00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:57,580
it's just that it's now a sexy way of

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,510
trying to put these things together and

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:05,070
a sexy way of getting these people

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:09,610
together to deliver software values

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,760
quickly more agile ly and more

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,670
effectively and it means simply more

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,060
efficient collaboration amongst a

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,560
variety of different entities well what

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,630
kinds of entities are we talking about

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,660
yeah it's different for different

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,090
organizations which is exactly what some

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,190
process that implies agility is supposed

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,840
to be all about right if it's an agile

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,150
process it should be able to be applied

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,040
in a variety of different ways under a

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,340
very a bunch of different circumstances

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,980
and that's good that's a good process a

00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,880
good process that can accommodate some

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,200
variability is a good process and you

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,060
have lots of ways that these sorts of

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,850
things are implemented you have people

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,620
that call it DevOps and IT ops and you

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:58,720
even have the folks like at Google that

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,180
have have called this now web ops yeah

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,920
that's that's good stuff right and if

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,720
Google says it's good and if Google

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,399
gives it a title that it's got to be the

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,279
best thing ever right well

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,709
some of our experts in this world that

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,139
watch how these kinds of processes

00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,269
develop and watch how the people who are

00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:23,569
involved in these processes start to

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:26,240
come together you start to now assemble

00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:30,139
a lot of specialists that know an awful

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,720
lot about an awful lot but it becomes a

00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:35,720
Herculean kind of definition of what a

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,540
web ops engineer is supposed to be able

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,889
to do right that web ops engineer has

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,389
got to be able to know everything about

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,459
networking and has to have some

00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,290
knowledge about routing and has to know

00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,149
about all the different flavors of Linux

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,009
that are in UNIX that are involved and

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,480
knows about caching and knows about this

00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:52,749
and knows about that and has to stop

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,490
speeding trains with his teeth right

00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:58,850
multiple disciplinary experts that in

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,550
reality is kind of a a Montgomery Scott

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,829
saying I gotta make change the laws of

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,600
physics captain right that was terrible

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:09,670
wasn't it that was a really bad Scottish

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,069
accent but you know that this becomes

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,249
either an impossible task in the realms

00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:20,059
of the mythical or as you're trying to

00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:24,050
to get people involved in this process

00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:28,009
who master all of these disciplines you

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,300
burn them out and they die and nobody

00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:37,040
wants that how do we then make value out

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,660
of a process that isn't new that

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,370
continues to allow you to economize the

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,069
collaboration of a variety of people

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,410
with different skills different

00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:50,870
aptitudes different abilities

00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,569
what does DevOps try to control well

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:58,129
typically we talk about historically we

00:13:53,569 --> 00:14:00,379
talked about web type applications but

00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,990
that's not it's not limited to that fact

00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:06,980
I even had this great presentation from

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,749
the app image guy Simon Peter brilliant

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,749
who talked about how DevOps

00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:13,790
is very useful in terms of turning

00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:16,220
around each of the app images when

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,440
there's change it can go through is

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:24,519
DevOps process and validate

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:27,970
and test and deploy these new app images

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,389
on a fairly routine basis a fairly

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:36,759
frequent basis and in a substantially

00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:41,439
automated basis it is intended to

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:45,129
control the agility that's involved in

00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:46,870
all of the performance scaling systems

00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:48,180
up tearing them down when they're not

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,829
needed anymore

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,889
getting the new code out as quickly as

00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:56,800
possible or at least the good code out

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,810
as quickly as possible and not being

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,069
afraid to get code out there quickly

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:05,230
that might have bugs because you know

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,209
you have confidence in your process you

00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,129
have confidence in DevOps so that you

00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:13,000
can turn it around even more quickly if

00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:15,629
you find a problem but sometimes that

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,709
becomes a very difficult race condition

00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:20,589
you don't want to be afraid to make

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,629
mistakes but mistakes look bad

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,579
you hurry to get something out as

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:26,740
quickly as possible you feel that your

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,240
process facilitates that agility you get

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,209
something out that has now a new problem

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,389
and you're it's a very rapid falling

00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:37,089
forward now I'm not trying to paint that

00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:40,870
as a bad thing but it's something that

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:44,259
needs to be controlled and managed the

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:47,680
DevOps processes want to control that

00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:51,370
flow of delivering value to the people

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,230
that are using your software solution

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,220
what does it attend to fix what's broken

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:59,899
that DevOps has to be the sexy thing of

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,149
today that everybody wants to do because

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,240
it fixes all problems like a good golden

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:08,709
hammer well it intends to fix poor

00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,910
communication and particularly that

00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:17,019
challenged communication that happens

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:19,339
between development and deployment and

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,480
for the purposes of what it is that

00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:24,380
we're trying to fix

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,959
we typically lump the efforts of testing

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,079
in with developing but we you know that

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,050
you have to do testing from an ops

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:37,550
perspective as much as you need to do

00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:39,410
testing in the dev functions and it's

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,519
important for us to not lose sight of

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,550
that universality of testing what DevOps

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,560
wants to try to simplify and to enhance

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,130
the collaboration of the testing efforts

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,769
between the dev and the ops so other

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,550
things that DevOps wants to fix it wants

00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:01,660
to fix the inefficiencies of handing the

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:05,380
code over from the one side to the other

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:09,260
it wants to handle the inefficiencies of

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,919
providing a feedback loop both good and

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,240
bad of what's being experienced with the

00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:19,429
software solution it wants to handle the

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,579
conflicts that take place as a result of

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:26,600
the the inherent inefficiencies of that

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:29,540
and it wants to incorporate some sense

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,909
of agility into the operations in the

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,809
same way that developers have attempted

00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:39,670
to incorporate agile processes into

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:44,710
their development practices

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:47,450
it's also a way it is also an important

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:52,240
addressing of inefficiencies that happen

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:56,150
in terms of of customers and trust of

00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:01,190
their being able to say I trust what

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:04,730
this software service is and I can give

00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,830
my trust as a result of the fact that

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,740
there's not this conflict that happens

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,270
between both development and operations

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,280
and there are lots of successful

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,860
companies that do these kinds of things

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:21,080
that use DevOps to their advantage that

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,640
build trust in the teams that are

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,740
producing these kinds of solutions if

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,630
you look at very highly successful

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:31,490
people like eBay they use a very DevOps

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,070
oriented approach to how they release

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:37,370
software you look at Google lots and

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:40,550
lots of DevOps Web ups it's it's they're

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,520
very specialized way of delivering value

00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:47,360
that everybody relies on everybody can

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,610
count on Google is never down Google

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,850
Google always gives you what it is that

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:56,630
you need to have and if eBay was ever

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,980
down how often would people lose

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,380
confidence how often would people start

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,420
spending their money through eBay how

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,320
often would people start selling their

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,730
stuff on eBay so there's some

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,050
effectiveness that comes out of this

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,030
continuous integration and continuous

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,250
deployment and continuous testing if

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:17,660
you've got the right people and you've

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:21,320
got the right culture and if you've got

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:25,070
the right product the real problems that

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,160
we have is not just an academic one it's

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:31,100
that you have the one side that doesn't

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,950
trust the other it's not just the trust

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,440
that exists between a customer and the

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,970
solutions provider it's not just the

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,070
trust that a cut between the customer

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:42,230
and the solution itself the software

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,540
there's the trust that has to take place

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,879
and that is often the problem between

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:50,579
what happens between development

00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:53,009
and deployment of the software solution

00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:56,339
that IT manager that's supposed to

00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:58,979
deploy this software feels like the

00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:01,859
development process is absolute chaos I

00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:04,079
never know what they're going to give me

00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,359
I don't know if they've even tested the

00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,549
stuff that they're handing to me I don't

00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,799
have any trust in what it is that

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,949
they're handing to me on a routine basis

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,139
and not just that I don't have any

00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:18,299
control over it I can whine and complain

00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:20,479
to the dev team all I want they don't

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,699
hear me they don't understand me and

00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:25,289
nothing changes but the same sort of

00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:27,269
thing happens from the dev side they

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,299
look at the operations side of the house

00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:32,039
and they say I just write the code I

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:34,649
have no idea what those operations guys

00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,219
are doing with it I don't even know if

00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:40,049
they're configuring it right that's the

00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:41,999
reality of the kinds of things that are

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,329
going on that DevOps says we gotta fix

00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:48,659
this we've got to bring those two

00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:56,669
together so that we don't have this

00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:57,989
mistrust so DevOps as an ideology does

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,690
these things I'm going to skip over this

00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:02,849
slide let you just ruminate on it

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,519
instead of spending any particular time

00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:07,799
but it allows you to collaborate more

00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:11,879
efficiently and effectively but does

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,639
that really mean that the process of

00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:16,949
DevOps make sure people collaborate

00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:20,759
better make sure people talk together

00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:22,709
better no it doesn't it tries to

00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,109
facilitate it it tries to make things

00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:27,959
easier it tries to reduce the number of

00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:30,449
barriers that exist but at the end of

00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:33,539
the day it's the people that are

00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:35,519
associated with the process that do the

00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,639
collaborating and that do the

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,169
communicating so the process is at least

00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:42,539
trying to get those barriers out of the

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,219
way and is trying to facilitate the

00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,789
means whereby that collaboration take

00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:49,199
place that's a good process okay you

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,329
have the kinds of things that a

00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:54,239
development team does listed here at the

00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:56,669
top you've got the kinds of things that

00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:58,919
the operation team does with here at the

00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,389
bottom and as you start to look at those

00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,290
you start to understand that there are

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:06,810
some inherent

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:09,810
similarities they are really largely the

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,370
same thing and so why is it that we

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,170
can't together get together on these

00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,450
things well that's what DevOps wants to

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,450
do because we're really doing the same

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:23,600
thing why can't we just do the same

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:26,760
thing and as you have the formalized

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,210
definition of what is DevOps in terms of

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,940
its process flow you have these specific

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,550
characteristics that are called out

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:39,450
you're going to code and then build and

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:42,450
then test and then package then release

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,550
and then configure and then monitor it

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,280
and you all want to do this fairly

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:50,340
quickly you want to be able to have a

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,170
quick pace an agile pace you want to be

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,380
able to make changes quickly you need to

00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:58,320
be able to do all of these things that

00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:02,190
matches the speed at which the demands

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,380
for the software change have the speed

00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,290
of your delivery match the speed of the

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,920
requested changes it's not an easy thing

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,620
to do what's an interesting observation

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:18,420
here as you look at this process flow

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:23,010
and as my slide gives away it looks kind

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:26,730
of like a waterfall and indeed although

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:30,090
Khoa DevOps wants very much to say we

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:32,130
hate water believe that's an antiquated

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,900
process we never want to have anything

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,180
to do with waterfall we're going to

00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:40,410
stick it to those old process guys were

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,180
never going waterfall the truth of the

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,890
matter is is that those waterfall --is--

00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,290
principles aren't necessarily a bad

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,520
thing and you want to make sure that

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:52,530
you're doing things in sort of a

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,110
deliberate flowing way that you can

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,240
manage and that you can understand and

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,400
that that you can monitor and that you

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,170
can improve upon and that's what any

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:07,140
good process is about so instead of

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:10,080
DevOps throwing the good of waterfall

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,370
and the good of old well-proven

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,980
processes out it's really just trying to

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:20,650
refine

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:23,880
mine those well intended and time-proven

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,020
processes like a waterfall process and

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,510
just call it something cool that people

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,850
can attach to and call it something

00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,720
that's agile so people can think that

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,490
it's modern and make it as as sexy as

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,799
possible so that people will want to be

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,510
associated with it again I'm not trying

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,130
to say that that means the DevOps is a

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,640
bad thing that it's a charlatan that

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,950
it's a disappointment I'm not saying

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:53,049
that at all let's just recognize what it

00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:57,100
is for what it is so one of the really

00:24:53,049 --> 00:25:00,669
really important details about DevOps is

00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:05,169
this principle of automation now did

00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:08,320
DevOps invent automation absolutely not

00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:11,049
not at all but it makes good use of it

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,540
it incorporates it in part of its values

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,700
and it really is important for us to

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,190
figure out ways to do things in a more

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,100
automated way it makes it easier for us

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,220
to do our work it frees up our time of

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:28,120
the monotonous to do the things that are

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:32,020
more creative and useful and improvement

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,660
oriented now you can't automate

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,809
everything though as much as we have

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:41,559
people that exist that that suggest or

00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:42,669
assert or preach that you know we're

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,690
going to automate everything to the

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,240
point that we don't have jobs anymore

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,549
and we had really interesting talk from

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,380
Mark Seeger just a little while ago or

00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,570
he's talking about how there are some

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,080
problems that are just complex that

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,929
until we figure out how to automate it

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,240
we still have some smart hardworking

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,059
people that have to fix difficult

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,090
problems that have to do some of the

00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:11,919
hard work Automation should be employed

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:15,130
both in dev and in ops and it's reliant

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,510
upon known consistent States and as long

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,900
as they're known and consistent you

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,820
should automate it and that frees up our

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,450
smart hardworking time to anticipate

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,790
those things that are unknown that are

00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,940
unanticipated and work on how to solve

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,190
those so that it's some few

00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:34,430
time we can automate that particular

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,230
aspect in dev we typically talk about

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,520
those things in terms of unit tests a

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,870
variety of different things and in

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,870
configuration management is a

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,060
particularly useful tool for ops what

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,590
can be automated yeah builds can be

00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,970
automated that's probably the easiest

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,440
thing that's the most common thing that

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,230
gets automated but there's lots of

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,360
automation to be used and deployed in

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:57,590
our testing both in dev and in ops and

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,110
automation is particularly useful for

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,610
deployment of software both in your test

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,490
environment and in your production

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,890
environments and of course all of the

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,570
system administration all of the servers

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,300
that are involved virtual and physical

00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:13,940
should all be in some sort of automated

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,040
mechanism control management for this

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,770
particular team and as you do that you

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,360
start to remember that there are

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,730
similarities and what dev does and what

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:27,820
in what Ops do that you can kind of

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:30,650
bring them together to do the same way a

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,660
quick thought from a manager's point of

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,760
views for someone who has managed DevOps

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,920
operations in a variety of different

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:41,030
circumstances what does it take to be a

00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:44,830
successful dev ops organization you got

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:48,080
to have metrics measure everything

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,510
knowledge is power

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,970
make sure that just like I was saying

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:56,600
all throughout this that the purpose of

00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,880
DevOps is to overcome the barriers of

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,010
collaboration and facilitate better

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,020
communication you've got to be able to

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,000
facilitate the dialogue between the

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,830
members of the team the ones that are

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,780
being devs within the team the ones that

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,900
are performing the ops responsibilities

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:14,090
you've got to facilitate that dialogue

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:19,190
make sure that that kind of opportunity

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:22,460
to talk is frequent it doesn't have to

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:25,880
be frequent but that it can be as

00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:30,110
frequent as necessary and that that kind

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,910
of dialogue is not destructive as as a

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,340
manager in a particular team you've got

00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,320
to make sure that your team is

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,810
collaborating constructively and that

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,300
those kinds of communications are well

00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,110
intended certainly misunderstandings

00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,020
take place

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,160
but the better the trust that you have

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,030
amongst the members of this team that

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:55,910
our dev and ops together the better the

00:28:50,030 --> 00:29:05,150
communication will be the activities of

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:08,720
the team should be ordinary too often we

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:13,309
have teams that rely upon the

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,610
spectacular the heroic the staying to

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:21,679
work through all hours of the night they

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:25,820
staying to work on weekends the the the

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,390
kind of heroics that burn people out the

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,880
more ordinary the more routine the more

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:35,179
commonplace the work that's being done

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,669
in a devops ordinary organization the

00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:43,900
more successful that organization will

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:46,970
be at delivering value now there may be

00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,790
heroic periods of time but make sure

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:54,970
that they are infrequent and make sure

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:57,470
that they are short another important

00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,169
managerial aspect to making sure that a

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:03,590
DevOps organization is successful is to

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:06,880
invest in the team invest in the new

00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:11,540
ideas have your team asking themselves

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:15,530
routinely what if what if we did this

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:19,070
different what if we changed this what

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:22,220
have we implemented this ah what if we

00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:25,390
did this instead of that what if

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,220
questions are fabulous in a successful

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,720
DevOps organization and as I have said

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,500
and will continue to say repeatedly

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,360
Trust build an environment of trust so

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,020
we have the devops lifecycle it starts

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,640
with planning

00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,790
you've got to this is a great picture

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,790
the representation in Legos of MC

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:46,490
Escher's the staircase I love it is

00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:49,280
really great and it represents planning

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,500
very well right it's a never ending

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,630
process it's always going on it's a

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,420
möbius of sorts this is something that

00:30:53,630 --> 00:31:00,360
has to have

00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:04,230
the team must make time to plan and

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:08,130
don't leave out the operations part of

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:10,140
this too often the devs get together and

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,030
say oh well we're the first part of the

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,130
process we don't need to involve the

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,570
operations guys we're just going to do

00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,280
our own planning and they'll figure it

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,020
out later on or they'll they'll inherit

00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,260
what it is that we have already planned

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:26,040
bad news make sure that you are planning

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,740
together to be successful in DevOps next

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,810
step execute create channels of

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,100
opportunities to communicate I mentioned

00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:36,300
that a little bit earlier in the manager

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:37,170
special embrace risk let people take

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,080
risks

00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,910
don't encourage recklessness but bring

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,860
in new innovations and new ideas that

00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,350
might not be incorporated that might not

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,360
be espouse that might not actually be be

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:52,800
brought into what's being developed or

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:57,120
the process but allow innovation to take

00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:00,680
place and reward measurable improvements

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,780
say you've got a new bit of automation

00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,520
recognize that inspire people through

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,980
recognizing what it is that they're

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,520
accomplishing while they're executing

00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:14,760
this complex process the next step in

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,620
the flow of the DevOps process is post

00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,280
Rolodex one I want to highlight is post

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:24,000
release make sure as you're having your

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,000
DevOps team being successful that you

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,280
make time for a retrospective that's

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,020
really important to reflect back upon

00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,750
what it is that you've done and how you

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,210
got to where you are today and don't

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,800
stop with all of your automation at the

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,020
end of the release make sure that you

00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,030
are automating stuff that happens post

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,560
release and the last thing I wanted to

00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:47,430
point out here is this concept of

00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,290
breathing Lao allow the team to breathe

00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,150
and I'm going to poke fun it's scrum at

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,160
the moment this is my personal opinion

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,080
and you will disagree but as far as

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,780
scrum is concerned in this concept of

00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:02,100
sprints this is exhausting

00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:05,550
you're constantly sprinting I don't like

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,190
that your experience may be different

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:12,000
but as I try to encourage

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:13,529
festival delivery of software solutions

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,590
with DevOps

00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:20,490
yes you want to be agile yes you want to

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:23,370
be adapting yes you want to be fast yes

00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,470
you want to get those those new fixes

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:29,850
and that new functionality out to your

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:31,559
your users efficiently and fast but

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:35,460
you've got to be able to have some time

00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,179
to step back and reflect and see the

00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,629
forest for the trees the next I'll point

00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:45,450
out here is don't lose sight of these

00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:48,919
the item in the flow of the process of

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:52,470
DevOps of maintaining and I add to that

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,940
sustaining be prepared as part of your

00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,309
planning and as part of your whole

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,080
process to support and maintain the

00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:01,169
software after it is released and not

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,440
just say oh I've released it it's gone

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:05,549
I've got nothing to do with it anymore

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,440
make sure that you're continuing to

00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:09,629
automate and make sure that you are

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,819
continuing to monitor and measure what's

00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:13,230
going on with your software and the

00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,579
experiences that you're had that your

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,849
customers are having your users are

00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:19,589
using so I mentioned golden hammers and

00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:21,720
silver bullets I also mentioned Game of

00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,669
Thrones earlier and I'm I'm really not a

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,349
big game of Thrones guy but I know a

00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:27,869
little bit about it I just want to make

00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:30,300
sure that you realize that that when you

00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:33,389
talk about a DevOps process sometimes we

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,060
have I shared the the the silly

00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,980
representation of some no hippies and

00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,510
stick it to the man we ain't process

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,030
we're gonna go DevOps we're gonna be

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,879
agile man right I know that's that's

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:48,389
kind of a bad silly representation that

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,879
makes makes fun of various aspects of it

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:54,210
but it's important to to recognize that

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:58,349
even though DevOps is intended to to

00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:03,660
improve upon various ancient practices

00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:05,010
it's still a process and as such there

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,319
are things that you need to do in that

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,829
process there are things that are

00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:14,160
important to accomplish in steps and

00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:17,700
with some some clarity and with some

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,260
formality and it may not be so rigid and

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,609
formal as some of the other processes

00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,880
that you've you've been associated with

00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:27,940
but it's still a process and it's not a

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,690
golden hammer and it's not a silver

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,890
bullet

00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:35,589
it requires smart caring hard-working

00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:38,410
people and it requires management it

00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:40,089
can't just happen organically it has to

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:45,430
have some kind of guidance and

00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:46,239
management and rules and process so the

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,920
game of Thrones

00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,920
representation and I'll quickly segue

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,710
then to my Oedipus example instead of

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,329
Game of Thrones but you've it's one of

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,739
the most popular shows in television

00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:58,630
land people don't even necessarily watch

00:35:56,739 --> 00:36:01,660
it on TV right everybody watches Game of

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,849
Thrones on their their devices after

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,579
each episode with Netflix right what in

00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:07,749
Europe is there a Netflix equivalent or

00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:10,299
is it Netflix you just have to be in a

00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,710
specific region I have no idea yeah so

00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:13,869
everybody watches Game of Thrones on

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,210
Netflix thanks very much so there's

00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,430
Peter Dinklage right sometimes people

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,130
say I look like him I'm short and fat

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,170
and I had a beard last time I gave this

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,700
presentation so yeah I really don't look

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,519
like I'm doing okay well and and you

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,779
have some of the popular characters some

00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,509
of the more interesting characters and

00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:33,279
then you have Jamie Lannister and you

00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:35,920
have Jon Snow and you have Daenerys

00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:41,079
right you've got these guys that are

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,819
famous for killing people right Jon Snow

00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,430
at least this was at the end of season 5

00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:49,359
you had five kills for Jaime you have

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:54,640
four kills for Jon Snow and five kills

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:57,599
for Daenerys so G g RR Martin makes

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,079
these characters out to be heroes

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:05,999
desirable people appealing in a lot of

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:11,710
different ways smart organized

00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:16,940
deliberate capable powerful but what I

00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:19,069
don't like about the V the

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,980
in which these powerful people are

00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:25,130
represented is that they obtain power

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:29,300
and manifest their power by killing

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:32,210
people and and that doesn't work for me

00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,599
I don't think that people that kill

00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:39,140
other people are heroes right and and

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,530
I'm not trying to my point is not really

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:45,140
to assassinate the character of of the

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,880
series and of the particular author but

00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,730
it's just an interesting thought to me

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,530
as I consider what it is that he is

00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:55,280
trying to represent through this series

00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:58,099
as very popular series about how to be

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,089
successful and then that led me to think

00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:01,550
about something out a little more

00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:04,180
familiar with and that's the play by

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:07,339
Sophocles Greek playwright of Oedipus

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,480
great Greek tragedy where you know

00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:13,130
Oedipus ends up killing his father and

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,829
in the end you know a lot of bad things

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:18,740
happen by the time this Greek tragedy is

00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:22,099
finished and it's the point I'm trying

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,920
to make here without making you read

00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:30,020
Oedipus and not trying to make you

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:32,540
become a expert in Greek tragedy but the

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:38,650
takeaway here from this Greek tragedy is

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:42,470
Oedipus owes everything to his

00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:47,300
progenitors to his parents to his father

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:50,990
and he only realizes how much he owes to

00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,270
his dad after he's already killed his

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,000
dad and Celeste of them dear dad I'm

00:38:53,270 --> 00:39:00,490
really really really really really sorry

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,800
love Oedipus right before we try to

00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:09,349
assassinate and kill and exert our

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:14,119
powerful DevOps by killing our parent

00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:16,910
the waterfall start to value what it is

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,250
that we're building upon and what it is

00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,589
from waterfall that really was powerful

00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,390
and really is meaningful in terms of

00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:26,869
what it is that we want to accomplish in

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:28,520
an open-source environment in an

00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:29,660
environment that's growing in an

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,500
environment that's trying to provide

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,850
greater

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:39,980
greater and greater value to users in an

00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:42,650
open way in a way that changes the way

00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:46,460
people think in a way that changes the

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:50,570
way people see the world around in a way

00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,630
that creates new thought and inspires

00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:57,800
action and of course we could sit back

00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:01,460
and say well it's only software but the

00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,810
ideas and values that are summed up in

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:09,290
open source changes the world

00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:12,140
and improving upon that and spreading

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,590
that message becomes a very valuable

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:19,040
thing and it becomes a very desirable

00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:23,500
thing the hallmarks of success in a

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:27,530
successful open source project in a

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:30,950
successful process in a successful

00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:33,680
delivery of a solution that changes the

00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,480
way people do things that improves the

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,600
value of what it is that we do on a day

00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:44,420
to day basis that lifts and edifies and

00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:46,040
makes the world a better place has a few

00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,380
of these interesting hallmarks for

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,560
success that are similar between both

00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:53,300
the dev and the ops use configuration

00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,860
management we know that very well from a

00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,020
deaf perspective in terms of using

00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:00,350
things like a get and how grateful we

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:03,290
are forget once we get past of how weird

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:06,110
it is and then all of the operations

00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,020
that take place with configuration

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,910
management that's salt or ansible or any

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,520
of a dozen different other solutions

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:17,330
these are the same thing that we can

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,490
utilize together better in both the day

00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,850
of responsibilities and the operations

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,560
responsibilities we have to test we need

00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,600
to be better about automating those

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,280
tests and we need to do it in much the

00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,750
same way between development and

00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,290
operations if we're going to be a

00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:36,530
successful DevOps approach to delivering

00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,540
software solutions and make sure that

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,790
you're doing it together that you're not

00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,010
just saying oh I'm the developer so I am

00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,300
going to write unit tests and you should

00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,370
have nothing to do with it UQ

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,990
a-and op silly people I don't have any

00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:53,210
reason for you to look at my unit tests

00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:55,010
don't do that share and collaborate what

00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,900
it is that you're trying to test and how

00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,970
it is that you're testing and you'll be

00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:03,920
more successful more automation

00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:06,890
continuous deployment these are all good

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,840
hallmarks of a successful DevOps

00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:13,810
organization I'm going to share just two

00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:16,910
examples with you from Sousa okay I have

00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:20,060
a good relationship with my friends in

00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:23,450
the SCC the Susa customer center who

00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:27,170
successfully use DevOps and deliver a

00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:31,640
valuable product a valuable solution

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:35,870
that customers and users appreciate in

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,930
the customer center team they made a

00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:43,820
team decision this wasn't thrust upon

00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:47,360
them by some evil overlord or poorly

00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:49,810
intended manager the team got together

00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:53,090
and said if we're going to be successful

00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:56,750
we need to be closer together in both

00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:59,150
the dev and the ops and we're going to

00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,880
use a DevOps approach to do that to

00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,440
overcome those barriers of collaboration

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,990
and to improve the kinds of

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,080
communication that we have so they chose

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:13,790
to use scrum and the DevOps approach

00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:19,780
they decided to minimize the specific

00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:24,830
roles of Joe you're a developer and an

00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:27,200
you're an operator it was Joe and Ann

00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:29,630
we're doing DevOps together we're going

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,970
to have development responsibilities and

00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:35,540
operations responsibilities with no

00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:37,400
division between the roles now you might

00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,470
not choose to do that in your DevOps

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,170
implementation but that's the decision

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:45,620
that the SCC team made and it has

00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,630
contributed to their success and one of

00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,180
the nice things about SDC is that it was

00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:54,490
basically a new project with new team

00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:57,430
members it's perhaps harder to organize

00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:00,579
a DevOps

00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:03,640
process if you have a pre-existing bit

00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:05,890
of software with pre-existing teams that

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,380
are already divided between development

00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,520
and operations that's a little harder to

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,750
just say okay we're going to stop doing

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,460
what we've been doing for ten years

00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:15,579
we're going to change it all up it's

00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,619
possible but it's harder in their case

00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,960
it was easy to make this decision as a

00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:21,369
team because they said we're new we're

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,500
not tied to anything old

00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:26,319
we can make these kinds of decisions and

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,430
we bring everybody together they in this

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,720
se team SCC team have fearless

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,390
development they're not afraid to make

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,670
mistakes they're not punished for making

00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:38,680
mistakes they certainly acknowledge when

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,380
they make mistakes but they try very

00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,240
hard to say okay we messed up that was a

00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,800
good try we tried to be innovated it

00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:49,930
fell short we're going to put that aside

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:52,390
and move on and they have as many as 40

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:55,839
developments throughout the day they're

00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,210
rapidly creating new software on a daily

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,220
- hourly - minute ly basis and they're

00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,680
not afraid to throw it out there they're

00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,119
not afraid to deploy I think I said

00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,530
developments I meant deployments you

00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,660
knew what I said what might I meant when

00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:12,430
I said it right they have 40 deployments

00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:14,260
in a day they can push it out and have

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,230
no fear that something's going to be

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,089
broken something might be broken but

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,890
they don't fear the fact that something

00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:22,809
might be wrong because they know that on

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,640
that 39th time that they deployed

00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,319
something and something was wrong they

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,109
can in a matter of minutes turn around

00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,920
and deploy the 40th time and get it

00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:36,040
fixed and move on move beyond the

00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,750
mistakes okay and they're confident in

00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,030
their ability to be agile

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,849
lastly they are automating everything

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:44,500
now do they automate everything no and

00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:46,390
they're always trying to improve the

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,490
number of automations and - and to

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,010
improve the number of automations but

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,900
it's it's it's a something that they

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,150
value and they're constantly automating

00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,670
as much as they can a second example is

00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,890
the open build service and that's a

00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,410
great example here where this team uses

00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,299
a scrum approach they involve agile

00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,369
development and in a similar way the

00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:07,960
people that are the operators that are

00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:10,359
in operations are the same people that

00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,010
are the developers anybody can push a

00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:14,040
deploy

00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,530
at any time with appropriate

00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:22,350
collaboration and approvals but those

00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:26,310
kinds of of agile details within

00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:28,530
operations match what's going on in the

00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:31,260
development aspects of the software and

00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,450
that the team does it together with very

00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,820
little delineation between your

00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:41,520
developer and your an operator and it's

00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:46,020
not necessarily with the same rapid

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,810
deployment that the SCC team uses as I

00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,750
indicated in the previous slide their

00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:55,109
deployment is a little more deliberate

00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:59,700
but they still can deploy as quickly as

00:46:55,109 --> 00:47:03,810
they want to as quickly as it makes

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:07,109
sense they do extensive stress testing

00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:10,490
before any deployment and then again

00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:14,190
lots and lots and lots and lots of

00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:17,460
automation moreover they have a fairly

00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:20,790
comprehensive way of rolling back so

00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,609
here as I wrap things up this is my take

00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:27,540
away for this openSUSE conference what's

00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:29,550
my point I don't know I don't what what

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,740
did you take away from this is entirely

00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:33,510
up to you you get to choose if there is

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,670
any value to this but this is what I had

00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:38,550
hoped to communicate to you as I talk

00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:41,820
about the good and the bad of DevOps

00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:44,460
right DevOps is surely just like any

00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,410
other process it's not a golden hammer

00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,869
it doesn't solve all your problems you

00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,580
can't just go in and say oh we've had

00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,260
all these other things go wrong with our

00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,700
delivering this software solution so

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,980
we're just going to use DevOps because

00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,980
it'll fix everything it won't

00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:05,690
but it can help you to be more

00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:10,310
successful if I'll get to that in the

00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:12,650
next point make sure that as you're

00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:15,920
thinking about the value of DevOps or

00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:20,180
the value of any process that you're

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:27,740
thinking about your people and how your

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:29,990
people work it's easy to say I've got a

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,170
team of 10 people and there are smart

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:35,060
developers and smart operators I can

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:35,600
just throw DevOps at them and that's not

00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,580
true

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,840
it doesn't mean that you can have a

00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:46,820
screw and use a hammer to drive the

00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:50,390
screw if you've got a nail it's darn

00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:54,980
near impossible to drive a nail with a

00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:57,080
screw driver make sure that you pick the

00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:02,710
kinds of processes and the kinds of

00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:04,880
details that match how your people work

00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:08,210
now that doesn't mean that people can't

00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,670
change surely you can change surely you

00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:13,340
can encourage your team members to

00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,570
change and adopt and learn and grow I

00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,700
mean that's what we're here for right

00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,770
that's the whole reason that we're on

00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,290
this planet is to learn and to grow and

00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:22,970
become better your people can do the

00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:26,420
same thing they can learn new processes

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:28,609
they can learn new tools but don't force

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:32,630
a process down you're down the throat of

00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:34,820
this team of people just because you

00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:38,600
read that DevOps is the best thing and

00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:43,070
and you believe the hype the last point

00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:45,140
is most reliable results forget about

00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,900
what the process is whether it's DevOps

00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:50,590
or anything else the most reliable

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:54,980
results that you will get will come via

00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:58,220
hard-working people smart dedicated

00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,550
people within high integrity and the

00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:04,580
amount of trust and integrity that all

00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:06,010
of these different players have with

00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,780
each other

00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:12,280
and the quality of the communication

00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:16,440
that they have so with that I think that

00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:20,370
open source and openSUSE and Linux

00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:26,260
espouse these kinds of ideals and that

00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:31,510
DevOps is a tool that can can help make

00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:36,030
the software solutions better but only

00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:39,040
because of the quality of you people and

00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:40,480
the amount of time and care that you put

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,400
into what it is this is developed

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,510
whether it's software or anything else

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,980
ask your questions anyone have any

00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:55,120
questions you're all tired is yours

00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:59,110
worn out you just want to get on where's

00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,790
the beer I just wanted to say that I

00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,940
think you said one really important

00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,200
thing which is breathe and I feel like

00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,360
that's one of the things that everyone

00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,430
misses from I'm talking about DevOps and

00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,840
so it's kind of a panic all the time

00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,070
it's like we have to do so many things

00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,190
we have to go faster and faster and

00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:17,220
faster and my background is in games

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,320
development before I start on Susan and

00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,540
the the only thing the matter is there

00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,580
is performance and the way you get

00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:26,170
performance is to slow down and look at

00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,700
what you're doing and identify things

00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,340
that you're doing that you shouldn't be

00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:34,390
doing and stop doing those things so

00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,790
measure and optimize and that's really

00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:38,430
the process should be doing so when I

00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:40,930
see people talking about for example

00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:42,400
automation and just talking about

00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,620
automating we just like we have to

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,570
automate all the things all the time you

00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:47,920
saw tomato the problem is you're going

00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,060
to end up automating a lot of things

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,980
that you shouldn't even be doing in the

00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,320
first place so I feel like that's one

00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,400
aspect of the discussion that no one

00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,930
really talks about when talking about

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,000
DevOps and these kind of things oh yeah

00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:00,850
that's an excellent comment thank you

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,220
very much for that supporting comment

00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:05,110
