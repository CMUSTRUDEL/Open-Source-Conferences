"Here is my source code, run it in the cloud for me, I don't care how", this is the mantra of the Cloud Foundry community, the leading open source Platform as a Service project. SUSE is part of the Cloud Foundry community and works upstream and downstream. We have Cloud Foundry running on openSUSE. This presentation will show what this is all about and where we are.
