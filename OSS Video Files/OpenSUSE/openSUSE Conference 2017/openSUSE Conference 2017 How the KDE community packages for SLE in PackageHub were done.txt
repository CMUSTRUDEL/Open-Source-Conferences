Submitting more than 400 new packages to Backports

This talk will explain how the KDE packages were prepared and submitted to Package Hub so SLE users could enjoy them. Missing dependencies, rpmlint complaining about valid packages, not fully available dependencies, missing branding packages... It wasn't an easy path to travel but it was worth it. This talk will explain the problems found and how they were solved with the hope to make it easier for others to submit their packages to Package Hub.
