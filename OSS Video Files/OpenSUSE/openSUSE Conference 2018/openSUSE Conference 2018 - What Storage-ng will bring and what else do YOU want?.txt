Help us to shape the future of YaST

As many openSUSE users may know, two of the most important YaST components, libstorage and yast2-storage, were recently rewritten from scratch in order to ease the maintenance and to be prepared for whatever the future brings. Now we have a solid base to adapt the current behavior without compromising the existing supported scenarios and to implement new and shiny features.

During this presentation we will explain the present and the plans for the supported installation scenarios, for the partitioning proposal (a.k.a. Guided Setup) and for our beloved Partitioner. We need help from the openSUSE community to review and refine those plans and to bring new ideas to the table. Bring your storage wish list!

it's 12 if two sharps oh and first of

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,259
all I want to thank the people taking

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,750
care of the video and the audio and all

00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:21,240
that not only because they are doing an

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,100
awesome work but also because I always

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,130
wanted to use one of these on a stage

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,810
that's so it's feel like a puppy star

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:33,030
now so it's thanks for that so my name

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,299
is anchor I work at the just thing at

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,159
Sousa and that guy over there is he one

00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,100
who also worked as they just aim at

00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,269
Sousa and the ideas that we will have

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,409
now two sessions in a row about

00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:49,650
something that we usually call a

00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:53,159
straight and D or just start and E which

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,030
is basically a full rewrite of an

00:00:53,159 --> 00:01:00,989
important part of just that take care of

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:05,250
storing technologies and so on so this

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,860
first session will be about presenting

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,650
while we are talking about and actually

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,190
all those is scheduled for 45 minutes I

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,190
hope I will not be speaking for so long

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,940
so the idea is that at the end we will

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:24,330
have 10 minutes or even more to turn

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,210
this into a kind of a round table or a

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,160
slope table in this case to discuss

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,590
about since we want for the future and

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,060
then after the break we have a one

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,580
presentation which will be more

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,220
technical were focused on a particular

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,310
part of history D&D and explaining the

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,480
algorithm how it works so you can

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,080
understand better what is happening so

00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,600
back to my session first I will try to

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,150
to explain exactly what what the scope

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,700
so what are we talking about when we

00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,810
talk when we speak about just a storage

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,840
or just a story in this case and I will

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,210
briefly mention the reasons why we did

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,009
it but I willing like to focus too much

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,379
on that because what is really important

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,080
is what we did so far what you already

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,300
have in your lip 15 system or in your

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,240
open source a tumbleweed already since

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,460
January

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,310
that's when the the dating which we

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,200
introduced it did in tumbleweed and

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,900
especially I want to explain what are

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,330
our plans for the future and listen what

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,340
are your plans for the future so now

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,450
that we have written it furnace crud and

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,150
so on I want to hear from the audience

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:42,570
what will be cool to see in the future

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,570
now that we can do mostly everything so

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,090
about the technologies that we are

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,750
talking when we talk about the studying

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:57,820
is basically the layer of dust that

00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:01,240
deals with discs in a very very wide

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,450
meaning of it so file system mountain

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,390
file system format in file system or

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,240
swap and of course partitioning a disk

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,730
knowing which is basis use or not and

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,570
when I again when I say a disk I mean

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,360
regular this rotation rotational and

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,240
solid-state fancy technology some

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,930
mainframes like dusts these that are

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:30,040
connected through a network logical

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:32,110
volumes Linux so lbm writes both

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,810
software and hardware so you name it all

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,690
everything that allows you to have some

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,870
information and read it so configuring

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,800
all that is can be done by asanas the

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:47,230
part that we have rewritten from scratch

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,380
so apart from bring the layer that

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,630
allows other other parts of of just to

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,970
access to to all those devices and to

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,990
ask that information to configure all

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,000
those devices yes just storage also have

00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,580
other parts that are more visible to the

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,060
user that will be especially the expert

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,770
partitioner that we sometimes is very

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,890
useful during installation for more

00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,450
advanced s setups and also in in in your

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,540
system when you know you want to

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,090
recreate partitions or whatever also the

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,990
partition proposal that is that first

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,870
screen that see what you have under this

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,690
during installation makes a proposal

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,700
like okay to install openSUSE on this

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,310
disk I would

00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,710
this will create this partition with

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,020
that size that's exactly the part that

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,290
the one is going to go deeper in the in

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,480
the next session and also something that

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,210
is new in the store attendee in this new

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,270
version we have written is that all the

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:52,110
calculations done by auto just to create

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,230
also partitions logical volumes and all

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,590
that in a disk are now done directly by

00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,170
storage and ye so it's not the auto just

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,720
business anymore it delegates to do this

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:08,460
new piece of software so we have similar

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,580
ways of doing everything so now about

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,740
the reasons as I said I willing as I

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,070
will I would like to spend too much time

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,990
on it but basically the problem is that

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,140
the world has changed and the old code

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,130
was not ready for it so the word has

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,740
changed him several ways especially the

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,410
use case of openSUSE is not anymore a

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,840
desktop and also partially server

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,570
distribution in which you have root

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,760
partition a home partitions and swap and

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:45,870
thus it we have well a lot of other use

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,540
cases we have cubic we have also since

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,620
we serve liquor with the code with Lee

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,540
we have products for deploying SAP etc

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,060
we have these transactional updates

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,000
which is a cool feature that will be

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,070
actually a belief in succession but it

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,910
collides with even one so you will miss

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,370
it but anyway it's a new configure to to

00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,180
update the system and needs a particular

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,960
set up on the disk and it was very hard

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,840
to hammer all those things in in the in

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,640
the old code especially because the old

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:28,140
code was not that August so it was hard

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,540
to maintain it it was this kind of

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,150
application that that something and any

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,280
single breaks so the new one is we have

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,310
invested a lot of time writing it and

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,190
doing it with the right funding so every

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,129
in obvious steps we have automated tests

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,860
we have

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,719
and we have miss yours about the code

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,239
quality to make sure that we are not

00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:54,729
taking shortcuts and the quality's also

00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:57,939
it's always at the right level so okay

00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,739
what have we done so far that is what do

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,860
you already have in your system if you

00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:05,709
have just storage in D so first of all

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,739
the installation guided setup that is a

00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:11,830
set when you is one of the first steps

00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:14,830
on installation your interview I saw

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,709
your DVD whatever they accept the

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,979
license and then you have to select the

00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:23,559
role if you want it to be a kiddie you

00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:27,669
know more server with stands XML updates

00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:29,800
or whatever and certainly after that you

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,499
will just clean that already offers you

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,079
a possibility on how to start up and so

00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,939
set your machine for example is the the

00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,819
one you can see on the right that says

00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:43,179
okay this is the initial layout that I

00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:45,789
proposed with the default settings and I

00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:49,449
would resize the windows partition and

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:50,860
then by seventy weeks for example and

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,319
then I will create these three four

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,329
partitions and if you are not fully

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,990
happy with it there's a guided setup

00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,639
button so you can modify tweak a little

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,829
bit like I really don't want to use

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,939
whether FS I prefer to not have a

00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:09,159
separate home whatever and then it makes

00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,199
another proposal visit on those new

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,479
settings that what used to be called

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,610
something like proposed change proposal

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,999
settings now has a more meaningful

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,889
hopefully name and it's not a pop up

00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:24,459
with a dosing of options anymore but

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:27,849
some kind of a wizard but it's basically

00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:30,069
the same idea the same idea but once

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,949
again completely rewritten especially

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:35,969
because now it's fully configurable by

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:40,630
the release manners or by anyone

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:43,779
defining a role or by anyone creating an

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,190
OpenSocial derivative distribution so

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:49,430
for every wrong the

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:53,720
that maybe redefine it which partitions

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:56,510
you will be suggested to create which

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,670
order sizes which is considered to be

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,250
the good size the minimum is the maximum

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,110
and everything else and not only that

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,110
but also you will click on the guided

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,600
setup button so you go step by step and

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,560
you get several questions to fine tune

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,360
that it can also be configured which

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,420
question are you going to see there and

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,040
so for example home is mandatory for a

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,280
given role for whatever reason so they

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,160
you cannot antique home or or swap is

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,710
mandatory or swap is optional and there

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,380
a lot of things that can be tweaked by

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:35,720
anyone creating role or or distribution

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,830
we also took the opportunity to revise

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,900
what are the the partitions that are

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,900
created by this proposal in order to

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,330
make grab they would monitor work I'm

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,770
mentioning that explicitly because it's

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,450
it comes with a change that maybe some

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,240
people will not be used to that in the

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,280
past we used to offer a separate would

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,940
quite often for example if you were

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,560
installing on IBM or encrypted or

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,090
whatever there was always a separate

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,630
good because was considered a good

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:13,240
practice back then is not the case

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:15,860
anymore actually counter yeah it is bad

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,660
if you want to use a synopsis for

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,990
example because if the wood partitions

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,060
is is apart from the system it will not

00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,110
be integrating into a snap shopping and

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,450
so on so now we only proposes a very

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,930
good one is fully needed to wood and

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:36,380
grab shoe is already very smart so it's

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,350
all almost never needed and also another

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,480
change with it is that we proposed GPT

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,320
partition tables by default instead of

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:50,000
the all ms-dos or MBR or how we want to

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,600
call it a system but in general it

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,940
should propose something that is still

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,220
written a wall worked for more

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,660
situations

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,370
and as I said there's another more

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,460
visible part of the obviously story town

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:10,030
yesterday in this case that is there sir

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:13,690
partitioner and in this first version

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:16,210
you will see almost nothing new I would

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,570
like to say that we decided to introduce

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,910
the change little by little so first the

00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,450
proposal and then in the next version

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,040
the partitioner will be revamped but

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,150
reality is that we simply ran out of

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,130
time so there we had many ideas of

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,800
things we wanted to introduce in the

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,020
partitioner but we decided to just

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,640
create a clone of the old one with the

00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,790
same functionality and the same

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,910
interface just to make sure we make it

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:50,020
on time for little fitting and for a

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,290
silly 15 and from now on we plan to add

00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,960
the audio functionalities are only in

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:59,140
some cases there you will miss some

00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,730
small scenes like right-click so you can

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,620
do everything double click and use the

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,240
buttons but right clicking for example

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,620
on a partition to format it is not

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,410
possible you have to use the format

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,040
button that is below on the list no big

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:15,040
deal but and on the other hand since we

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,700
rewrote it from scratch it's now more

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,400
more consistent with the proposal so as

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,470
I said you already selected a role at

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,970
the beginning of distillation that means

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:29,620
the proposal will propose a root

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,870
partition and a harp and this home

00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,480
partition with some settings for how to

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,970
mountain or which sub volumes to create

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,640
for the better assess volume and the

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,950
partitioner all also knows all that so

00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,190
if you create everything from scratch as

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,990
a root partition selecting using only

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,390
the partitioner and so on you will get

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,550
exactly the same list of officer volumes

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,160
that the proposal does you will get

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,430
exactly the same amount options that the

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,470
proposal will do because I have read up

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,240
quite some people was kind of a scared

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,570
of doing since manually and thus for

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,220
petitioner because there was like black

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,710
magic and hidden knowledge in the

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,420
proposal that they will not have so

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,420
that's not the case anymore you

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,880
use the partitioner it's also aware of

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:19,600
all those configuration option that we

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,570
have mention so that's what you already

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,410
have in your systems if you are in

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:30,279
tumbleweed or you are using Li 15 so

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,769
let's see now what do we plan so after

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,079
that you can tell us what do you plan or

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:40,720
what is just coming to your mind as you

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,579
hear me speaking or whatever so since we

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,120
were talking about expertise in ER let's

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:49,720
finish with that something that now all

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,589
the layers allow is to directly use a

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,690
disk and format it because in in the

00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:58,420
current Esther partitioner you want to

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,360
create a file system you've won Sansa to

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,579
be format has a confess X 3 X 4 or

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,850
whatever you first need to create a

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:09,940
partition in the disk and then you can

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,889
you can use it but there's actually no

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,019
reason for such a limitation and now it

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,880
will be very easy to add to the

00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:19,480
petitioner the option to use full disk

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,630
as physical volumes as file system or

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,740
whatever also in the software defined

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,839
rights the MD rights the idea right now

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,480
is that you need to create a right

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,089
device for every file system so you and

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,980
they always mess with from partitions so

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:39,699
you create let's say you have two discs

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,430
and you want to have route I'm home on

00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:49,690
those two DS so you have to create SDA

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:51,279
and SD b SD v 1 and as the v2s de a 2

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,829
and as the V 2

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,350
I hope I didn't say it wrong and then

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:59,769
you create write devices fronting and

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,720
you then you have to form format that

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,529
ready vices but actually you could

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,110
perfectly create a right from the whole

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,690
tube whole disks and then create

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,079
partitions inside the right don't have

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,149
your your your file system so all those

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,819
combinations and every crazy combination

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,430
you can imagine about using for this

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:23,340
partitioning partitioning a right using

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,340
a right a cities now will be

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,820
but of course we didn't want to yes take

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,380
the these sex young put every single

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,080
chain in the right and everything that

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,090
is on the right also in the DS and all

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,430
the option for partitions but then also

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:42,600
in the Indus because that will mean you

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:45,630
will have like 15 buttons for every

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,110
lying on every on every listing so we

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,710
need to rethink about it but it will be

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,810
one of the very first things we will do

00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,790
also we want to turn better Facebook

00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,850
volumes into first-class citizens

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,890
because right now you can define the

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,570
list of civilians but yeah in the

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,020
partitioner they really look like a flat

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:10,200
list of names and so balloons are much

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,339
more than that so we we want to make

00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,580
possible to create the proper hierarchy

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:20,160
to to define the the properties for each

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,190
volume like a special configuration of

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,839
the file system like copying right and

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:29,490
all those scenes are especially useful

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:34,260
for databases make the snapshot team

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,820
more visible and so on so on also we

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,850
know that the some of the warnings that

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,060
right now the partition Ares is is

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,730
providing to the user are hard to

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,060
understand to put it in a nice way

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:52,100
so we also plan to turn in something

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,050
more human readable and last not least

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,770
after you have seen before the idea is

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,250
that right now when you get to that

00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,410
screen you have the guided setup that is

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,420
very much guided for beginners so it

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,939
only works from what you have on the

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,550
disk to what you probably want to have

00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,670
and a seat and for any other situation

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,679
you should go to the expert partitioner

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:22,530
and when you do that you are to a big

00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:24,870
stand on your own so we want to fix that

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:26,280
a little bit so okay you are on your own

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,800
but doesn't mean that you have to do

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,780
every single step by hand for example

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,910
just making a situation in which you

00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,040
want to install you don't have a clue

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,539
what the best setup for for the role you

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,350
select is

00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:43,529
you already know that you want to reduce

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,389
your home so you know that yes there's a

00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,279
partition that's your home reduce my

00:17:45,389 --> 00:17:49,110
home and do whatever else you want with

00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,269
the rest whatever their release manager

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,200
decided that this table set up so then

00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:58,499
you can go to the experts of partitioner

00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,399
just that particular artesian mark ok

00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:05,220
Monty's at home and for now on to do

00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:07,980
your proposal with index for petitioner

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,200
it will redo a whole proposal but still

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,269
reusing your home of course not the late

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,309
in your home and then you are backing

00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:17,159
the sir petitioner everything already

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:21,330
set up I'm from there you just fine-tune

00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:24,990
or imagine you prefer to select yourself

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,610
what do you want to delete or resize so

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,039
you do all the previous work that

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,259
destructive part in this partition er

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,940
and then within Dexter partitioner okay

00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:38,450
at the I already make room for you now

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:42,659
make you make openSUSE fit into this and

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:45,149
so you will be using like sub components

00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,730
of the proposal without needing to do

00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:49,470
everything from scratch or another thing

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,019
that is possible to wind up in the

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,110
current extra partitioner and many

00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:58,279
customers of our enterprise division do

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,480
very often it's setting a right system

00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,450
there are options the partitioner you

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,090
can do it easily you only need to click

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:08,549
50 or 60 times and that's it so you

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,080
enter a right you create you decide what

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,179
to Monte you can partition when the

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,009
since isanother this and then you group

00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,110
those two in a right and then you great

00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:18,029
and then you have root and then you

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,110
repeat the signs for home and for any

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,710
other partition you want

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,570
so it's possible but it's kind of a hell

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,730
you only have to look at the open QA

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,369
test when right when they are testing

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,350
right they are like three lines of his

00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:34,049
Prince's going back home for were in the

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,869
petitioner so we also want to have for

00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:41,809
example a dedicated we start within the

00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,809
petitioner to create right right layouts

00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:49,410
and that's about the petitioner that's

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:52,130
out there like the most relevant and

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:55,860
she ideas we have for the practitioner

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,570
and also to give you an example of the

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,340
kind of things that now we can do with

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,520
relatively easy work but also the

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,480
proposal we need to find tanida a lot

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,880
what we have is a dot zero version so

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,490
it's good enough to make mostly

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,130
everything that your proposal did but

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:20,070
now we have to turn it into a smarter

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:24,420
sync for that we really really need

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:26,880
feedback because in in playing scenarios

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,740
like there is a Windows partition what

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,620
there is an empty disk or there is an

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,200
previous event Suzanne just delayed what

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,390
unit and install that kind of works but

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,220
we need to make a smarter decision some

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,050
more complicated scenarios and for that

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,020
we really need to hear from you what is

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:46,530
working what is not or what would you do

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,820
and also they all part their proposal

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:53,430
used to try to reuse several stuff like

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,700
for example if you were using an LVN

00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:01,410
setup and it found a previous volume

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:04,890
group it right to reuse it which I never

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:07,170
fully understood but we kept some of

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:11,160
that behavior but I would really like to

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:14,340
know about what are the use cases for

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,760
reusing something in the in maybe if we

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,920
implement the wizards on that petitioner

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,750
producing a stuff become less important

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,540
so we don't need a guided setup to take

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:28,020
any decision in that regard and we can

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:31,980
make it a little bit more destructive we

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,100
really need to test inspect and adapt so

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:38,160
we need to hear friend you and also

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:42,660
something we want to change some more in

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,090
a more visible way again is the

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:47,310
possibility to to have hyperlinks in the

00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,850
description like once again I will go

00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:53,970
back when you are hearing that list of

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:57,870
actions like I cannot have a create

00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,900
partition with 20 gigabytes for root

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,430
with butterface so for example you can

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,920
click on the battery phase

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,720
and then you can select another file

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,430
system type there and they will

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,990
recalculate everything without needing

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,260
to go through the whole guided setup you

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,610
only want to disable root or hum or swap

00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,490
or whatever and you don't want to go

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,590
through the forest steps it will not

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,880
kill you clicking next four times

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,420
whether it will be like more

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:29,670
straightforward to just disable that

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:32,490
that particular partition um that's what

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,800
we had already planned at we plan and

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,250
many of the things we wanted to do for a

00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,160
leaf 15 but we ran out of time so now we

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:44,340
shall as I said turned this into more

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:47,040
bi-directional sync and and listen to

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,260
your to your feedback to your your ideas

00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,710
since you haven't liked it so far since

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,200
you would see now that we have more

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,780
power to change things and so on

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,780
actually we have already obtained quite

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:05,100
some feedback through Mozilla through

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,350
the mailing list or just in our blog

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,190
post in case you don't know they just

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:13,470
think writes a blog post in every two

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,510
three weeks explaining what we are

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,810
working on we have what we have already

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,760
merged in to tamper with and so on and

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:23,430
people sometimes comment there so for

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,680
example we know that some people in some

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,840
situations will liked any proposal to be

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,260
less aggressive with windows although

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,940
it's actually not in my opinion not

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,150
aggressive at all but if you already

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,660
have a window that is not that big like

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,550
only seventy weeks which sounds a lot to

00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:44,190
me without having a snaps or some nasty

00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,350
letter but whatever so and they want to

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:51,890
somehow in some situations tell the

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:54,960
proposal please don't be so so hungry or

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,510
people that in general are like like how

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,600
the proposal works but they don't fully

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,690
agree with the values that were

00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,090
pre-selected for for for example if you

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,640
have route with the snapshots 40

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:11,370
gigabytes doesn't sound so not for me so

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,280
please allow me to reduce the proposal

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:15,910
but telling it exactly the opposite

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,830
never see the

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,490
which that is being more hungry in this

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,590
case I love since like that like people

00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,750
that believe that if there are big

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:29,170
partitions there should be deleted in

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:32,590
the last ones because big partitions

00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,750
usually mean data partitions something

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,700
we haven't sort of already we solve big

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,350
partition model space for us yes the let

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,620
that one so we don't have to delete any

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,690
other one and we can fit being less just

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,640
the less destructive with the other so

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,020
we only have to delete one but then

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,940
users complaining yeah but you deleted

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,130
the world they're worse one because the

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,970
bigger is usually the most valuable so

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:56,500
oh no it doesn't have to be like

00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,720
feedback about the proposition or or

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,750
since like that but also yes EDS yes

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,030
maybe something I have always wished

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,670
that in the experts in here I would have

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:10,720
a button for world domination whatever

00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:13,030
so now it's time to to put that in

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,420
common and of course if nothing comes to

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:20,770
your mind like right now the Justin is

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:23,350
also easy to to reach we have the just

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:26,170
devil openSUSE Ark mainly least we as

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:30,160
the name suggests usually use it for

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:32,320
their own discussions but you you as a

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,020
user can just go there and ask anything

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,790
because most of the developers will be

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:42,760
there and will listen to your to your

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:46,570
requests also an IRC will have an just

00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,600
channel on freenode and of course we

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:53,020
have bad sila but please don't use

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,940
bugzilla to Tutera stations about what

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,040
will you look like to see so please

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,530
discuss in an IRC on the mailing list on

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,330
of course is a feedback about the

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:05,230
proposal that is doing something wrong

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:08,290
the maxi lice is done the right place so

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,900
that's all what I wanted to say that

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,370
gives us quite some time still for

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,850
questions and wishes so now the session

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,850
is yours

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:31,130
[Music]

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,189
[Music]

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:47,640
[Music]

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:50,370
how about snapshot handling will I be

00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,140
able for example to get rid of my old

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,880
snapshots when I do an upgrade actually

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,620
that something that this mod currently

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,820
buys snapper and we have adjusted

00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,010
snapper module that is the module

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,870
usually in which you can just open

00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:10,650
graphically and the lettuce lapses and

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:13,590
so on but having some kind of

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:19,640
integration yet during the installation

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:22,080
process or that great process so enjoy

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,060
yeah because if you are doing an upgrade

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,610
maybe you don't have just a snapper yes

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,430
there and you just want to to do it as

00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:44,670
part of their great process okay that's

00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:47,070
I will make a note for that I would like

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,840
to raise awareness that arm and several

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,820
other companies including some other

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,050
participants are currently working on a

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,630
draft specification called ebbr embedded

00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:01,320
booze boot base requirements and which

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:03,690
were noting some recommendations both

00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,030
towards firmware bootloader developers

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:09,690
as well as to operating system in this

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:12,120
choice on how to deal with booting on

00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,770
certain you know smaller environments

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,710
like raspberry pi and other class of

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:18,900
devices and and that will one of the

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,520
things that i recently became aware of

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,520
that there will be like a certain

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,680
partition types defined that this choice

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,509
should not be touching as well as

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,379
certain

00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:33,129
limits I think it was under discussion

00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:35,869
whether it was like 1 MB or 2 MB that

00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:39,649
the distros should should not be

00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:42,649
touching before that going beyond that a

00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:44,899
question - what's your side

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:48,519
or maybe also to the audience if they

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:51,999
know beyond this detection of Windows

00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:54,499
did I understand correctly that this is

00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:59,869
implemented in your own code and lip

00:28:54,499 --> 00:29:03,549
storage ng and if so how do you think do

00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:07,789
you have any plan to recognize more

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:12,349
partitions that should be kept untouched

00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:14,929
by the openSUSE installation ok so well

00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:18,139
yes we have the liver storage which is

00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:19,879
the low level part that identifies all

00:29:18,139 --> 00:29:23,389
the partitions and which file systems

00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:25,729
are on them and sometimes we even get

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:29,779
curious among them to inspect the real

00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:32,899
content so we just identify that by the

00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:35,029
signature so ok since it's an NFS but

00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:37,879
sometimes we want to really see if it's

00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:40,849
Windows or data whatever so what we have

00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:44,269
then is when we are creating the this

00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:47,509
proposal we actually separated because

00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,639
it was alike like for example all those

00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:52,519
embedded system or arm has different

00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:54,859
requirements so we actually have

00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,329
something that we call we call the boot

00:29:54,859 --> 00:30:00,889
requirement strategies so for we detect

00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,690
for example this look like this

00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:05,869
architecture and whatever so let's use

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,749
this strategy and then we can recognize

00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:10,789
for example partitions that we mark for

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:12,619
is all when we have already done that

00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:15,649
then we decided ok this will be for

00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:17,209
example good Fe and Fe partition we

00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,339
should reduce it and not create an

00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:22,549
alternative efi partition which if

00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:25,639
there's one already or a prep

00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:28,339
partitioning in PPC's is saying example

00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:31,940
that if there is one you should probably

00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:34,399
not delete it but reduce it so all that

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,899
is done on different strategies so for

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,469
example if you identify different

00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:40,010
scenarios like ok I can say now that I

00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:42,290
honor

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,720
verify I know because I check whatever

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,700
value then you use the strategy for that

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,050
and that you specify their what to use

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:56,030
and what to respect what to great use

00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,040
and so on and the idea is that it's on

00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:01,400
often also that's documented from the

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:04,100
source code we use r-spec is a test

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,600
suite for for groovy that allows us to

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:11,480
write a unit test which outputs it's

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,940
like a specification so for example you

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,040
or any other expert can take a look -

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,200
okay this even this situation we do

00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,350
notice on that looks pretty much like

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,080
English so you can say okay I will sign

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:27,080
it looks good to me and that's exactly

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,750
what the source code does so in general

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,410
every expert on every platform can

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:40,820
review the requirements and tell us what

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:44,540
is wrong but that means that all this

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:47,180
code is and those patterns too to match

00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,850
for all specific to openSUSE and there

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:53,030
is currently no sharing of such data

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,890
sources with Fedora Debian or anyone

00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,510
else beyond those that are you know

00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:01,010
choosing to use the open source lab

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:03,530
storage engine library yes well actually

00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,600
there is nothing that is like deathly a

00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:10,010
specific for openSUSE

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,290
in in code but is integrated in just so

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,260
because they live a story to do a

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:18,170
low-level part that handles like

00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,480
identifying and mounting the partitions

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:22,550
and so on that's actually not just

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,630
specific at all could be used by any

00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,670
other project but that logic about in

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,740
which a scenario which partitions are

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,630
relevant is you touch or not are

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,280
actually already in the last part

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,630
they're not in a library part so it's

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,390
reducible to the point that actual

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,400
leaders they're just plain Ruby objects

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,170
and so on and the specification is

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,630
written in a text file because it's a

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:50,790
specification that is yes auto-generated

00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,950
but so far it's not

00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:55,110
that part is already in the last part

00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,480
which means that is probably not much

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,480
reducer only as documentation I guess

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:13,080
[Music]

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:16,260
hey I'm thinking of after for example

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,780
building ISO image by Kb

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:23,160
and so directly installing a selected

00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:25,200
package on system so that new Libya's

00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,530
area storage energy can be integrated

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,470
with that so that smart partitioning

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:33,930
depending on the existing system zone so

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:36,510
others as smart parts are actually not

00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:39,210
in liver storage not in the library but

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,880
already down in the pro-v part I mean in

00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,430
the last part yeah so if the key bit

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,270
configuration or whatever can manage

00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:52,290
that then it's possible to yeah

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:55,320
implement somehow in clear away mmm yes

00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:57,900
I mean as I said most of the parts are

00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,720
are are done for our own purposes and

00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:04,140
also and all these smart things are in

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,750
Ruby so it's maybe not so nice to

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,450
integrate with TV the library part it's

00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,070
Eastern C++ and has binding for Python

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:14,730
that's as far as I know

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:19,080
give it some Python so what all these

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,880
smartness of the proposal we will have

00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:26,640
to sit down and see how we can make it

00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:28,260
reusable forgive you okay thank you but

00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,020
what is important is that we are trying

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,610
to document the knowledge now that's why

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,150
we have have we had to rewrite

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:38,910
everything on to to take a look to many

00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:42,960
scenarios in which their proposal did a

00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:44,520
separate boot but why so now we are

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,500
documenting so as I said the

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,230
documentation is auto-generated from the

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:53,340
code so it says I'm proposing a separate

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:55,230
good because so even as a source of

00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,590
information I believe that what we are

00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,360
doing is highly reusable because she's

00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,170
not

00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:14,900
yes a bunch of code is there is some

00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:17,900
researching and documentation behind so

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:22,160
if that's all I guess we will have a

00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:27,200
break now and at 3:00 you even will be

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,570
send all the work in a very superficial

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,430
way we will not go deep into how

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,560
everything is calculated but will

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:37,420
present exactly this proposal that

00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:42,110
installer will do for for you

00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,110
