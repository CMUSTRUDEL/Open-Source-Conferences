Help us to shape the future of YaST

As many openSUSE users may know, two of the most important YaST components, libstorage and yast2-storage, were recently rewritten from scratch in order to ease the maintenance and to be prepared for whatever the future brings. Now we have a solid base to adapt the current behavior without compromising the existing supported scenarios and to implement new and shiny features.

During this presentation we will explain the present and the plans for the supported installation scenarios, for the partitioning proposal (a.k.a. Guided Setup) and for our beloved Partitioner. We need help from the openSUSE community to review and refine those plans and to bring new ideas to the table. Bring your storage wish list!
