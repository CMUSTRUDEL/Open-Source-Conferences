Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	openSUSE & SUSE exploring the container world

The Kubic Project is an exciting new part of the openSUSE family. This talk will provide a brief introduction of the Project and how it focuses on container technologies such as the Docker & Podman runtimes, Kubernetes, Transactional (Atomic) Operating System updates, and much more.

The session will then go into detail how Kubic provides the base for SUSE's Container as a Service Platform (CaaSP), explaining how Kubic serves a similar role to that product as Tumbleweed does to SUSE Linux Enterprise, and explaining the relationship between CaaSP versions, SLE versions, and Tumbleweed.

Finally, this presentation will be an opportunity for those interested in Kubic to learn ways they can get involved with the project and contribute, regardless if their interest is containers, orchestration, testing, or atomic system updates.
