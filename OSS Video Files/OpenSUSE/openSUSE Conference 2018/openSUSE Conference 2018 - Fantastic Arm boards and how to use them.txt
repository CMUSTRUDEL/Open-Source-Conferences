News on hardware and Spectre

Following up on last year's talk (https://events.opensuse.org/conference/oSC17/program/proposal/1246) I intend to give an update on hardware support in openSUSE and software support for new boards. This will include an update on Meltdown/Spectre mitigations and what users need to take care of.
