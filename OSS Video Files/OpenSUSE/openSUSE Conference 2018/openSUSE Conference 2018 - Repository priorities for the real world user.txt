Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	Use additional repositories with confidence

The topic of additional repositories comes up on a regular basis. The official position is to submit everything to Factory to avoid the issue, but for a large number of reasons this cannot always be the case. As such users living in the real world have to navigate the unsupported landscape. By far the best approach is to use repository priorities available through libzypp, but unfortunately this is not well known.

This quick talk will cover the basic usage of priorities, strategies for real usage, and examples of how effective the workflow can be. Additionally some pitfalls will also be covered.
