Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - Ceph Manager Dashboard
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	How do I manage such a big cluster?

The original Ceph Manager Dashboard that was introduced in Ceph "Luminous" started out as a simple, read-only view into various run-time information and performance data of a Ceph cluster, without authentication or any administrative functionality.

However, as it turns out, there is a growing demand for adding more web-based management capabilities, to make it easier for administrators that prefer a WebUI to manage Ceph over the command line.

After learning about this, we - the openATTIC team - approached upstream and offered our help to implement the missing functionality. Based on our experiences in developing the Ceph support in openATTIC, we think we have a lot to offer in the form of code and experience in creating a Ceph administration and monitoring UI.

We already reached feature parity and replaced the existing dashboard mgr module and we're moving forward. If you want to learn more about it this is the right talk for you.

test test one two one two and now we can

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,370
hear me as well

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,740
but you hurt me without a microphone as

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,800
well so it's just for recording yeah

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,410
it's cool so thank you very much let's

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,859
start for joining attending this

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,260
presentation this time it's kind of and

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,779
follow up what we did before before I

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,939
did a rough explanation what service and

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,740
now the follow-up is how to manage the

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,860
whole stuff I was like to talk about

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,570
this mnsure dashboard same thing as

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,980
before if you're interested in just

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,320
again the QR code you would directly

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,550
redirect it to the link it's hosted on

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,590
get up

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,530
written and reveal because someone asked

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,450
me before it's written in reveal.js

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,950
and it scales down to any device I could

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,800
do a separate presentation afterwards

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,329
about this this is amazing thing so

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,850
let's starts today we would like to talk

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,520
about safe measure dashboard and I say

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:05,220
we I mean my lovely colleague Laura

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,369
Marano and myself I'm I'm Kye and here

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,799
just the content for today

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,430
another quick introduction just let you

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,650
know who we are

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,330
then some kind of history to get a

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,180
better understanding about the

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,680
background where we coming from

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,830
therefore we have to talk about open

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,049
etic and yes it has nothing to do with

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,689
it's not a specific part of a house it's

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,400
different discussion someone in Germany

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,850
tried to find a cool name for storage

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,590
solution it could be complicated so

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,460
seems like German folks are not that

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,400
good in finding English storage solution

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,829
names that's how we ended up with an

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,810
open etic second thing is the dashboard

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:50,159
to be one finally we're switching to -

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:52,950
would be - and if the Wi-Fi will work

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,860
and I hope so we'll have a live demo

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,920
prepared and more people joining welcome

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,950
nice to have you so let's start with a

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,100
quick introduction I think I talked

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,320
about myself already name is clear same

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,560
thing like before you can find me on oft

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,770
see in the separate different channels

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,440
we both are from Fulda or near B folder

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,430
it's in the middle of Asia middle of

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,940
Germany somehow hidden our date of birth

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,620
amazing and once I updated the slide or

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,900
those slides I figured out maybe it's

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,270
not the best idea to write the hours

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,890
down because then I figured out of Manas

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,250
thing I have the feeling I'm getting old

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,340
because the hours are so many already so

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,540
maybe I will change this so this is

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,070
enough from an introduction and

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,870
obviously people are from Suzy quick

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,300
history to get a better understanding

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,300
and for the history as I said I would

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,010
like to start with the automatic cool

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,530
name what is it someone heard it maybe

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:03,240
before open attic was founded in 2011 so

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:06,540
quite some while ago and initially open

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,050
attic looked like that and what was made

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,290
for it was made for managing just the

00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,200
local appliance storage piece of

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,580
hardware to create some LVM shares on

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,170
top share it via NFS I scuzzy sips also

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,390
fiber channel I was proud of that one

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,980
fiber channel was possible and you could

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,530
create snapshots and all those things

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,870
but just on one on a single instance

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,760
later on we poured in you were able to

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,340
add another storage and we supported dr

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,030
VD as well you could create tirupati

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,750
shares within the UI that's how the

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,930
whole thing started so I would say a

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:52,070
single unified web bi solution to

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,070
storage to manage just one piece

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,930
afterwards

00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,490
roughly two and a half three years later

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,580
2014 we added the initial self support

00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,980
because we figured out sort of like self

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,930
is a cool project maybe we should also

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,570
do something in the UI as we have it

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,490
already and the first thing we've added

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,650
wealth that what is that that's the

00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,239
visualization of the crush map and if

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,130
you've attended my talk beforehand you

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,410
know what the crush map is the topology

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,110
of the cluster and it can pull it that's

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,860
cool and we thought it was cool and it's

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,310
still in the current

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,270
and a stream version of automatic but we

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,310
modified just one thing and the initial

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,310
version as was this was possible to edit

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,349
this crush tree and to add new rules to

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,259
the crush map and it could also trek and

00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,449
drop every entry into industry and then

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,550
it could just click on apply and that's

00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,050
it no further notification nothing just

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,919
we saw this that's cool to modify the

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:58,060
crush map but we figured out that people

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,650
customers whoever will use it and they

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,069
will change something click on apply and

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,719
then they're kinda screwed and then they

00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,639
call you why the hell is my cluster

00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:08,469
stuck and I can't use it anymore and

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,409
it's busy almost 100%

00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:13,090
that's when we realized okay we make it

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:16,330
the read-only mode

00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,460
we removed edit functionality and that's

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,449
how we end up today what we currently

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,830
have in mind is to rework it or redesign

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,050
it completely to have more or less like

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,370
a result based solution where it could

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,919
create new rules and then you get

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,719
informed how many data will be

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,750
reshuffled for example if you apply

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:35,589
those rules through your cluster are you

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,219
really really sure

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:41,379
please I don't know kind of contact your

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,949
administrator your boss and someone else

00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:47,229
before you apply there after that two

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:50,199
years later the initial collaboration

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,279
started with Susie and the suitor once

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,500
we started that we added some initial

00:05:53,279 --> 00:06:01,240
graphing visualization of the theft

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,949
cluster some really basic stuff and only

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,449
a few months later in November obviously

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,879
we were the first acquisition ever made

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,710
by Susie I'm still not Hannibal the

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:14,439
insurers they've just tested us for a

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,389
few months and if this was just to trial

00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,580
okay we give them some money we test

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,740
them it's the team really a good idea or

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,050
should we buy them or not and then in

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,060
November finally they didn't bother us

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,219
that's not legal in Germany's I bought

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,839
the project and usually I don't know

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,640
surprisingly we are now part of Susie I

00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,430
know how it is relax

00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,040
here's a picture of the people Laura was

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,200
already there you're almost there from

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,370
the beginning right and so George I

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,470
don't know a few months after we

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,260
initially started 2011 and then then

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,200
2017 we're focusing on seven only since

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:57,680
automatic words and Sweden acts we focus

00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,810
on save only the reasons are really easy

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,480
because beforehand we supported Marie

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:05,120
distros like Debian Ubuntu sent us we

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,850
pulled several packages and edit all the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,880
functionalities now being part of a

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:15,350
bigger company with some kind of an

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,930
roadmap was a product behind yeah the

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:21,050
problem is we were still just nine nine

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,820
ten developers at least and supporting

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,990
all those different distributions plus

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,520
adding the whole features they told us

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,320
yeah I wasn't doable that's why we

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,270
traded off the money just for support

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,370
and also the local storage management so

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:37,420
we've removed the whole part so there's

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,830
nothing left in the current anymore

00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,800
that's how it ended up so the current

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,600
current automatic version 3.2 like that

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,660
this already includes Crisanta into the

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,760
UI and the back end or the data that

00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,730
crannis gathering is stored in a time

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,170
series data bank called promises and

00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,090
that's completely out in made

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,890
automatically deployed while a deep sea

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,860
if you use the salt based solution that

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:07,520
we have this whole stuff is set up

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,410
automatically so we talked about

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,730
automatic that's the rough history now

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,020
we're talking about that would be one

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,410
that's another natural thing to

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,090
understand the whole full picture

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,630
initially was def luminous there was the

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,780
so-called self management and we call

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,750
out the - put b1 you were able to see

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,220
some staff health some initial logs and

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,650
performance counters

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,220
also a list of fifties which was quite

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,470
nice as well as your images mirroring

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,110
although stuff back end was written in

00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,160
Python and used cherry pie and the front

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,180
end was written in rivets yes that's how

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,970
the whole thing started but

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,700
[Music]

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,959
this is just a picture how it looks like

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,880
or look like it wasn't remember that

00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,950
it's important later it wasn't black

00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,690
just keep that in mind I said it so I

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,310
will come to back to that later it's in

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,980
black

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,620
that's how it looks like and after

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,690
luminous was released they started to

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,880
adding new features actually W details

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,269
and monitoring this some Perth counters

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,949
as well as a browser to browse all the

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:19,160
configurations available was in a safe

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:20,990
cluster which was quite nifty the

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,690
problem was there 41 has some

00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,269
limitations first of all it was a read

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,889
or still was a read-only dashboard so

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,240
you couldn't manage enison you could

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,130
take a look at something but if you

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,980
would like to create an RPG device share

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,079
something that wasn't possible no

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,360
built-in authentication neither at least

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:40,130
and username or password doesn't matter

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,600
nothing everyone could just connect to

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:48,430
it and from our perspective limited

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,500
functionality was rivets yes that's

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,839
that's how we ended up with the next one

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:59,649
and the world I would like to hand over

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:07,490
to Laura so this is about the dashboard

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:09,829
v2 so it started in January 2018 that

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,420
there was a general discussion about the

00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:16,220
old - board in the future of that

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:18,670
dashboard and our idea was to contribute

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,839
the path that was already in all netic

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:26,510
as a new dashboard so dashboard v2 and

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,850
we discussed that with sage and John and

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:34,490
so we decided to create a proof of

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:38,089
concept and yeah then we decided to use

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,550
angular the other dashboard used another

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,399
technology but since we already used

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:47,240
Angela for automatic we decided to go

00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:50,930
with angular as well and yeah at the end

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,940
of February around there and the we

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,130
created a development branch for the

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,170
dashboard me too where we kind of

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,470
migrated all of our work from the

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:03,080
automatic from the old open it

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,930
to that development branch so we could

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:10,010
create a pull request against SEF with a

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:16,940
new dashboard replacement and yeah on

00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:21,230
March 6th we our yeah our version of the

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:25,460
dashboard was was merged and there we

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:28,610
had the feature come feature parity with

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:33,950
the dashboard v1 and yeah there we

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:39,020
submitted over 150 pull requests and 122

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:41,750
were merged and since we've merged that

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,990
first version of our dashboard we

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,230
already submitted over 170 pull requests

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,260
and more than hundred and forty pull

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,030
requests have been merged and yeah

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,180
currently there's a lot of groundwork

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:59,750
going on we have to build the foundation

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,450
for the for the new dashboard and here's

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,790
an overview of the dashboard what's

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,490
already there and what we use in the

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,100
back end we have Python and we use

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:13,430
cherry pie and as I mentioned we use

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,020
angular high for the WebP UI and yeah

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,040
because we already used that in open

00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:21,290
etic so we are a familiar with that and

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,860
currently we have user name and user

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,750
name and password for for the login and

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,790
yeah and as mentioned we have the

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,730
features that are in dashboard v1

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,240
already in our dashboard for the for the

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,590
master of Ceph and yeah there are

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,860
additional management features

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:43,100
integrated but also some we are still

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,730
working on so what we have in the back

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,640
end what we built on top of the

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:52,610
dashboard v1 version is a task

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,030
management we have a browsable REST API

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,270
but that is also currently being changed

00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,090
again with a new replacement and we have

00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,120
our BDD management we have our GW

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:09,680
package and user management and safe

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,340
pool management there is also in the

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,650
front-end

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,340
for example the the self-full management

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,120
and the

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:19,940
vd management we have the rgw management

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,060
in the front and arational called pool

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:27,020
profile management and the task manager

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,360
as well you have just you have a window

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,510
where you could see running tasks

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,130
because if a task takes longer then yeah

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,950
just creating something and you can

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,930
instantly see it then you have a small

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:42,410
pop-up window where you can see the

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,150
progress of that task so just to inform

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,180
the user that is something that it that

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,850
takes longer and us going on we have

00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,250
tooltips so if you go over with the

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:56,690
mouse over some some items you get

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:59,090
additional information about it and we

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:03,130
also have a usage by a component to a

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:07,180
show some some graphs in the UI and

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:10,040
what's next is the craft HANA proxy

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,350
there is something for the work which is

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,480
being developed for the back end so we

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,170
can then integrate rafen onto the front

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,420
end still safe pool management is in

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,290
progress so we can edit pools for

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:27,470
example what is also in progress is for

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,530
the backend currently classified SEF OSD

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:35,150
management so we can set set flex for

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:37,100
OSD which are then applied classified we

00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,490
have a settings edit or there's also

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,860
work in progress there is a page where

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,180
you can see all settings from the

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:50,030
cluster that are yeah active currently

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:53,660
the plan is to have that as an editor so

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:56,710
you can change SEF configuration

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,540
settings in in that page also

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,820
translation localization is a topic so

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:06,500
we have the Deaf port and different

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:10,160
languages currently Spanish is being it

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,520
is being translated to Spanish yeah we

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,680
have also German and yeah if you or if

00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,200
someone wants to contribute with

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,220
localization that is also something we

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,730
appreciate and what's also next is user

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,050
permissions so you can set user

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,779
permissions for

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,660
example four at actions or edit actions

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:34,339
if you want to create something or if

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,709
you want to delete something so we

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,560
wanted to the idea was to have that per

00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,810
page so you can allow a user to go to

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,140
the pool's page and create a pool or you

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,589
can yet just unset that and the users

00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,330
not really allowed to do something on

00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:54,140
that page except for yeah kind of

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:58,700
read-only that is also something that is

00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:05,320
being worked on so I don't know if we

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,320
have like with the yeah with the Wi-Fi

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
one thing may be worth to mention is

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,220
right now what we're trying to achieve

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,070
is we try to convert or to reach feature

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,050
parity with the old automatic so all the

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,520
functionalities that we have have two

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,220
management facilities we would try it

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,450
right now we try to port them into the

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,130
new upstream included dashboard there

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,250
are some problems that we're currently

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,079
facing because we have to choose a

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,120
Orchestrator somehow or make it more

00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,560
less modular that we can can support

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,880
multiple deployment tools like sensible

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,860
various transcripts whatever and deep

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,420
sea for example fault based our fault

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,399
based version from loser so to support

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,230
all of them and that's what we're

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,420
currently trying to achieve and as soon

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,670
as we achieve that we will add more and

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,649
more functionality on top but from our

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:59,000
end the cool stuff is that as soon as

00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,010
you now install Ceph mimic you will get

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,570
the dashboard but he falls and there's

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,030
no third party dashboard needed anymore

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,800
and this wall i'm definitely improved

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,170
for Nautilus which is planned to be

00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,559
released by the beginning of first

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:15,319
quarter next year so just as a heads up

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:22,130
let's take a look of my wife's reckon or

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:24,319
not yay should I press f5 I don't know I

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,439
just show you the login page because we

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,010
have one and if the Wi-Fi is not working

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,840
anymore

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,660
it's awesome right so this is how what I

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:38,540
can show you let me try to log in in my

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,240
former talks I did it I did the bad joke

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,510
that our old logins

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,460
Ben looked completely the same the only

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,530
thing that was different was the logo

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,090
and the name it was welcome to automatic

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,570
instead of welcome to Seth in the local

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,070
was different and then a former

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,510
presentations I just showed this as the

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,050
newest thing that we've develop and

00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:01,920
that's it so that's cool let's try to

00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,650
log on please please yeah amazing and

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,760
one thing to mention I mention it you

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:12,250
know what yay exactly and this already

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,809
started several conversations I hate

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,429
those conversations but there are there

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,410
are several conversations because seems

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,290
like a lot of people like like the old

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,540
black color and I know that someone is

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,400
already working on the seeming PR just

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,100
to make it possible to change the colors

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,450
up - yeah UI because why not that's the

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,500
most important part that we should work

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,820
on obviously given that we are now based

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,550
on the old or that we try to

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,520
re-implement the old dashboard it looks

00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:42,309
totally familiar we haven't at least an

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,860
overview overall health status you get

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,830
how I get a list of how many monitors do

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:50,140
you have to quorum how many OS these

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,150
lists of pools then the usage bar with

00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,100
an over this cool little tool tip that's

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:58,179
something that we've added that wasn't

00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,510
part of the old - port v1 and then

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:04,420
something that OPA medic does not have

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,040
is those locks so you directly get a

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,170
class to log and audit log form the

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,510
cluster so you can click on and get

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,630
direct information from the cluster so

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:18,280
this part is already ahead of what

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:22,600
automatic is capable of let's switch to

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,390
the cluster topic or cluster tab there

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,920
we have several tabs for example a hosts

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,260
there you have just list of hosts

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,840
including the services there's nothing

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,760
more in it yet this will change as soon

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,790
as we have the orchestrator and we can

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,200
talk to the notes and we can then

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,390
interact with them and do specific

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,679
operations on them right now it's just

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:46,929
what possible from class source we have

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:50,290
a list of monitors so as Lisa getting

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,370
broader general overview then you get a

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,590
list of

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,049
monetarist you would get those monitors

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:59,620
which are not a quorum because they are

00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:02,320
down or have other several problems you

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,020
get a list of open sessions sex six

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,150
things connected that's amazing you get

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,929
their addresses and then you can click

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:13,240
for example on a specific Mon Mon a and

00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:16,360
then you get some details performance

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,070
counters from this one most of most of

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,260
them are ng because this is a

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,910
development system development branch

00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,110
and I just thought it to be star cluster

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:29,260
so there's nothing behind

00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,360
OST tab we can can list the orestes all

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,190
of them then we added those usage things

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,630
to reach right paths I not quite sure if

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,320
you have seen that they update

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,179
automatically same from right bytes you

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,360
get the status of them and underneath

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:48,309
you get those OSD map so you get some

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,530
details from the OSD specifically as

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:53,740
well as you can get details for the

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:56,140
metadata same for performance counters

00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,100
so you get get some data for this

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:03,789
specific OS the ID 0 one was collected

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,289
and then the histogram this was part of

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:08,230
that would be one who's implemented so

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:12,809
maybe we have to redesign that but as I

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:15,070
said we converted it so that's for USD

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,169
the cool thing that's what we mentioned

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,809
was the configuration browser and I hope

00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:21,250
my wife is still working seems like

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,970
seems like not I don't know

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,970
at least I wanted to show you if it's

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,100
not possible I will explain what it does

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,620
it will list unknown arrow that's

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,900
amazing it will list all configuration

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,000
items and was in your cluster and the

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,610
cool thing is you can't can change the

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,380
level so you have at least a basic level

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,730
at once in a development level so in the

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,370
basic level you get I don't know if you

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,159
select no st you get four different

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,440
different variables you can change four

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,530
values if you change to advanced you get

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,419
I don't know 50 and development 100 so

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,870
that's the idea and what we're currently

00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:01,360
working on is the editor of this

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,530
configuration list that we have right

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,419
here but plus

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,159
we would like to show the default how

00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,380
the default looks like and then mark

00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,090
those you have changed manually mark

00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,850
them red or highlight them that you know

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,679
okay I changed those variables and maybe

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,520
cuz of given reasons and then you can

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,960
also adapt and change that's cool for

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:31,130
life doing that's always the case right

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:34,220
seems like flop I had Wi-Fi once I still

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:38,210
have oh my VPN dropped a case of reason

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:40,130
let me give it a try to reconnect don't

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,299
we have someone here from from Susan

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:46,190
frog who can fix it

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:48,710
just kidding let me see if I

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,679
I can I can it right let me create an

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,700
internal ticket yeah that's possible

00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,559
please send me an email that they

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,929
exchanged or whatever server is down yes

00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:03,440
of course is a great idea

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:07,010
chicken-and-egg it's connecting do I

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:11,840
have do I have Wi-Fi here or do I have

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,640
at least you have let me let me let me

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,380
create a hotspot we are flexible right

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,919
we are kind of agile so I create an

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,929
hotspot

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,820
I don't care let me change let me check

00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:25,510
and then now I have each wire that would

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,510
be amazing

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:39,920
let me connect and let me check yeah my

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,550
heart

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,670
but it's working round of applause as

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:49,160
amazing let me check if it's thought if

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,740
it's broken or if it's not and there is

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,230
the configuration edit or or no just

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:57,910
browser sorry I'm back

00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,590
thank you mobile device and 21st century

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:05,150
that's what I tried to what I try to

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:07,340
explain this is how the general yeah

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:10,870
overview of the configuration management

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,580
looks like let me let me select Samsung

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:17,300
for example I click on OSD as I said I

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,430
had a level of basic I just get two

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,770
options I could change cluster tress

00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,720
public address and then if I'm more

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,540
serious I can change to advance for

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,940
example and then I get more details and

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,700
there's another page you can go to and

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,250
get more informations and there are

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,040
several ones be sure so if you're really

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:41,000
serious you can do a lot of really cool

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,410
stuff here so let's switch to pool we

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,550
are listing all the pools that we have

00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:49,100
within a cluster and also we're listing

00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:52,160
the details of the pools underneath so

00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,760
how many how's the PG PG noms or how

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,150
many PG is this pool have for example or

00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,570
also some performance counters yeah

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,950
that's for at least that's four pools

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:08,900
one thing I can show what we had from a

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:11,180
management your perspective is with

00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,960
unblock the block tab we're not able to

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,750
create RVD images and one thing we've

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,710
we've added as well is the possibility

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:23,570
to create snapshots of those RBG's so if

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,580
I click on snapshot I here I have an

00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:28,580
overview of those snapshots I just

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:31,430
created this head snap and this snap for

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,920
example right now is protected and if I

00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,240
want to unprotect it I can click on then

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,550
you'll see you creates a long running

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,950
tasks but longer get a notification and

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,990
it's unprotected so that's something we

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,400
we've developed and if you want to for

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:49,760
example create a new one you can click

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:51,680
on add I mean new OS c RB d it is cool

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,330
or AC or midi

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,920
200 max you can also change the features

00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,960
for example in here we have some kind of

00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,520
dependencies included if you have seen

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,850
automatic before this was there already

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,940
the fact but for example object map

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,730
requires exclusive locks so as soon as I

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,190
remove exclusive lock all of the others

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,170
were automatically unchecked and as soon

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,180
as I click on exclusive flop I can turn

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,590
on object map and test this again as

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:23,630
well let me create this hotspot is

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,510
working quite well and there it is my

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:32,330
new OSD are ready for example and now I

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:34,310
can create Navi create a snapshot and

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,840
then it will create a snapshot on top of

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,490
this already that's for example a

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,460
functionality with that we are already

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:46,280
headed that's ahead of v1 file system

00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,690
now there are more I can show you there

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,790
is the mirroring the I Scottie page this

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,670
was already part of v1 but given that I

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:56,690
neither configure the mirror nor ice

00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,370
caddy I can show you empty lists so as

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,140
soon as you have I have a mirror

00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,360
configured or a nice cozy gateway you

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,680
have something that given that usually

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,940
what we do is just checking out the

00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,340
current master and then we starting

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,980
restart cluster which data which sets up

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,300
a bare minimum cluster for development

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,160
proposes

00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:17,840
yeah it's just overhead to deploy

00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:21,320
everson file system we are able to show

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,350
the file system so this ffs on top they

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,900
can also you can also listed science how

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,090
many which are connected and also the

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,710
ranks of the client so one thing that's

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,480
maybe interesting in or you're

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,340
interested in is as soon as you have

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,230
more than just one two or three clients

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:41,240
you maybe want to know who of my clients

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,590
is the one who is I don't know training

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,120
down my whole class so all the time

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,670
because he's totally freaking out and

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,860
doing some weird things so there you get

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:53,210
a list of reads and writes at least four

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,590
specific notes ten minutes before our

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,360
talk I figured out that I can show you

00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,000
something else the object gateway but

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,580
not object gateway I wanted to show you

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,040
but one thing that we've added and that

00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,760
those are those hints and knows

00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:10,280
so if something is not working we try to

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,220
add some hints or some guidelines how to

00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,730
configure it and here you can see if you

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,110
can read it there you get an information

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,690
and the direct link to the documentation

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:24,200
how to configure the object gateway for

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,060
example I just have seen this five

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,330
minutes before before I start my talk

00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,800
seems like my rtw crashed on my laptop

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:33,320
maybe for the best system to host the

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,420
first master but just that you know

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:40,370
we're trying to make it as easy usable

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:42,140
as possible when you click on the link

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,120
just that you have seen that like an

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,460
opening you pay a new tab this will

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,650
directly redirect you for example - port

00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,060
plugin how do you configure enabling the

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:53,480
object gateway management from then

00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,470
within documentation so no need to just

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,430
I don't know walk through the whole

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,290
documentation use Google or at least

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:04,430
read the documentation I know people

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,650
hate to read documentation background

00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,510
tasks just to show you that that's what

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,880
I did before I created for example a

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,920
snapshot on top of this new SD already

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,350
called snappy and there you can see all

00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,970
the tasks that I've done and also the

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,820
recent notifications we have seen this

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:24,100
error we got before those are listed

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,100
here so we have a clue what was going on

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,540
that's a general quick walkthrough as

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,580
you have seen if someone has seen the

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,200
OBE medic UI beforehand what's missing

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,360
of course the CI Scottie management

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,370
what's missing is an estimate management

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,850
and the whole pool management for

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,820
example

00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:43,400
yes Laura pointed out this pull requests

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:47,360
already created working on it and for

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:50,480
the whole management stuff our hope goes

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,220
to into John that it's done sooner than

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,340
later so that's how an upstream project

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,140
works so that to be totally honest I'm

00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,920
really really happy that we were able to

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:03,140
convince our internal I would say

00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,120
managers that we can what can push

00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,070
efforts in upstream and that sage at

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,550
least allowed us to do though so now we

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,260
have roughly between ten eleven as from

00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:16,670
developers working on a dashboard and

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,600
was even better before hand we tried to

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,610
build up a community

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,190
medic which was rather complicated

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:25,610
because the contributions to automatic

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:28,430
were quite low or I would say not

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:30,380
existent at all and this completely

00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,210
changed and we initially merged the

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,130
applicant or requesting to sell so we

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,840
now have folks from Red Hat working on a

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,360
dashboard as well we get new pull

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,850
requests we get fixes this is totally

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,370
amazing so I'm I'm really looking

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,110
forward to I don't know make this UI as

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,920
usable as possible and therefore we need

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:50,660
your feedback so please use it just take

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,070
a look at it I know their management

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,860
functionality is almost missing right

00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,990
now but initial feedback is helpful and

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,150
if it's I want the flexing back

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,010
something like that just feedback that

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,040
we know ok what could be improved what

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:08,000
is missing maybe just contact us that

00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:10,850
would be helpful and with that that I

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,530
think we were at the end and we're kind

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:16,070
of asked question right let's switch

00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:17,930
back to here I don't know if someone

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,350
someone has questions about the demo I

00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,060
would

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,030
I will not fullscreen this presentation

00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:36,560
now again so now it's question time if

00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:40,430
you have questions ask them so you want

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:44,300
people to test it out etc how much of

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:47,720
this is in tumbleweed or would you have

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,060
to then do a get pull from upstream to

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,250
then try and test the new one or do you

00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:58,070
have a development repository within OBS

00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:02,510
that people can take a package from test

00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:05,600
it and provide feedback currently we

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:08,960
have was only it was an O PS or we try

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,960
to be as you're up to date as possible

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,490
so we have packages most recent packages

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,760
for luminous and we already have

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,710
packages for mimic the mimic what branch

00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,960
of two weeks ago or so so we have

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:24,020
current current packages or we don't

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,820
have is up to date up to date right now

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,100
packages from master so we don't build

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,500
masters for every change so we built

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,430
them regularly I don't know once or

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,260
twice a week

00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,390
like that but not everyday so if you

00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,470
want up-to-date right now then you will

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:42,740
have to check out from github more

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:46,490
questions so we think we have time left

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:50,450
though yeah questions or as everyone

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,950
totally confused or you can ask a

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,120
general question if you would like

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:58,330
otherwise I don't want to steal your

00:32:53,120 --> 00:33:01,790
time we can also wrap up so last chance

00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:03,800
then thank you very much for attending

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,630
this presentation and thanks to Laura

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,630
for helping me with

00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,750
