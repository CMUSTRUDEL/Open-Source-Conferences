Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - Ceph Manager Dashboard
Publication date: 2018-05-25

Description: 
	How do I manage such a big cluster?

The original Ceph Manager Dashboard that was introduced in Ceph "Luminous" started out as a simple, read-only view into various run-time information and performance data of a Ceph cluster, without authentication or any administrative functionality.

However, as it turns out, there is a growing demand for adding more web-based management capabilities, to make it easier for administrators that prefer a WebUI to manage Ceph over the command line.

After learning about this, we - the openATTIC team - approached upstream and offered our help to implement the missing functionality. Based on our experiences in developing the Ceph support in openATTIC, we think we have a lot to offer in the form of code and experience in creating a Ceph administration and monitoring UI.

We already reached feature parity and replaced the existing dashboard mgr module and we're moving forward. If you want to learn more about it this is the right talk for you.
