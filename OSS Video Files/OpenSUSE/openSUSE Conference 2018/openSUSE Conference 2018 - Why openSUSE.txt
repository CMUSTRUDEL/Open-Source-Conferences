Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	About ideal use case and promoting the gold triangle of openSUSE

This talks is split in three topics:

1. openSUSE is not SUSE, it is her sister.
  There are still too much people outside of open/SUSE world that still confuse the difference and the options they have. This usually leads them to use the wrong distribution for their use cases and thinking that "SUSE" is not working for them.
  I will describe the current distribution palette and their respective key values and the difference from the SUSE company and openSUSE community.

2. Why should I use openSUSE?
  I will describe which features from openSUSE make it ideal for which use case. A brief description of what I personally name the gold triangle of openSUSE is mandatory (OBS, openQA, Yast).

3. How to contribute to openSUSE
  I will describe the workflow to contribute to openSUSE, new packages and maintenance, and how OBS and openQA are involved.
