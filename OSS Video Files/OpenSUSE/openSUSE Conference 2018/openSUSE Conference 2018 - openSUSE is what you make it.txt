Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - openSUSE is what you make it
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	How to change anything you want in the project

This talk is for openSUSE's aspiring new contributors, existing contributors, users, detractors, or just anyone curious at all about openSUSE. In other words, if you're at this conference, you should consider being at this talk ;)

The session will detail how openSUSE does what it does, and most importantly how openSUSE strives to empower ANYONE to be able to contribute to the project.

The presentation will outline examples of not only basic contributions to the distributions (Leap & Tumbleweed), but also explain through example and anecdote how anyone can influence, steer, and drive the direction of the openSUSE Project, including changing the scope of the Project by introducing new sub projects.

The session will end with a Q&A section for anyone to ask any question about contributing to the project in general, to provide feedback on any potential improvements to openSUSE's current contribution story, or to ask those first questions about that first contribution so that YOU can start making openSUSE YOURS.

okay then thank you all for coming

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,960
I'm Richard this is Jerry we're both

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,990
from Susie's future technology team

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,609
I've also openSUSE chairman so I guess I

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,699
felt that was nicer to write on this

00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:22,869
slide but yeah and yeah we're here to

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,539
talk about sort of how to change

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:27,880
anything in the openSUSE project how you

00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,929
can get involved infinitely give a bit

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,230
of a sort of the philosophy behind

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:34,570
contributing in openSUSE so obviously

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,890
we're at the openSUSE conference we all

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,410
know where we came from we had the

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,260
keynote this morning you know originally

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,020
started as an open project promoting the

00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,260
use of Linux everywhere and you started

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,620
2015 so you know we're not old we're

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,100
we're classic and a little bit hippie

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,300
especially these days where yeah like

00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,700
Wojtek explained in the cool this

00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,020
morning the session this morning you

00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,280
know openSUSE really has this sort of

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,980
freedom to go and do what it's once

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,329
separate from what susur's yeah several

00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,000
whatever Sue's is doing on their their

00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:08,620
Enterprise side of things which means

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,909
when I start talking about openSUSE now

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,100
you know I used to just talk about

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,480
openSUSE the distribution but if you

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,270
look at the openSUSE project today

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,870
it's a project made out of many many

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,270
many projects in fact this slide is is

00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,220
woefully out of date and them I can

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,390
sneak peek that tomorrow it'll be even

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,970
more out of date because there'll be

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,610
something else to add to this slide and

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,710
the question then becomes like how did

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,320
we end up with this complicated mess you

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,760
know what mess arrangement you know

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,549
you've got all these different projects

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,520
how how did that happen how the projects

00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,190
get involved in openSUSE what is

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,250
openSUSE when you've got all this stuff

00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,390
underneath it and really at the heart of

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,799
that at the beginning of all of that

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,659
there is kind of one of these

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,600
fundamental truths of open source which

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,640
is equally true if not more true and

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,110
openSUSE than in many other places that

00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,250
in every contribution every developer

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,470
every person involved in openSUSE is

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,149
there because they've got some itch to

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,370
scratch they know what they want to fix

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,130
they generally have an idea on how they

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,959
want to fix it and so that the thing

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,220
with openSUSE is really case if we want

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,010
to

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,780
to be a project where we can get them

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,120
involved we can capture them into a

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,590
sphere of influence so you know they can

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,470
help what we're interested in as a

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,430
collective group and yeah ultimately

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,100
thinking it from a from a sort of

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,140
broader project perspective as we have

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,530
this whole diverse family of software in

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,180
our distribution you know when something

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,730
does go wrong when something doesn't get

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,960
fixed you know ultimately yeah if a

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,290
volunteer doesn't fix it you're gonna

00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,170
have to find somebody and that can be a

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,490
pain so you know you don't want to have

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,190
broken things lurking around your

00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,310
project code base for a long time so you

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,620
know projects must provide value and and

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,240
in time rewards for value of time for

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,910
its contributions everything that's

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:11,730
coming to these contributions and as a

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,550
volunteer community you know it's

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,240
important to realize where that sort of

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,500
decision-making power comes from whether

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,690
you know who should be deciding what

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,459
needs to be done you know the best

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,570
person to decide anything in my opinion

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,370
is the person doing that thing the

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,680
volunteer involved in that you know the

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,090
the role of the project isn't there to

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,550
tell people what they need to do the

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,630
role of an open-source project should be

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,790
to give them the tools and the

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,500
environment to be able to do that to

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,360
really empower them so they can get on

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,870
and change what they want to change in

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,260
that project and even if you did try to

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,310
tell them what you wanted them to do

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,140
quite often contributors are like

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,150
donkeys

00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,570
that's stubborn they won't do it anyway

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,810
so why does so many open-source projects

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,150
try you know we used to an openSUSE we

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,560
don't anymore we generally don't try and

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,320
force people to go and work on these

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,060
features we just try and show the

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,650
situation as it is and hope people come

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,650
in and get involved and fix things so

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,510
new contributors should be able to

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,140
pretty much start from day one as a

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,130
walking talking part of the project you

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,280
know they should know what they'd be at

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,080
yeah get involved get started and we had

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,640
to go sort of straight from birth to

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,259
being an active contributor in the

00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,389
project

00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,100
so how do we do that in openSUSE you've

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,479
heard it in fact I've seen at least one

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,180
talk where this was already mentioned

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,789
you know those that do decide and the

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,880
core principle of how contribution works

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:47,520
in openSUSE if you're doing something in

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,389
openSUSE you decide what gets done in

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,400
open season and yeah that's yeah rule

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,520
number one we really should be talking

00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,330
about that far more often but what does

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,229
it mean in practice with my slide flop

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,729
showing here now sorry yeah well like I

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:08,400
said it works best when the contributor

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,710
doing the work is the one in power to

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,080
decide what to do that doesn't mean

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,970
doing everything on your own

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,650
you know teamwork helps you know you

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,720
need to spread that load more than yeah

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,639
across yeah across more than one person

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,900
you don't want to be I don't want to

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,190
have a situation where one person gets

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,720
sick or one person leaves a project and

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,380
an entire part of your project falls

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,509
apart but how those therefore you want

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,210
to pull people together into teams but

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:35,460
how those teams work again isn't a

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,260
cookie cutter model if you think of

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,789
something like openSUSE will be dealing

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,220
with many different up streams and many

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,870
different components in the project all

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,370
of these have different requirements up

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,400
streams release things at different

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,050
paces Python works a different way than

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,990
Ruby does and how they release all their

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,970
modules and they're like so how those

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,470
teams inside openSUSE that are dealing

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,229
with that should have the freedom to

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,720
decide how to organize themselves how to

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:02,220
release their software and it shouldn't

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,250
all just be kind of forced into one

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,840
unified messy funnel if you know you

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:12,090
must work in this way but you do need to

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,669
have some common standards you know and

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,340
that's one thing we do a really huge

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,229
amount inside openSUSE but implementing

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,820
that is is generally done by consensus

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,009
you know anybody can contribute to open

00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,229
QA to decide the release criteria for

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,729
what we release via open QA you know

00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:30,120
anybody can contribute to what we do in

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,500
OBS and even even our spec leaning tools

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,659
they're all open source they're all

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,250
there so it's all available to be worked

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:40,610
on collaboratively and then those few

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,490
senior people acting as gatekeepers are

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,199
just there

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,759
act as gatekeepers enforcing the

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,259
criteria that the community as a

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,000
collective have already decided so

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:52,210
there's no kind of grand overarching

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,560
overlord you know we collectively come

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,599
up with the rules and then these poor

00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,610
guys volunteer to make sure we stick to

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,650
them so that means anybody can

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,740
contribute to openSUSE right they're out

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,960
they want no requesting permission no

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,819
asking for a sort of maintainer ship of

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,389
a certain package anybody can log into

00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,770
OBS they can get an account they can

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:21,370
immediately start working on our code

00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:23,949
base and that means when it comes to

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,509
sort of who's in charge of openSUSE it's

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,400
your contributions that really do the

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,960
talking you know automatic OBS checks

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,210
make sure things work keep on working

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,370
and and you know so functionally testing

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,080
so the question when it comes to you

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,460
know do we accept this change isn't the

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,349
case of you know does this fit with our

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,000
product division or does this fit with

00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,550
you know Souza's goals which we'll talk

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,620
about more later it's really a case of

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,120
you know will this thing work well this

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,599
thing causes more of a headache down the

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,789
road which is a way easier frame of mind

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,240
to be approaching random contributions

00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,580
from a broad community and because we

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,229
have that mindset we don't fall into

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,150
this trap that many other projects have

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,090
of having steering committees

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,039
engineering councils product managers

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:12,069
project managers benevolent dictators

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,840
for life all of that is unnecessary you

00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,580
know from Sousa and I think that is an

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,610
incredibly good thing it makes us

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,639
incredibly agile and incredibly flexible

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,169
and it avoids problems like certain

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,969
distributions had with things like

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,849
systemd if you look at examples like

00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,800
Debian systemd did not have an easy time

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,969
getting itself into Debian there was

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,589
lots of people who wanted it there was

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:36,940
lots of people who didn't flame wars

00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:39,039
erupted I'm getting openSUSE we were the

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,849
first distribution to actually add air

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,740
adopt systemd and nobody really argued

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,300
with it because a contributor did all

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,420
the work all contributors did all of the

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,699
work it was there it was merged it

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,920
worked it worked well enough that we

00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:56,770
made it the default eventually there you

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,209
know peace happiness mostly I mean okay

00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,350
occasional mailing lists say more

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,020
because some people still don't like it

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,050
but it's hard to argue with the fact

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,209
that it's there and it's working and

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,190
that means openSUSE is an incredibly

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,660
agile project these days you know we can

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,850
adopt new technologies new ideas

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,910
whatever the crazy thing you want to

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,130
work on incredibly quickly and yet we're

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,890
all so flexible to kind of not do

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,449
anything in one standard consistent pace

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,130
or one standard consistent way of doing

00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:26,650
things see there are in tumbleweed for

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,240
example there are cases where we are the

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,740
fastest distribution of the planets and

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,870
there's other cases in bumble weed

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,400
well we've significantly behind the

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,020
curve because that's the pace that our

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,000
contributors who decided they wanted to

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,699
run tumbleweed at and that what makes

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,079
sense because you know that upstream is

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:42,820
a little bit too crazy and their latest

00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,260
version is a little bit too broken and

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,020
therefore it's best for tumbleweed to be

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,790
you know that little bit further behind

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,470
so which you know ultimately means we

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,420
have a better distribution to give to

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,350
our users at the end and yeah as I've

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,060
already said there's sort of no

00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,620
restrictions on finding in an innovative

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,959
solution sometimes there have been stuff

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,940
done in openSUSE which if we had

00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,920
destruct criteria if we had stricter

00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,350
sort of project management of product

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,880
controls you wouldn't do it that way but

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,670
it makes sense for our contributors it

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,270
works so we accept it and it works and

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,820
they maintain it and talk yeah until

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,339
them but it's not all perfect

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,339
it does have some challenges with this

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:26,470
mindset this freedom does cause sort of

00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:29,070
a paralysis of choice you can do

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,160
anything in openSUSE so what do you do

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,630
and yeah that does especially new

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,220
volunteers that sometimes scare them

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,750
away that is one of the reasons why I'm

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,270
doing this presentation to kind of show

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:42,160
that it's you know it's not that scary

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,190
it's not that intimidating you can just

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,230
pick way one thing you want to work on

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,940
it does sometimes also have a habit of

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,580
misconceptions as established

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,740
contributors kind of get seen as guys

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,770
who know everything and making all the

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,090
decisions and you know it's not true

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,230
really not true I have no idea what I'm

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,090
doing most of the time and yeah it's

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,130
important to realize that you can just

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,790
come to openSUSE with a brand new idea

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:11,050
you can rock the boat please do it keeps

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,860
us honest and makes things more

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,370
interesting we really need that you know

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,990
keep the project moving forward but then

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,510
there is of course at some point what do

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,340
you do when one contributor or one group

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,680
of contributors has a different idea

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,990
that is fundamentally incompatible with

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,920
a different set of contributors deadlock

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:35,200
is a real risk in this model and so you

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,860
need to have what I refer to here is

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,970
some kind of organizational checksum

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,560
because you know you don't want

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:48,070
developers fighting in the street and in

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,220
the past we've and in other projects

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,120
there's a tendency to I'm skipping ahead

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,900
of slide yeah

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,640
conflicts happen so volunteers a human

00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,830
mostly I mean okay we do have a couple

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,330
of bots in openSUSE that people think a

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,280
human and keep on replying to emails

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,220
from but you know generally speaking of

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,550
volunteers a human they have different

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:13,570
ideas and sometimes compromises can be

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,010
incredibly hard to find and when those

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,720
conflicts happen between developers

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,730
there's a real strong tendency in

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,010
open-source projects to see them as

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:24,430
technical discussions or technical

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,500
decisions and you see you know this is

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,450
where I think so many mailing list flame

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,950
will start in so many different projects

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,650
of the debating you know the technical

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,060
my new sure of this way is better versus

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,840
that way and this is right and this is

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,910
wrong the the openSUSE view at least the

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,710
openSUSE board's view on this is this

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,140
isn't the technical problem if you have

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,670
competing ideas and competing arguments

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,290
to the point where you know you can't

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,960
find a way of getting along in your

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,060
project it's not a technical issue it's

00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,070
a human one you have people who are

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,020
disagreeing and you know you need to

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,960
deal with the people not the technical

00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,210
bit there's no

00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,550
you know it doesn't matter which

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,260
technical solution is best in the open

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,690
source world more often than not in fact

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,000
the best technical solutions don't when

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,080
it's the motivated ones because they're

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,100
the ones that have the contributions

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,630
behind it they're the ones that are

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,780
going to keep on developing six months

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,050
or a year from now so who cares which is

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,610
technically the best one it really

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,080
matters which one has the people behind

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,930
it and which one you know can you get

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,180
the most motivation behind it so it

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,620
needs a human touch you need to listen

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,760
to all sides involved they need to

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,200
realize they're heard and you need to

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,450
kind of look at it from a very mature

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,550
and interpersonal and a sort of

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,550
emotional one not a technical one

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,220
sometimes ultimately even looking at

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,780
order that sometimes a decision has to

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,400
be made you know sometimes things get so

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,740
split that you know you do have to make

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:53,330
a hot there yeah make a final decision

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:55,160
on the topic and you know ultimately you

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,270
know that's a really awkward position to

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,580
be in because at some point you know

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:01,970
you're basically meaning someone's gonna

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,030
be told what they have to do and it's an

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,270
absolute last resort but in in openSUSE

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,670
we have a group of volunteers who are

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:13,730
responsible for being that last resort

00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:17,650
you know if you have a problem no one

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,800
else can help who do you call the a-team

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,350
seriously

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,000
the openSUSE board and that's the role

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,560
the openSUSE board are the main role the

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
openSUSE board place in the project as

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,790
that escalation point when those things

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,730
get stuck you can contact border

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,010
openSUSE dorg will step in will try and

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,900
help out we'll try and smooth the waves

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,200
and sort out that interpersonal problem

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,550
and if we can't we'll be the horrible

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,880
people making the final decision so

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,890
everybody can blame us and no one else

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,930
so yeah so the environments there

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,910
anybody can contribute to openSUSE but

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,540
how do you get started how do you sort

00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:00,530
of get involved and yeah actually in

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,110
bear terms do stuff and this is

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,000
surprisingly non-technical I'm on

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,640
purpose these next slides I didn't want

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,800
to go into great detail about putting

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,260
stuff into into OBS or putting stuff

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,670
into open QA

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,620
we have this broad family of different

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,720
projects if this this is the kind of the

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,660
high level view of regardless of which

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,170
project my advice on how to get involved

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,180
in an open Sousa project and to reflect

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,800
that I won't let this slide say up there

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,170
too long but you know when this is all

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,670
uploaded you know we have a bunch of

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,170
different mailing lists we have a bunch

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,320
of different IRC channels that's the

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,360
best way of getting in touch initially

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,380
with our contributors with our projects

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,250
with those teams the list is even longer

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,620
obviously that's why I've listed like

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:47,110
lists openSUSE Dorgan all of our free

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,460
node channels you know those teams do

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,530
all stat around that but it's nice to

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,690
know this is generally speaking most of

00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,190
the project is mailing lists and IRC

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,380
centric with a good chunk of github

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,070
these days as well which I realize I

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:03,390
forgot to put on there the starting

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:06,840
point is really doing your homework

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,250
figuring out what do you want to do

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,930
understand what your problem is the

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,600
topic you want to fix whatever it is

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,460
don't make assumptions don't read the

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,780
register and other news articles and

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,130
think those journalists know what

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,270
they're talking about to really figure

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,460
out the problem from your perspective of

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,680
what needs to be fixed in openSUSE so

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,080
you know do your research have a look at

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,030
the openSUSE wiki have a look at the art

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,950
wiki have a look at anyone else's

00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,610
projects what is what is the rest of the

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,650
open-source world doing and figure out

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,160
how you want to see that implemented in

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,930
openSUSE and and start at this point the

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,580
discussion you know this is what open

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,080
Caeser I've opened is a conference I've

00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,560
been doing this already for the bill

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,390
this morning

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,490
you know bounce these ideas off other

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,650
people start just getting a feel for

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,850
what other people think about what

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,720
you're thinking of what you want to

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,310
change and yet really skidders sort of

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,840
strong base of knowledge that you have

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,220
understood the problem that you're

00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:10,000
trying to fix and then carry on doing a

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:12,820
little bit more homework you know have

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,770
some rough plan for how you want to fix

00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,420
it you know what do you want the end go

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,370
to look like you don't have to have all

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,480
of the details in fact the details will

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,000
change anyway when you start

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,740
implementing it but have a rough idea of

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,760
what you want the final outcome to be

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,310
and where

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,340
you want the project to look when you're

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,680
done the details are totally nicely

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,480
optional but you need to have a rough

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,160
idea of this because this is the bit you

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
really need to start when you start

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,530
explaining it to other people you know

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,020
how are you gonna get more people

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:44,410
involved to work with you on this crazy

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,910
plan that is if you want anybody to help

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,450
you if you think you know what you're

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,460
doing

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,830
you figured out your plan you don't get

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,380
anybody to help you then just do it

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,850
there's no you know no like you said no

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,700
permission required everything's already

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,590
open just contribute but if you do need

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:05,200
help then you need to share it with the

00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:07,510
project and so at least for the

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:16,990
distributions the best place for that is

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:18,580
is okay okay fine anyway yeah if you're

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,990
working on the distributions the best

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,720
place for that is the openSUSE Factory

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,790
mailing list and basically present your

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,010
idea present the plan you know basically

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,060
present your couple of paragraphs of

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,990
homework from everything you've been

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:33,040
thinking about and avoid presenting it

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,110
as an open question

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,440
don't ask what do you think of this

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,420
because you will get 500 answers and

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,900
none of them will be helpful most of

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,430
they'll be negative you know present it

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,450
from the point of view if this is what

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm going to do and this is how I intend

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,480
to do it because if you do it that way

00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,250
then it's now the community's

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,110
responsibility to stop you and as

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,360
confrontational as that may sound it

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,230
actually ends up really focusing that

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,970
feedback so you're going to get decent

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,070
constructive or more useful feedback of

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,310
why you shouldn't do things that way and

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,560
how you should be doing it differently

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,690
and that I've seen time and time again

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,640
when that approach has been taken the

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,980
conversations are far more helpful and

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,050
the final conclusions are exactly what

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,520
you know exactly what the project needs

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,750
maybe not what was originally discussed

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,370
but exactly what the project really

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:35,080
needs to to solve that problem so you

00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,800
need to listen to that feedback you need

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,720
to consider that feedback

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,700
don't necessarily need to do everything

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,860
that feedback says you know we are a

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,500
smart bunch of people that doesn't

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,720
necessarily mean we're always right and

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,310
yeah if you listen to all of that

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,780
feedback and you're still sure that your

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,880
way of doing things is how you want to

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,560
do it well then good luck to you go

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,070
ahead you know we'll see how it works

00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,810
when it's in the distributions but if

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,810
you do decide at this point that okay I

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,580
was wrong you know it's not a failure to

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,250
just admit at that point and you know

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,960
stop what you're doing in fact yeah

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,310
there's enough threads on Factory that

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,900
if people go back and think about that

00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,400
in the context of this you can see

00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,770
plenty of examples where I've suggested

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,600
stuff one factory and then it never

00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,940
happened because people were right when

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:25,010
they said I was wrong it's a learning

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:27,110
experience and that's a good thing but

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,670
if you are getting that feedback the

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,080
fast feedback really helps you know

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,970
don't just post on the mailing list

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,630
fire-and-forget and ignore all the

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,640
replies do respond do engage because

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,200
that those discussions are how you find

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,060
volunteers to help you with that

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,850
there's been plenty of times in openSUSE

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,980
where I've proposed an idea people have

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,210
argued about it that I was crazy said I

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,830
was nuts and then I ended up with the

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,410
team of five people half of them who

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,000
thought I was nuts working on the thing

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,370
with me because they wanted to make sure

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,900
it was right so that's how you really

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:02,900
that's how these self organize teams

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:06,470
start more often than not decide what

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,250
you want to do and do it it's really

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,890
that simple

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,660
and sometimes from these discussions and

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,390
this way when you do end up with

00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,640
multiple solutions to a problem and

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,440
that's not necessarily a bad thing yeah

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,940
if you look at openSUSE you know how

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,950
many desktop environments do we have

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,360
this is how we ended up with that you

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,030
know there's more than one way to skin a

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,860
cat why not do all of them if you have

00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,860
people behind it pushing for it

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,820
and so that's it do it the all set get

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,830
started get cracking do whatever you

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,960
want to do an open Caesar it's an open

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:48,060
project opens in the name the clues

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,590
there and normally at this point I end

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,440
up with people asking me well yeah but

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,350
what about those corporate guys you know

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,210
what about Susan you know aren't they

00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,020
controlling what you guys are doing you

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,800
know aren't they

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,780
deciding what needs to be done and ok

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,340
this is like I know that talk about this

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,720
kind of today cuz I didn't realize

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,090
everybody else was talking on this topic

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,430
but yeah you know openSUSE is truly an

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,290
independent open-source project yes it's

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,640
sponsored by Souza Souza are backing us

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,060
who'sa are paying for a lot of this this

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,090
weekend but not the only sponsor we have

00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,530
others like IP exchange v1 systems who

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:31,380
are here as well and applied micro but

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,180
Souza believes in open source the same

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,530
way openSUSE believes an open source

00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,630
you know Souza's contributions to

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,630
openSUSE are done as peers not as

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,010
controllers in any way and you know

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,960
engineers have encouraged to spend less

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,190
free time in here I mean you know this

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,100
is a raise of hands how many Souza

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:53,570
engineers are in the room yeah see yeah

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,570
so you know you all know how it works

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,590
yeah so there are plenty of examples

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,690
like we hear bleep 15 launch day you

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:07,110
know bleep 15 is based on Slee you know

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,850
it's a wonderful example of how the two

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,300
different communities in essence work

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,080
together work on the same codebase

00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,630
tumbleweed is the base for silly

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,270
engineering but all of that close

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,830
working together doesn't mean that the

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,110
Souza's that open scissors direction is

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,790
controlled by Sousa there are an equal

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,220
number of examples where openSUSE

00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,300
diverges from Sousa

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,920
you know for example actually I'm

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,480
skipping ahead of a slide again what my

00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,140
slight bit to a completely messed up

00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,900
sorry yeah we will use the same tools

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:42,210
and in fact like you heard this morning

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,570
in the keynote you know a lot of the

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,460
things like CIA

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,200
kukuri like a lot of reproducible

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,050
building that you see in open suit in

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,610
susan l all started in openSUSE so it's

00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:54,670
not just the case of code contributions

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,700
flowing it's also a case of philosophy

00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,610
and engineering processes and and design

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,410
which transfers from openSUSE to suzhou

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,820
when Sousa realized that's the better

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:06,430
way of building this stuff that's the

00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:08,470
better way of testing this stuff so it

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,240
really is a two-way street you know

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,770
openSUSE gets our wonderful code base

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,800
for leap as soon as he gets their

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,980
wonderful code base for firstly we share

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,870
everything in between but it doesn't

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,090
mean we do everything exactly the same

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,730
way like I said an equal number of

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,140
places where openSUSE diverges away this

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,790
list is getting longer and longer in

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,410
fact but you know the obvious ones you

00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,290
know the default desktop in openSUSE is

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,480
KDE slee doesn't even have KDE anymore

00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,730
you know if we have a completely

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,840
different style of the distribution when

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,620
it comes to the product you know it's

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,120
less is lean modular everything's these

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,590
different components the customers can

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,890
pick and choose depending on how they

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:51,100
want and we distribute leap as one large

00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,690
distribution in one large repo because

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,640
that's the way we think is best to do it

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,710
and we have a completely different

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,910
installation workflow in fact we have a

00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,940
completely different installation

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,680
workflow in like every different yeah

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,280
every different product that we have in

00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,650
openSUSE like caspin cubic and the like

00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,630
and to kind of yeah give the more visual

00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,250
example of how that'll work that's why

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,430
she we say cuz he works on the a steam

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,580
so you know the a steam are perhaps the

00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:20,080
the most souza controlled part of

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,760
openSUSE in the sense of they're almost

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,800
all the developers are entirely employed

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,290
by Sousa and they're working on Sousa

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,440
products but even there's you you know

00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:32,290
explain it's entirely open and yeah how

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,690
it'll work so over to you now thank you

00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:49,200
sir thank you Richard so let me talk

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:53,370
about how we develop just so

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,809
to fall what what is he asked yes stands

00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,539
for yet another setup tool I joined the

00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:03,240
company more than 16 years ago and when

00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,340
I joined the company the installation

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,309
and configuration tool off at that point

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:13,049
of time SUSE Linux was called he just so

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:17,460
nothing changed it was completely home

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:19,860
brung home developed solution project

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:26,730
started in Susa from scratch developed

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:28,830
by a team team which was completely part

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:32,730
of Souza here in Prague and in Nuremberg

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,809
and to some extent this is how it is

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,649
until today

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:40,740
of course Baghdad all the development

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:44,010
was in-house we wrote it in a

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,289
proprietary programming language even

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,529
though we got the source code not all

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:53,269
parts were under a free license all the

00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:55,769
communication was inside the company

00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:58,740
which is something that has changed

00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:02,330
nowadays all the communication channels

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:07,169
are public hosted by openSUSE freenode

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:15,090
the repository is public so we do our

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:21,330
work way more in open even though the

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:23,760
team is inside Suzy use it allows you to

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,590
contribute there are really many options

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,389
I put just three of them here on the

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:30,539
slides

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:32,820
yes consists of modules which are more

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:38,750
or less independent so if you are brave

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:42,570
enough you can write your own new module

00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:45,690
does anybody have any idea of module

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:48,929
which was written by community community

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:54,330
member who was not nothing never

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:55,540
employee of Sudha there was one called

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,840
one-click installer

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,639
[Music]

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:04,259
the yeah it was it was developed by

00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:08,039
Benji Weber and there is one more

00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:10,320
example which was the GDK beckoned for

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,049
the user interface it was also also

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,820
written by somebody out of Sousa at

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:18,389
least out of the esteem here I do not

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,330
know whom exactly while writing your own

00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:26,190
module might be a bit too much for the

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:29,100
beginning so you may start fixing your

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:32,129
own fixing your favorite bug which

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,779
bothers you most or maybe you are liking

00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:39,509
some functionality so this is what you

00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:43,620
can do so how do you provide your code

00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:46,110
as Richard mentioned all the code lives

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,870
in the open built service here on the

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,210
slide I put a link to the development

00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:58,049
project where aureus packages which go

00:28:51,210 --> 00:29:01,980
to openSUSE factorials are hosted so if

00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:04,980
you so this this is where any package

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,289
will end up of course this is for

00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,889
openSUSE factory if you want to provide

00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:17,600
a package for any older release they

00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:21,389
have their own sub project anyway yeah

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,460
most of the teams do not work only on

00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:27,960
build service because it has no conflict

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:33,059
resolution and that they do team benefit

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:36,200
of version control systems like well 16

00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:42,120
years ago it was CVS forest and then

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:47,580
subversion nowadays it is gate and just

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:52,980
lives in the github repository so how to

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:56,340
contribute properly here I put on a

00:29:52,980 --> 00:30:00,570
slide linked to the yes yes project on

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:06,240
github which hosts all just repositories

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:07,620
so the easiest way and I have I can see

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,220
at least two members of the esteem here

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,000
in the room they can confirm that this

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,160
is the way we appreciate most is find

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,740
the repository where you want to add new

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:24,330
staff for the repository work on your

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,210
fork and when you think that you are

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:30,900
ready to be merged to our code then

00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,420
create a pull request the reason for per

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,850
request is not something like we do not

00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,850
trust you to give you access to the

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,970
repository directly this is how we work

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,830
on our own as well it has a various

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,800
advantages one of the rules we have in

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,440
the team is that all code before it gets

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,890
merged should be reviewed by at least

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,170
one other developer and the boricua

00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,470
scheme which is provided by git git hub

00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,920
it serves this purpose

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:04,920
Morris perfectly

00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:07,770
anybody who can comment on your changes

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,410
give you feedback you can discuss it in

00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,690
github then later if the one who gave

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:16,590
you the initial feedback was on vacation

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:19,830
anybody else can step in has all the

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,140
history so it's a nice platform for the

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:27,210
communication based communication for

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:29,970
the code changes and we also have

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:34,100
various tools hooked into the pull

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:36,840
request which which means for example

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,250
you can see before you merge your

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,390
changes whether the package will build

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:44,790
after after your changes merged you can

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:47,130
see that you cut the test coverage of

00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,890
the package into half if you did more

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:56,420
changes so all these checks can be done

00:31:49,890 --> 00:32:00,110
before your court code is merged and it

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:03,260
prevents submitting package which is

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:07,530
anyhow wrong

00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:09,390
so after the discussion about your coat

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:12,090
and if it's your first submission

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,320
probably there will be some you get the

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,990
package merged into the git repository

00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:21,300
and as long as we are working on a

00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:23,040
factory or the automation behind will

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,490
take care that the package appears in

00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:34,160
the develop project and later the submit

00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:37,380
request to factory is created of course

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,270
or maybe not of course but you might

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,620
need some help

00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:47,030
when you implement your change the best

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:52,650
way to get help of course is to ask

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:55,080
their steamer communicates almost

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,650
exclusively on public mailing lists on

00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:06,270
or in public IRC channel here you have

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:07,710
the links on on in the slide so whatever

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,910
is more convenient for you whatever you

00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:15,420
prefer either send us a mail or connect

00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:18,179
to the IRC channel and ask just keep in

00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,820
mind one thing especially if you live on

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:24,600
the other at the end of the planet the

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:27,350
team is located only in two thousand

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,010
times out timezones next to each other

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:40,679
so Australia naneun is not the best time

00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:45,690
to ask on IRC so you created a pull

00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:47,730
request and nothing happened well of

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:53,160
course it doesn't put us into the best

00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:54,660
light but it it can happen it happens

00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,050
for poor request of the US team members

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,710
too

00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:04,380
so the only thing you can do and you

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:07,620
should do is contact us and remind us

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,649
about your changes and if you do it in

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,540
the right time then I'm pretty sure that

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:14,340
somebody from the team will give you the

00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,480
feedback which you are you are searching

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,070
for

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,900
important but I think that's true for

00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,690
all open-source project do not take any

00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,480
feedback you might get personally not

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,090
nobody nobody from the team is native

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:34,190
English speaker we come from different

00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:37,730
environments so whatever if something

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,740
sounds ok for somebody somebody else may

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,929
take it personally

00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:46,159
we never mean it what we want to do is

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:48,900
to find a way to get your changes to a

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,130
state in which they can be merged and

00:34:48,900 --> 00:35:02,810
[Music]

00:34:51,130 --> 00:35:07,360
really get them to the project so if you

00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:10,540
want to help with just and are you

00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,860
searching for what could I do

00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,360
yes there is definitely a lot of work

00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:18,940
which you could do if you do not have

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,890
your favorite bug which bothers you or

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:27,800
you don't feel that you want you are

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:31,850
able to fix it we the esteem has so many

00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,950
bugs that to be on to be honest to

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,930
ourselves they cannot they cannot be

00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,930
fixed in a reasonable time by the team

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:44,990
itself that's why we try to identify

00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:47,210
bugs which in our view seem to be easy

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:51,530
enough so that anybody who does not have

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:53,630
that much experience can fix them and we

00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:57,410
put them on on a specific assignee in

00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:01,790
Bugzilla so if you would like to get

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:04,840
inspiration what to start with this is a

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:11,200
recommendation where you find bugs which

00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:11,200
we believe that you will be able to fix

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:22,980
so want to learn more I put on the slide

00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,539
two links to the yes documentation they

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,559
should give you they should give you

00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:32,670
hints what to start what to learn how to

00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:36,859
start anyway have you ever seen a

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:42,839
documentation which is perfect yeah

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:43,740
nobody did and if you look into it find

00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,980
something missing

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,160
again please tell us if you do not tell

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,140
us what is missing in the documentation

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,270
you can be sure that we will not fix it

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:58,529
because for us it seems obvious and

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:03,630
until somebody who is not familiar with

00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:17,849
the topic reviews it it will remain in

00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:21,150
our view this way yeah so just in

00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,819
closing you know you decide whatever

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,460
happens you know yeah there's nobody

00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:28,859
else yeah it's up to you entirely what

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,059
the project looks like not a single part

00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:33,270

00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:35,130

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,140
