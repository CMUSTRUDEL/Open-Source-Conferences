Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - openSUSE is what you make it
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	How to change anything you want in the project

This talk is for openSUSE's aspiring new contributors, existing contributors, users, detractors, or just anyone curious at all about openSUSE. In other words, if you're at this conference, you should consider being at this talk ;)

The session will detail how openSUSE does what it does, and most importantly how openSUSE strives to empower ANYONE to be able to contribute to the project.

The presentation will outline examples of not only basic contributions to the distributions (Leap & Tumbleweed), but also explain through example and anecdote how anyone can influence, steer, and drive the direction of the openSUSE Project, including changing the scope of the Project by introducing new sub projects.

The session will end with a Q&A section for anyone to ask any question about contributing to the project in general, to provide feedback on any potential improvements to openSUSE's current contribution story, or to ask those first questions about that first contribution so that YOU can start making openSUSE YOURS.
