Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - Fleet Commander: The efficient way of managing the Desktop profiles of yo
Publication date: 2018-05-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/1663-fleet-commander-the-efficient-way-of-managing-the-desktop-profiles-of-your-fleet

A brief description of the project and its internals!

This talk will go through what Fleet Commander is (and, consequently, what Fleet Commander is not intended for), which are the solutions proposed by the project, how Fleet Commander interacts with SSSD and freeIPA and, plans for the future and finally provide a Demo of the current state of the project.

The talk will be divided basically in 4 parts:

1) Describing what Fleet Commander is (and what it's not intended for): Fleet Commander is an integrated solution for large Linux desktop deployments that provides a configuration management interface that is controlled centrally and that covers desktop, applications and network configuration. Last but not least, Neither Ansible nor Puppet could solve the core problems of Desktop Session Configuration Management, which is what drove the Fleet Commander development.

2) Describing Fleet Commander interaction with freeIPA and SSSD: Fleet Commander relies on freeIPA, which provides a standalone plugin for desktop profile management, to store the profile data and its assignments to users, groups and hosts from the administrator point-of-view. From the client point-of-view, Fleet Commander relies on SSSD to fetch the the profile data at users' login time and notify Fleet Commander whenever new profiles have to be applied.

3) A short Demo about the current status of the project: This will be the first time that Fleet Commander project will be Demo'ed after the freeIPA/SSSD integration.

4) Plans for the future: A quick discussion about what are the plans for the future, including a way to manage profile data in case of direct integration between Linux clients and Active Directory servers!

	00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,059
so I infer beneficial I am a software

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,619
engineer working for head hair red hat

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,080
for the last five years and something

00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:21,630
I'm here to talk about fit commander and

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,720
try to show you guys why Fleet Commander

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,520
is the most efficient way to manage

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:33,120
desktop profiles of your fleet

00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:35,399
I have to say that this talk although I

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,050
am the one presenting here it was made

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,750
in collaboration with Oliver Gutierrez

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,200
who is the main fleet commander

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,290
developer and also I would like to

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,180
mention that you can see a bunch of

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,860
logos up there is because food commander

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,579
interact with a lot of projects cockpit

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,980
voice free IPA and drip OSD which is the

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,980
project that I am currently working on I

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:15,539
guess the first thing to say is in

00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:17,159
saying that food commander is the

00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:19,560
efficient way to manage desktop profiles

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,179
of our fleet but what the hell is a

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,509
desktop profile so a desktop profile is

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:32,549
basically a bunch of desktop related

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,959
settings associated associated to a user

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,959
group host or hostess

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:48,299
at this point this is taya tube norm let

00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:52,139
me tell you a little bit about fit

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:58,229
commander and the idea behind this

00:01:52,139 --> 00:02:01,950
project this project was created because

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,520
managing desktop profiles is not that

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,550
easy Zack Larry of pain forces it means

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:14,760
if you are asking why you're most likely

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:17,970
are not as easily mean basically when we

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,830
are dealing with those that stop

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,020
profiles one thing that we don't want to

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:27,600
do is we don't want to mess up with

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,740
users home directory and so far there is

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,000
no solution that does that messing up

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,400
with the users home directory is

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,510
something really not good because user

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,970
can override it and then your script can

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,590
just try to overwrite it again and you

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,450
may end up in a state that is not

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,500
exactly consistent the second thing is

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,990
that deploying those changes is not

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,730
something easy to do mainly when you are

00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:01,430
talking about a company that has ten

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,960
thousand users with a bunch of groups

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,820
that should apply to different hosts or

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,750
different host groups so this is

00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:12,600
something not easy to manage mainly

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:21,209
because we don't have a specialized tool

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:24,750
to do that you know we are the tool we

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:30,150
are here to provide you guys easy

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:33,360
insinuate to do this job before I go

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,800
ahead like let me just try to have

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,660
everyone on the same page about what

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,120
foot commander is not we are not a

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,340
system-wide management configuration

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:53,070
tool we are here for desktop profiles we

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:58,590
care about desktop settings we are not I

00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:01,680
scripted visit solution we are a solid

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,680
tool that was developed together with

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,610
the gnome developers which helped us a

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,050
lot we pretty much know what we are

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:15,569
doing and we are trying to do it in the

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:19,500
best possible way and last but not least

00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:23,490
we are not identity and policy

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,490
management solution we rely on one we

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,050
rely on free APA for doing that but we

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:34,740
don't do that okay

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:38,010
so let me give you a brief overview

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,830
about the project because v commander is

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,550
a software that is has pretty much like

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:48,979
three components the first one is fleet

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:53,250
commander admin this is a cockpit plugin

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:56,970
so anything we end up accessing this via

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,770
web browser and this is used to manage

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:04,169
the desktop profiles with module there

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:08,550
you can create delete change we have the

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:13,919
second part there is a fleet commander

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:18,479
logger this part runs just when a live

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,889
session is running I'm not going to tell

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,150
you guys what a live session is just

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,430
keep this name in mind and we'll show

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:28,020
you later and hopefully it is going to

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,690
work but as the name says it's pretty

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,410
much used for login the change is done

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,430
in this live session and then we have

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:41,460
the client part the client part is

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:46,889
responsible for also the user logs in

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:49,680
and and match and assistant match that

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:52,110
this is the right user or this user is

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,479
part of the right group or he's using

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,180
the right whole stored users as part of

00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,800
the right host group this specific

00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,800
profile should be applied

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,600
okay and you are talking about profiles

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:17,160
and settings but what are the settings

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,160
that we are actually supporting here

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:23,370
first thing I have to tell you there are

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:27,460
two ways to configure those settings

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:32,289
first ones via web interface where we

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,850
can configure the NAM software editor

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,009
speed this is like a software that is

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,470
going you can just recommend software's

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:43,990
that your the users of your company can

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:47,349
just install we also have support to

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,560
setting up an online accounts there are

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:53,199
still there is still some work to be

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,770
done there because we cannot do this

00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:01,120
like in a mass production but work is

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,940
being done on this front and then we

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,610
have the live section the live session

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:13,750
is basically we put up a virtual machine

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,990
with a vanilla west vanilla system that

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:20,470
you just go there do the changes you

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:23,919
want those changes are logged stored and

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:28,289
you distribute those changes to all the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,900
users and via live sessions we can have

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:35,169
the settings baited applications we can

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:39,820
have changes for Libra off c network

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:43,180
manager and chrome and firefox policies

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:47,229
I know that on fit commander side they

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:50,650
are working on a support for adding

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,060
bookmarks and setting the the first page

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:58,509
and this kind of stuff apart from the

00:07:52,060 --> 00:08:00,479
policies as well okay I will try to show

00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:03,759
you guys

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,460
how it works and how it's supposed to

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:19,779
work so let's have some demo time and

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:35,319
let's hope is that why to explode so let

00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:37,919
me move this up there nope okay this one

00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,919
here

00:08:39,180 --> 00:09:27,089
no let me just write a mirror on my

00:08:46,930 --> 00:09:27,089
screen right now over there okay nope

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:44,970
okay here we have the I don't see let me

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,970
just so here we have the free APA

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:55,720
administration in white and we are going

00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:57,160
to just add a new user or try to you

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,610
guys will have to trust me because I

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,089
couldn't need all these so everything

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,089
can go wrong so

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:33,810
actually let me try again to the mirror

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:36,870
my display okay okay better No so this

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:45,680
is the different way what you like so I

00:10:36,870 --> 00:11:00,170
just going to add a new user here OSC

00:10:45,680 --> 00:11:11,700
open SUSE user set in a password ok

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:15,360
users added and now let me just see

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:19,260
whether I can actually clean it with

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:45,260
this user okay I have to change the

00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:45,260
password that's amazing

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,190
[Music]

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:12,730
oops wrong user okay okay the user is

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:19,980
created you you saw like a log 18 let me

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,980
login in my virtual machine not this one

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:37,510
so new user we are starting the first

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:43,870
time session and you can see everything

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:54,220
here is the default on Santos next next

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:57,040
next grant skip okay so let me show let

00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:05,590
me now show you guys the the fleet

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:10,630
commander in action this is the cockpit

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:14,770
web UI I'm logged in as admin my free

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:22,810
APA administrator and I'm going set up

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:25,450
to add a new profile for the OSC and you

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,700
can set like for which users groups host

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,520
our host is going to be apply it which

00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:33,940
is the priority of this profile and what

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,230
not here I'm going to start a live

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:42,190
session so just click on edit live

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,960
session and I'm going to get this

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:49,090
vanilla machine that I have here I

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,339
connect into this machine via at your

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:55,560
fire 18:05 client

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:58,740
and this machine is pretty much like a

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,480
fresh installed machine where I'm going

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,920
to do the changes there and foot

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:12,140
commander logger is going to log those

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,140
changes on I'm done with then I will

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,560
reveal them apply them and then log out

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,630
and login if that user that I have

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,339
created to show you guys that those

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,070
changes actually change I guess one of

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,250
the most easiest changes to do that you

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:39,990
guys can see is like changing the

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:55,560
background so do you guys want to choose

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:58,950
one the pink one okay the pink one then

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,440
we review in submit here are the changes

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:11,010
that were done where we want to get the

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:17,190
background one save it and it's done

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:21,180
let's see now if it works here is the

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:35,449
machine they are in locating I an the

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:38,839
openSUSE user I'm going to log out and

00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,839
log in again

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,620
and it failed

00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:00,000
okay amazing live demos they are just

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,000
amazing

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,830
let me just show the buggy a little bit

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:50,190
and let's try again the client was down

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,190
let's see if it's

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,130
nope okay so I'll have to skip this part

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,920
of lively I know you guys are going to

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:11,490
trust me or who have to trust me that's

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,350
going to work I'm sorry we can get sit

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,760
together after this meeting and do some

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,560
debug on this together I should have

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,740
prepared the video I tried is like a few

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,730
minutes before it was kind of work so

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,730
what was supposed to happen

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,910
basically on on the first part like on

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:38,820
the cockpit webui you have the fleet

00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:41,760
commander plug-in there you can add a

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,370
new profile and manage it and then you

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,150
just what I did I click it on live

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,150
session we just spawned virtual machine

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:55,020
on this virtual machine we did all the

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,600
changes we wanted all those changes were

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,910
logged by foot commander logger and sent

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,220
back to the admin machine through spice

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:09,540
for spice channel also we review this

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:13,800
and save it it is stored on free APA

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:17,580
there is a plugin for that called creepy

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:22,670
desktop profile and also I login into

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:25,400
the client machine it should download

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:32,430
factor those profiles and apply them

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:34,500
unfortunately something exploded here if

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,300
you guys want to give it a try and I

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,270
hope that after this talk you still want

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,940
to give you that right everything will

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:46,110
be available is available on fedora 26

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:51,810
or newer and everything should be

00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:55,920
available on CentOS 7 5 or newer I have

00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:59,550
are not using it here but I have fit

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,700
commander vagrant ansible project that

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,680
just gives you a bunch actually two

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,160
virtual machines with everything ready

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,380
to use the reason we are not using these

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,270
here is because I've been trying these

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,360
on CentOS and I don't have support to

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,090
Santos yet

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,980
support for fedoras but I'm going to

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:23,200
edit and fix those issues here's the

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:28,179
github page this slide is going to be

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,799
somewhere we have some oops some plans

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:33,640
for future releases that's pretty much

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:37,510
like UI and UX enhancements make it work

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,640
for sure and we would like to have a way

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,970
to support direct integration with

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:47,110
effective directory because right now we

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:49,570
support it with free APA but a bunch of

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,740
people just use direct integration with

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:59,230
fede but this is a GPO domain that are

00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:01,390
not that familiar with if someone here

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,570
is familiar with GPO let's talk after

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:07,179
this meeting after this talk and you

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,840
guys can give me some help talking about

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:12,870
help we really need your help we need

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,230
your help

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:21,580
coding there are bugs I guess you guys

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:24,880
saw there are bugs so we need some help

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,919
to fix them but here is the part that I

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,450
would like to get the attention of you

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:35,460
because we are missing a bunch of

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:38,169
packages on open source we don't have

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,559
cockpit for up and sauce the last time I

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:44,140
checked at least we don't have cockpit

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,460
we don't have any free IP a package for

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,980
openSUSE we use it to have at some point

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:55,630
Derek's not sure if directories here

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,100
Derek's was maintaining free APA but at

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,669
least the client-side but it's not

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,530
Monday anymore and I not sure right like

00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:07,200
if there is something that you guys need

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:10,840
from us from free APA come talk to us

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,820
open interest we are really really

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,350
willing to fix those issues in order to

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,350
provide you guys those packages as well

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:24,720
and we don't have any food commander

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,299
cold for openSUSE as well but in order

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,330
to have it there we need for Scott Pete

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:32,100
and and free APA so if someone is

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,830
willing to give it a try if someone is

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:40,919
willing to give us some help to do that

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:42,389
let's stop and we need your help with a

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,080
handsome any requests if you start use

00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:49,950
using it and if you see something going

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,039
not quite well as this pink me pink

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:58,769
enough developers we are going to fix

00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:00,859
the issue I would like to say thanks to

00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:06,119
a few people here like the free APA part

00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:09,019
who drove this project is basically

00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:12,269
Alexander bakirkoy and Christian Haines

00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:15,869
myself and Rosa we did the whole part

00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:18,269
for s SSD and a special thanks to a

00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:20,700
former colleague Pavel ground from spice

00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:25,230
team because they did the whole spice

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:28,409
work here is just like a bunch of more

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,149
informations about the project dislike

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:34,200
this will be uploaded after the talk so

00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:36,509
you guys can just find it and are you

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,009
open for questions don't ask why I

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:40,009
didn't work I would have to debug it

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:53,850
go ahead no no no it's not dependent on

00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,499
user so the question was he said that

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,330
probably it didn't work because I use it

00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,279
the wrong user it's not dependent on the

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:02,279
user the user knew you're logging in the

00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,080
live session the live session is just

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,980
like a way to get all the changes you do

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,320
there so it doesn't matter we just get

00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,159
all those changes will compile a deacon

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,100
file and we install this Deacon fro file

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,539
on the client machine and in the

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,519
beginning I said that we are not messing

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,739
up with home users home directory and

00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,100
that's the reason why because we have

00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:27,280
the season

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,990
/ compiled layer of settings we have a

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,490
defeater commander one and then the user

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:36,480
the user can do whatever they want in

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:48,010
the end another question

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:51,010
go ahead so the settings are applied

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,900
when you log in if there are no changes

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:56,110
in the profile we have downloaded we are

00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,750
not going to do anything but if there is

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,110
some changes we are just going to fetch

00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,880
a new profile and applied it

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,890
automatically keep in mind that if the

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,080
user changed something we are talking

00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,059
about layers again we have the system v

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,470
commander and the user if the user

00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:14,350
changes something we are not going to

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:16,679
override it but you can easily change

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:20,679
all the configurations of your company

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,169
deploy it easily and without likely

00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,110
having to worry about that just user

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:40,929
logging again and quite it should be

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:46,510
quite easy go ahead we have some people

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:48,760
trying it out we still don't have any

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,039
specific user that I can tell you that

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,299
this company is using this this is a new

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,850
project this is a so we have to get it

00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:59,590
in a little bit more mature State and

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,840
that's what we are doing we are talking

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,059
to some companies in order to have it in

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,770
the material state that then hopefully

00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:08,289
next year I can get back here saying

00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:13,980
those companies are using these they are

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:13,980
happy and my demo is going to work maybe

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:21,570
any more questions go ahead

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:33,500
[Music]

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,300
so the question was that this is

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:43,840
designed specifically for Nam and what

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:46,960
about supporting our applications it may

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,790
be done in the future for now we are

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,910
relying on these headings this is the

00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,500
easiest way to load if there is some

00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,930
easy way to log for other environments

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,480
maybe but for now we are trying to focus

00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,010
on unknown because we have control of

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,830
these we have the developers working

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:12,430
together with us and trying to make it

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:15,690
work there something else so let's call

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,950
that theta talk thanks everyone

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:20,260
please if you want to see it working

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,640
approach me like in the quarter I'm

00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,550
going to make it work before I leave

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,050
this conference and last but not least I

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:32,830
not here only to talk about this I would

00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:34,870
like to give you guys another short demo

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,610
about something that was quite nice I'm

00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,670
not going to take much time from Carlos

00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:46,960
conference Carlos talk it's going to be

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:48,670
just something so I am also a Libra

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,680
synth maintainer Libra seen with the

00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:56,800
project that helps noms non boxes to do

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:59,230
Express installation for systems in

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,260
general we have a cool system being

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,470
released at yesterday right

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,950
and I crafted some patches while coming

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,990
from Renault to here and let's see if

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,990
they work maybe they don't as well

00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:46,540
so non boxes this is the yesterday

00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:51,040
release it open so slip and here is the

00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:53,760
Express distillation this is done using

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:59,830
out last August developers are there

00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:04,630
thanks for the support and continue

00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:07,720
create I would just leave my laptop here

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,820
Carlos will come give his talk if it has

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,620
two or three minutes after that will

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,880
call me back I will show you guys that

00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:19,170
everything is just all no hands and

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,170
that's all things over our time

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,500
