How to update your systems without breaking them

With the release of Leap 15 the new system role called "Transactional Server" will be available during the installation, so this is the perfect opportunity to have a look at the concept behind it and how to work with such a system in practice.

In this talk we will have a look at transactional-updates from different angles:
* The basic concepts behind transactional-update
* How to use the Transactional Server or Kubic (Users & Administrators)
* Packaging for transactional systems (Packagers)
* How transactional-update compares to other solutions from various distributions (Developers)
* Recent developments in the transactional-update world
