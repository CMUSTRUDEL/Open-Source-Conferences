Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - Create a complete Tor .onion site with Docker and OpenSUSE in less than 1
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	Doing something cool with minimum time.

In a way, both Docker and Tor are shrouded in mystery. Containers have been the biggest thing in the IT field in the past few years and yet a lot of people don't know what they are good for. Why not just use a VM? Likewise, Tor is known only for the negative uses and connotations such as "The Dark Web" and "The Deep Web" meanwhile not many people know about the actual positives of the technology when it comes to secure communication and privacy.

My presentation would be a short primer on both of these technologies followed by a 15-minute demonstration on how to create a Wordpress website, MariaDB Database, and Tor entry point with Docker on OpenSUSE Leap 15 that can be recreated on any hardware or VM even without an external IP and accessed anywhere in the world using the Tor Browser. There should also be time to take Q&A at the end.

My docker-compose files, notes, and presentation will then be available on GitHub.

all right we're gonna create a complete

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,780
tour onion service with docker and

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,620
openSUSE in less than 15 minutes

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,150
unfortunately my presentation is a

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,060
little longer than 15 minutes but not

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,210
much more and I promise to keep my slide

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,390
deck short but first of all what is tor

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,010
tor is a free software and an open to

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,990
network that helps you defend against

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,849
traffic analysis which is a form of

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,520
network surveillance that threatens

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,540
personal freedom and privacy

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,200
confidential business activities and

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,559
relationships and stage security how

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,739
does tor work tor works basically like

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,600
this so Alice's Tor network obtains a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,370
list of tor nodes from the server

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,969
directory her client which is normally

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,820
the tor browser picks up a random path

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,530
to the destination server green links

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,379
are encrypted red links are in the clear

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,879
so anything inside of the Tor network is

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,640
encrypted doesn't matter if they're

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,979
using HTTP HTTP doesn't matter the

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,820
protocol it's encrypted but once you

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:14,930
leave they took the the Tor network then

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,680
it's not Dennis then it's normal traffic

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:22,890
if at any time the user Act visits in a

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,229
visit to another site Torv alice's tor

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,810
client selects a second secondary random

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,079
path again the green links are encrypted

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,630
the red links are not

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,020
what isn't tor and now if you read

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,479
anything about InfoSec or about the

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,170
security community you're gonna hear

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:48,530
that tor is a bad place what isn't

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,530
tor tor isn't the dark web

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:55,890
tor is a security and privacy network it

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,850
is used by normal people journalists

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,740
activists bloggers law enforcement

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,630
business executives militaries and IT

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,070
professionals I'm not going to go into

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,380
these long spiel about each one of these

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,179
but I did leave a link here so you can

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,220
actually see more about how different

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,100
groups of people are using tor

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,720
but it has problems it's got bad

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,000
neighbors

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,800
there are lots and lots of bad websites

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
on the Tor network we know what those

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,860
are those are drug markets those are

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,530
crime markets those are really bad there

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,470
are really bad things and because of

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,920
this has got a bad reputation I would

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,520
not do this presentation at Sousa Khan

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,210
because in a corporate environment

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,830
people aren't going to want to hear

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,430
about pork because it's because it

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:47,570
sounds bad it's got a bad reputation

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,790
it's it's edgy it's also a little slow

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,920
because of the encryption factor within

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,830
tour where everything is encrypted at

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,500
least three times for every uh to get

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,709
from you to the outside Internet via

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,490
poor you're gonna have lag and there's

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,230
no way around that but we can help

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,540
change the face of Tor network we can

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,300
encourage encourage security and privacy

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,340
advocates and users to harness the power

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,110
of the network we can encourage

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,080
nonprofits to mirror their websites and

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,310
port we need good neighbors and of

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,980
course you can build your own onion

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,350
service if you've got a blog are you

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,600
thinking about doing a blog maybe put it

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,610
on tour or maybe merit on tour if you've

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,989
got a non-profit especially a nonprofit

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,870
that deals with information such as

00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,150
whistleblowers mirror your information

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,209
your mirror your website on tour that

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,390
makes sure that you're both you and your

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,900
users get that extra level of security

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:52,040
and privacy

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,799
how do container straighten all this and

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,230
how our onion service is made well the

00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,360
old way and this is not using containers

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,150
bob was to build an onion service this

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,100
is what we call the tour website he's

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,799
not a website already but wants to be

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,320
available on tour this is to protect the

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,680
privacy of his users he installs a tour

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,470
service

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,040
zipper and tour course he's a good Linux

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,470
user and uses openSUSE he and it says

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,349
Etsy tour RC file it tells it to listen

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,610
on port 80 he starts the service he gets

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,919
a new two onion

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,960
a host name and anybody can go to that

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,120
website via the tor browser the new way

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Kiko wants to build an onion service but

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,090
he's very protective of his privacy he

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,900
he's got different ideas and information

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,240
that he would like to share with the

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,439
world but he doesn't necessarily want

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,099
people to know who he is

00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,710
for whatever reason he creates a web

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,939
container and attaches it to the Tor

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,110
container which is what we're gonna do

00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:58,169
today he never opens pore 84 43 or any

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,969
other port locally so if you do an end

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:02,779
map on his server you're not gonna see

00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:05,849
those ports ports open they are not open

00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:08,490
apache thinks it's open and patchy will

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,479
bring in traffic on those ports but

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,680
they're not really open

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:16,710
tor that the Tor client or the pore

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,900
server port service will actually bring

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,180
in that traffic and make apache think

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:28,229
it's coming in on it on port 80 but it's

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:31,050
not really he could find if again he

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:34,139
finds his new onion hostname and VAR lib

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,339
poor hostname on the container we're

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,229
actually going to use a little script to

00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:41,699
do that for us but it's going to be

00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:43,379
there accessing onion services Alice

00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,659
hears about Bob and geek O's websites

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,639
she installs the tor browser again she's

00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,409
a good open SUSE user zipper and tor

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,139
browser launcher anybody with a laptop

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,120
here who is not that's not have tor

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,199
already installed go ahead and do that

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,529
because we're going to be doing some

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,539
live exercises it's not the fastest

00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,509
thing to download but it's out there and

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:06,029
of course it's free she never she puts

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:09,539
in the onion URL like any other neither

00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:10,889
Bob nor gecko ever see who she is or any

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,500
other information that she doesn't want

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,599
to give a matter of fact if their

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,189
website let's say is just serving plain

00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:22,949
HTML files no scripts no JavaScript

00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:24,659
nothing else just plain HTML there's

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,830
nothing that he can see about her and

00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,830
there's nothing so you can see about him

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:34,430
she doesn't know who Yuko is because he

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,600
doesn't explicitly say and there's no

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,690
easy way to find out

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,310
because Kiko is not an idiot Kiko

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,480
doesn't it doesn't go around on on

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:48,380
reddit saying hey I've got this website

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,280
he just has it out there anonymously so

00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,950
that way he can give you information

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,780
that he wants to share she appreciates

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,240
this you can also view Bob's website to

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,330
secure them securely and without fear of

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,950
being monitored what our docker

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,410
containers also we're gonna get into the

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,790
container part now a container image is

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,820
a lightweight standalone executable

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,410
package of a piece of software that

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,740
includes everything needed to run it

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:16,400
code runtime system pulls system

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,940
libraries and settings by how does this

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,060
help us it's easy to run several onion

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,530
services at once you don't have to know

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,150
how to setup the individual pieces you

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,100
don't have to be an expert in my sequel

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,250
you don't have to be an expert at Apache

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,940
or internets you focus on your content

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:37,040
and not on your administration wouldn't

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,630
a VM work also sure there's nothing

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,860
wrong with running a VM however if you

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,780
don't want to research all the running

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,370
pieces or if you're new or if you're

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,500
highly constrained for example you've

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,270
only got a VM and you don't have the

00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,830
resources to create another VM inside of

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:55,400
it which is not usually a good idea and

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:58,700
haters make more sense some of some some

00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,720
comparisons between virtual machines and

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:06,290
Kerr's isolation portability what they

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,410
contain and the speed not going to go

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,090
through all of this but the big thing to

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,650
point out is that containers run a

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,980
little faster they have some limitations

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,290
VMs require more overhead they run a

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,910
little slower but they also contain a

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,350
full operating system and not just a

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,650
piece of an operating system needed to

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,100
run an application so our demonstration

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,210
today we're gonna use three containers

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,300
the first one will be a web server

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,790
running Apache will be a web server

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,470
running Apache in WordPress the second

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,960
will be a my sequel database and the

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,520
third will be running tor

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,380
for a demonstration I'll be using docker

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,930
and docker images to create the

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,340
containers and the dr. promote docker

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,770
compose command to set up everything

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,630
quickly and easily using these steps you

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,940
can replicate this example website on

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,960
your own

00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:01,880
the Bennets dependencies will all use a

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,970
zipper and these these uh these command

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,530
these these applications if you don't

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,520
already have them already and the

00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,120
dependencies will take care of

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,030
everything else

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,350
and here's my get file and I'm going to

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:36,650
go ahead and make a smaller I'm gonna go

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:38,270
ahead and get the send myself by the way

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,000
is this big enough for everybody or is

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:48,850
running to make it bigger

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:54,440
good great so we've just done that part

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,970
make this big again let's look at this

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,360
docker compose file that we just pull

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,880
down when I first talked about even

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,780
though we the previous slide I said it

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,090
was going to be the Apache then Micra

00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,530
sequel then tour in the actual file I've

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,810
written it as tour first just because

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,970
it's easier so let's look at tour the

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,920
tour service this tour service is

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,280
running off of an image called Goldie

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,530
slashed Hortons service latest Goldie is

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,930
actually pretty good in that his images

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,990
are up-to-date and he generally keeps

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,520
the latest version of tour in his image

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:32,150
this links to the WordPress image in

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:35,720
that the WordPress image contains Apache

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,740
which is going to be listening listening

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,180
on port 80 even though it's not really

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,520
it's going to save its key it's it's

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,410
hidden service keys into a local

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:54,240
directory dot in the tour directory it's

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:57,990
pseudo looking for ports on port 80 even

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,640
though it's not really the database

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:06,209
image is running my Maria DB Oh in this

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,290
image we can predefined our variables

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:12,630
these are really crappy passwords I know

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,070
my sequel route the database name of the

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,870
database the user and the password of

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,180
the user and again we're gonna save that

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,370
configuration to a local file so if we

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,750
do crash this container we can just

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,830
bring it right back up and not lose any

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:28,410
data and then the wordpress container

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,550
we're using the standard generic

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,930
wordpress image from hub for calm we're

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,589
going to link this to the database

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,870
because the my wordpress needs the

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,630
database in order to work off of the

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,390
environment variables have to meet have

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:48,180
to match what are here so we know that

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,540
the database name user and password are

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
here

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,200
and we have the same thing here and then

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:59,220
database host by the way it knows that

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:02,100
the name of the database is DB so it's

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,660
looking for DB on for 3306 this is in

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,880
this case it actually is a real port but

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,980
it's inside of docker it's never seen on

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,630
the outside we're not going to publish

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,140
this on the outside it's just the inside

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,200
of the containers and then we just

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,649
docker compose up - tea - tea will give

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:30,540
Renison as a daemon not live as so oh

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:32,970
yes they are not I do have a lamp lamp

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,060
stack image that I wrote myself but I

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:39,380
haven't gone through all of the work of

00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:42,149
rewriting all of them for openSUSE the

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,910
poor one is based off of Alpine which is

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:48,600
the smallest district right now for it

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:52,230
for container images the WordPress and

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,740
my sequel are based off of Debian and

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:59,250
I've written rewritten the my sequel one

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,120
for force less once but I haven't

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,120
rewritten it for openSUSE

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,850
so we're gonna start the containers

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:28,569
docker compose up - d and that's it dr.

00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:32,480
PS we have three containers running

00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:35,509
they've been up for a few seconds

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,429
these are brand new thank you has them

00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,410
now so I've got a little command I'm

00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:46,779
going to run little script docker exec

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:50,389
and then the openSUSE tour a con tour

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,649
for one container and then onions onions

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:57,799
as the little script that gives us the

00:13:51,649 --> 00:14:01,040
hostname and there's our host name so

00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,689
anybody running the tor browser should

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,869
be able to open this and probably hack

00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:04,869
me

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:38,730
not the fastest application or you can

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:41,699
blame it on my laptop either way and you

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,069
might think well this is a VM you're

00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:49,139
connecting from your browser to the VM

00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:51,420
big deal no I'm going from this browser

00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,589
to Germany to Ireland to Netherlands to

00:14:51,420 --> 00:15:00,540
my VM each each of those hops has a next

00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:03,569
row as another layer of encryption this

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:08,069
is what's cool about this this VM has a

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:10,740
192 dot 168 IP I don't have access to

00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:13,350
this building's IP router I can't do any

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,420
kind of port forwarding what's happened

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,730
is that the port is that the tour

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,050
service went out to tour Network and

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:23,910
said hey I'm here here's my here's my

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,209
hostname and this is in this is what I'm

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,569
listening on the tor browser went out

00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:33,000
and said hey I've got this this hostname

00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:35,519
can you can you send me there and it

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,949
does it does not use real IP this is

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,879
actually running through UDP so that's

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:44,970
just a simple website

00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,360
it's simple WordPress installation not

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,509
the most you know interesting or secure

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,040
setup but it works and it works quickly

00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,379
that's was that's the power of

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,769
containers I didn't have to go here and

00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:02,100
set up a VM for you and then I could use

00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:05,250
salt I could use salt or whatever to set

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,309
up everything for you really quickly but

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:12,480
in this in this case setting up the

00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,550
container worked and it worked well but

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,720
that's not all

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,720
at my home laptop

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm running a gopher server on tour why

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:48,970
because when I run Tata Tomcat again

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,490
very simple configuration and we can

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,830
look at that that file is very similar

00:16:51,490 --> 00:17:01,270
VI M Necker compose again we're using

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:03,190
the Goldy image for tour and we're using

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,400
Tomcat which is based off of

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:09,939
openSUSE because I wrote this so you can

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,329
rent Tomcat but don't just take my word

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,329
for it

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:45,639
I know Tomcat normally runs on 8080 but

00:17:34,659 --> 00:18:02,200
I make it easy it helps if I get the

00:17:45,639 --> 00:18:04,870
right pass I pee our right host name so

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,460
we're running Tomcat over tor just a

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,399
matter of greening up the image and it

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:14,850
works and that's pretty much it I

00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:17,230
promise to keep this short and sweet and

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,629
we did the we did set up the entire

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,580
website entire WordPress website in less

00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,929
than 15 minutes if you want to play

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,059
around with tor this is an easy way to

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:41,500
do it especially if you're concerned

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:42,399
about security any questions yes you're

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,470
right

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:50,139
the best way to do it is to use a

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:54,340
hardened words a hardened web service

00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:56,559
like nginx docker does have some

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,559
hardened web services out there that you

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,090
can if you look in it look into but it's

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,490
really up to you you need to do that on

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,490
your own due diligence diligence on that

00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:25,570
anybody else excuse me there is there

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:30,279
has been some some experiment

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,990
experimenting with darker swarm but I

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,629
haven't gone into it that much I'm

00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,009
hoping this time next year I'll do one

00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:38,679
on how to do this do the same thing on

00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:42,120
kubernetes so we get true load balancing

00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,120
true distribution

00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:08,169
yes excuse me no there is no I have not

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,850
advertised a physical education at all

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,510
except for the fact that you know that

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:16,320
I'm here and I'm doing it but no you

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,130
need to be a real like government level

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,370
analyst to be able to find a physical

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:24,519
location what happened in the case of

00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:28,120
one of the black market are the darknet

00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,490
markets the person who who was running

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,799
that gave a lot of clues about himself

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,419
if he had just stayed quiet about who he

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,250
was he probably wouldn't have been

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:40,690
caught because it's very very difficult

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:44,110
to back-trace someone running at or

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:45,519
service the way they didn't normally do

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,799
that is either they do just normal

00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,720
detective work or there are ways such as

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:54,639
funding as a vulnerability in that in

00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:58,419
the tour in the tor browser hacking that

00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:59,799
and then that gives them away that's

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,659
what the government has told us so far I

00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:06,610
mean there might be other ways but

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:11,470
that's what they've released so far okay

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,909
anybody else okay

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,580
that's what we're gonna wrap it up then

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:21,840
and I hope everybody has a great rest of

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,840
the conference and thank you very much

00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,840
you

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,630
