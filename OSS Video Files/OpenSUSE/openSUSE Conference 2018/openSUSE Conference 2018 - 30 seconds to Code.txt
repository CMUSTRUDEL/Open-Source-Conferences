Streamlining development setups with Docker and Open Build Service

Creating development setups can be tedious, error-prone and quite horrifying to novice contributors of Open Source projects. You would set up a virtual machine, install
the required software and spend quite some time configuring it. On top of this, your setup would require maintenance and updates. A more
modern approach is featured in this talk: Create a reproducible environment, have automatic updates to new package versions just by using OBS to build
your Docker container image from RPMs and a kiwi XML file. No more fiddling with VMs, no more manual install and configuration marathons - just 
download and run your ready-to-use Docker image from OBS.
