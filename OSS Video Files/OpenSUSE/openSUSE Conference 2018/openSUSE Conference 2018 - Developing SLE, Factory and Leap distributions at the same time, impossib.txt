Starting with openSUSE Leap 42.2, a lot of cooperation has been done to bridge gaps between openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise distributions. Things have been improving nicely with openSUSE Leap 42.3.

We'll go into details on what this cooperation means for both openSUSE contributors and for SUSE and how we ensure it takes place. We will also discuss how we adjusted SLE15  development and how was done in harmony with openSUSE Tumbleweed (rolling release).
