Mycroft is an open source virtual assistant similar to the ones provided on phones by some companies. It provides some interesting functionality, it's open source, it's easily expanded with new functionality and it's fun. During the last hackweek, I packaged it so it's easy to install on Tumbleweed and in this talk I'll try to show how it works, the changes I did to it in order to package it and maybe how to add a new skill.
