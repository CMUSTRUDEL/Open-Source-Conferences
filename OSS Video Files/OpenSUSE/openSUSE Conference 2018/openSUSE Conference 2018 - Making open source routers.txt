At CZ.NIC, we are making open source routers. Those come with automatic updates, plenty of software available in repositories, root ssh account and other nice features. What challenges does it bring? How do we cope with them? Why would you want open source router anyway? What open  source project are we building on top? And what actually spinned off out of our router?

hi everybody

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,940
now I hope you enjoyed the launch and my

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,760
name is Makaha shitski i'm from company

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,970
called seize ethnic and i'm going to

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,369
talk about open source routers that we

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,490
are actually making I want to show you

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,710
not just the routers themselves but I

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,930
would like to speak a little bit about

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:37,020
why we do it and actually I would like

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,250
to stress out a few pieces of software

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,489
that we are using and how doing open

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,680
source actually make sense and how it

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,860
enables us to do awesome relatives

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,730
thanks to open source world and

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:58,920
communities around the world so a little

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,899
bit about our company it's well-known in

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,150
Czech Republic because we are actually

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,640
check top-level domain registry legally

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:14,310
we are some kind of association of

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,009
companies and but in fact in our bylaws

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,490
we have some statements that we are

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,280
basically run as a non-profit and the

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,320
association of companies is because yeah

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,000
check technical companies founded us and

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,400
they are competing with each other but

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,270
they all agree that they need a stable

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,000
check domain and stable internet and we

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,520
are we are supposed to make it happen

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,079
apart from domains we are doing some

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,829
other interesting open source

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,189
development we are doing bird internet

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,600
term routing daemon we are doing cannot

00:01:50,189 --> 00:02:01,530
DNS server and DNS resolver we are also

00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:05,310
doing some yeah education we are

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:09,330
publishing books about ipv6 gate

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,030
LibreOffice and stuff like that and we

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,930
have also some TV series that teaches

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,590
people

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,019
how

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,599
to use internet in a safe way so we are

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,950
trying to do good and educate people

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,769
about what to do and what to what not to

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:29,310
do on the Internet

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:32,730
and we are also doing those Wi-Fi odors

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:36,060
how did we get there and why we are

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:40,110
actually doing routers it all started

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,099
with good old stories this is the first

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,569
router that we made

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:48,230
it's a powerpc-based it had two cores

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,989
it had two gigs of RAM some storage

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,930
quite big for router the community

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,650
routers that you buy in grocery store

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:04,890
have something like 8 Meg's of RAM if

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:07,530
you are lucky so it was quite powerful

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,840
hardware and our goal wasn't actually to

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,000
make a router we just needed a powerful

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,060
hardware that we can give to people we

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,160
gave it to people in czech republic and

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,450
the only condition was that they will

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,940
allow us to spy on them basically our

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,790
goal wasn't to sell more ads or

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,370
something like that but our goal was to

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,150
actually figure out who's attacking home

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:36,660
users and how is the security at

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,340
people's home we do internet so we

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,859
developed some software that reported

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:47,430
some suspicious activities send us

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:49,769
firewall rocks and even acted as a part

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,849
of honeypot kind now we get to the

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,859
honeypot later and we got all these data

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,099
and we did some security research on top

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:02,989
of it apart from that since we were

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:07,560
doing router we decided to do it right

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:09,299
so we provide security updates and not

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,019
only security updates but also feature

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:17,250
updates we are not restricting features

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:18,690
based on model but whatever can run we

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,109
are trying to provide it even though

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,400
even to those all the alters even the

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,620
new features that we are still

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,900
developing

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,580
and we obviously give people route

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,530
account on their router because it's

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,979
their device so they deserve to be route

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:39,680
and they deserve to be in control of

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:43,010
their devices so we did this and then

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,930
our colleagues were going on conferences

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:51,220
around the world and now presenting what

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:55,370
security research day that they did and

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:59,510
what they found and they found out that

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,100
apart from the security research that

00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,900
was really interesting for some people

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,150
people are really interested in the

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,850
router itself because they said that

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:12,139
it's cool device and they want it as

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,750
well but we basically do digital device

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:17,750
by ourselves we gave it to people in

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,600
Czech Republic because it was financed

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,729
by money from Czech domains so we didn't

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,820
felt it was right to basically give it

00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:29,060
to anybody around the world then

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,300
basically Czech people paid for the

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,000
domains and gave us the money to make it

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,330
so we did something that people can

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,360
actually buy and it was called tourism

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,320
Nia I had a talk here two years ago when

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:49,190
we were now building it it's something

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,849
that people can buy all our spyware is

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,340
optional you can still join our research

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,440
security research program so you can

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,650
still send us all the data that you

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,590
collect and help us improve security on

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,150
the internet but it's your device you

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,789
can do whatever you want you can

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:12,500
reinstall it you can run different

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:17,360
distribution like openSUSE and it's even

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,090
more powerful and it's interesting one

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
one other interesting part is that it

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:28,310
has re7 so it's much more mainstream

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:31,880
platform and it has so yeah some switch

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,820
plenty of ports SFP some PCI Express

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,250
slots mSATA basically we put in

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,180
everything that we thought that might be

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,110
useful

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,300
so it does everything the downside of

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,170
doing everything and having everything

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,550
is the price tag it's between 2 and 300

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:55,970
euros and people were saying that they

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,750
really love the device but they would

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:03,800
prefer if they can they don't need all

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,200
those stuff that we put in that they

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,970
would all like it just with one PCI

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,370
Express and they don't need all those

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,440
Ethernet ports and stuff like that and

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,330
can we make it a little bit cheaper

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,530
please

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:22,040
so we tries to make everybody happy and

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:24,710
we came up with a new router that we are

00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:28,550
currently running on IndieGoGo campaign

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:32,240
and we actually made the go so it's

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,620
going to be done we met the goal

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,820
something like last week

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,560
and yeah we are trying to make everybody

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,880
happy and how do we do that

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,420
well we decided to make it modular so

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,840
yeah I have I have it here so basically

00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,780
what we have is a CPU module it's this

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,990
one it has just CPU usb3

00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:00,290
and it starts from 29th

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:04,100
US Dollars and yeah it has Gigabit

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:07,010
Ethernet but if you need more you can

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:12,310
just buy another extension module plug

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:16,010
it in and you can have another

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,890
capabilities like this is a PCI Express

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,680
with Wi-Fi card we have some switches

00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,940
some of them can be even chained we have

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,000
SFP so you can decide what what

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,970
components you need and you can extend

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,100
it as much as you want well there are

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,600
some technical limitations but within

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,090
that you can extend it and and if you

00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,680
don't need those additional interfaces

00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,680
you don't have to buy them

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:58,850
so is it still rotor well it can route

00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:01,950
it can have even 25 internet ports

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:05,610
gigabit ones it can have Wi-Fi so it is

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,910
a router but in more general sense it is

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,360
actually kind of single single board

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:18,000
computer that can be made into router it

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:21,420
is it doesn't have any GPU so it's not

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,160
your multimedia Center but it has

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,410
gigabit it has USB 3 so and it has

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,810
plenty of extensions so you can make it

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:37,980
what you want and it can be even your

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:44,340
home server so little side note it comes

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,410
with you boot at least this version we

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,260
are actually pushing all the patches to

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,650
upstream and quite some are there

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,400
already so we will probably at some

00:09:52,650 --> 00:10:00,080
point to rebase even on newer you boot

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,080
it has Marvell Armada

00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:11,390
37:20 and it will be shipping with 4.14

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:14,430
kernel so it looks promising from

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:23,670
openSUSE point of view so let's take a

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:27,030
look how it how it actually works good

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:31,620
big data library so I will I decided to

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:36,050
do at least a live demo so we have a

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,050
grap and

00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,610
let's see how far we will get basically

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,400
what we did I was speaking with Andrews

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,610
here we downloaded open source a

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,510
tumbleweed image basically put it on the

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,220
flash drive

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:58,640
currently we copied DTB on the flash

00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:04,570
drive as well but in the end we hope

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:07,580
that we will somehow handle DTB inside

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:11,810
you boot in the production unit

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:19,670
so hopefully you wouldn't need even that

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:22,250
and it's starting booting and hopefully

00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:26,300
we will get to the lucky ending happy

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:35,080
ending it worked

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:38,150
sir oh yeah for those who don't know

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,550
there is something called device 3 on

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:45,620
arm devices which basically describes

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:50,180
the hardware and it's called well device

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:53,230
to be binary is dtb and yeah all those

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,780
devices have support in the kernel and

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,250
you just need to say which peripherals

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:05,090
are where connected and how to access

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:08,570
them so that's what the dtb is for we

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:11,840
have SPI nor various already you boot we

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,120
will probably have somehow DTB inside as

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,750
well in the final units this is just a

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,950
prototype

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:23,920
so basically when we copy to dtb over to

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:28,570
tumble it image it booted like this and

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,570
we have openSUSE running on top of it

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:36,890
but apart from that we are developing

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:39,830
our own system for it because well we

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:43,010
want to make it not only secure but also

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:46,090
user friendly and being actually

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:50,350
security not only to

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:54,520
advanced users but to some home users

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,050
that's and we are trying to simplify

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,070
those security features that you might

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,210
be interested in

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,420
so even beginners can configure VPN and

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:08,360
stuff like that

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,370
well one use case for that and what we

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,740
actually decided that would be a nice

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:19,190
fit is a next cloud some people are

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,260
asking for it and actually it makes

00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,010
sense to combine our efforts because

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:29,060
what Mexico guys are doing is they are

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:33,200
trying to get you easy way how to solve

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:35,860
hosts and manage your data in private

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,470
way so you have control over your data

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,880
and what we are trying to do is make

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,960
sure that your home network is secure

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,340
and that your gateway to your home

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:52,550
network is secure so we actually have

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,520
something for kind of ultimate self

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:59,710
hosting something that can be run can be

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:04,490
running in your home doesn't take that

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:08,120
large amount of electricity you have a

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:14,030
root account on it you have those

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:15,470
automatic updates so it's always secure

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,380
and we have some additional security

00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,870
features that we are providing we have a

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,180
nice web interface that allows people to

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:31,550
actually set up the device from the

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:34,520
start so yeah it makes sense so we as I

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:38,420
said we have a nice easy open VPN

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,270
support so people can create a VPN

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,850
server on our routers really easily

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,190
there is a web-based wizard that will

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,700
basically create certification authority

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,610
for you and will let you generate client

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,490
certificate and clients configurations

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,670
it's not that hard but even though I

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,760
know how to do it manually it's tedious

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,760
work

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:07,720
yeah you didn't want to generate SSL

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,810
Certificates using open SSL and remember

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,450
all the parameters and in months

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:17,470
you were forget how you did it and yeah

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:19,330
so we did a easy open VPN support we

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,120
have automatic updates that gets

00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,760
downloaded and your author can be

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,800
updated regularly you can just set it up

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:32,530
once and then it will get it will stay

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,780
up to date and all the security issues

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:41,350
will get patched so even the about we

00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:43,600
have next cloud packages ready so your

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,610
next cloud will get updated even if you

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,080
access it just via the next cloud

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,640
application on your cell phone or

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,160
something else and even if you don't log

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,990
in to the next crowd you can have it

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,990
updated automatically by the system

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,050
newly we have even some web interface to

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,630
actually format and set up hard drive so

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,540
it will be mounted and there are still

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,380
some things that we plan to do and that

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,440
we are working on and that's extend web

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:22,630
interface to actually allow setting up a

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:26,140
write and make it even easier to install

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,080
the next code from the web UI so that's

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,990
what we plan to do and it makes quite

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,790
sense with mocks because yeah

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,570
it doesn't have to have all those

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,030
Ethernet ports and y5s it can be just an

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:44,950
ass box we actually have a extension

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,730
module that provides for USB 3 ports so

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,620
you can connect hard drives from the

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:54,970
grocery store that you thought that you

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,730
will be buying your of the from one

00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:02,440
thing that we had on our routers from

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:04,270
the beginning was kinda honeypot and it

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,640
was something that we dedicated to our

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:09,250
routers it was one of our cool features

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,510
but people kept asking whether they can

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,930
run it even on their server

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,459
and we actually made it possible now

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:22,880
it's called the honeypot as a service

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:25,250
and basically how it works is that yeah

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,620
honey pots are cool and fun and it's

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,720
real fun to learn attackers into your

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,190
honeypot and see what they are doing

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:36,860
yeah but there is still some small risk

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:39,140
they if they are clever enough they

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,010
might try to break through and they

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,650
might escape at some point so the

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:49,100
solution is let somebody else run

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,840
honeypot for you and we will do it for

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,060
you

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,780
you can register on our website and

00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:00,530
install simple proxy package

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:04,220
it's available in leap 15 and double it

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,260
and this proxy package will basically do

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:11,030
many in the middle on the attacker and

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:13,460
send it send him to our servers so he

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:17,120
will think that he will he actually

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:20,150
attacked your router and his step closer

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,490
to building his own botnet but in fact

00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:29,780
he's running on seasonique servers in

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:34,850
honeypot and you were just you are just

00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:39,140
providing him there to show you how it

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:42,380
looks this is the website and when you

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:45,020
log in now yeah we have some global

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:49,010
statistics so even if you don't

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,500
participate you can see who is the most

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,500
evil country and

00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:02,850
and you can even get some data of what

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,430
attackers are usually doing but if you

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,560
register you can add your devices and

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:13,320
you can see who was attacking actually

00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:15,870
you and what password were using and how

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,390
many commands did they run and you can

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,210
actually take a look at the whole

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:28,020
session what the attacker was trying to

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:33,210
do and you get also statistics your

00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:37,920
device's so you can see that your router

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:41,700
is hated by China and your server is

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:51,300
hated by Poland and stuff like that so

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:53,580
it's fun so that's one of the services

00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:59,400
that we developed for our routers but

00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:02,220
then they splits to a separate project

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,400
and now you can use it even on your

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,880
server and you don't need the router to

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,110
actually use it

00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:17,580
another thing that allows us to do quite

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:20,810
some stuff on our router is open source

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,810
software codes Rakata

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:31,470
what is it good for it's it's good when

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,280
you're a simple firewall when where you

00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,710
just block ports is not enough and if

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,930
you want to have some more information

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,720
about what's going on in your network

00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:48,570
and basically what's going on between

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:53,430
internet and your network it's intuition

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:58,080
detection and prevention system it works

00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,320
with some kind of network flows and it

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
can

00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:32,299
okay sorry for the delay

00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:36,830
batteries run out so where was I

00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:39,440
so we get that you can it can look much

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,840
deeper inside the packet and it can

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:47,629
actually parse the data that are going

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,999
to and interpret them somehow so you can

00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:53,539
load the information you can then

00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:56,779
process it somehow I think on the first

00:21:53,539 --> 00:22:01,519
day there was a talk by peter chen ik

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:05,119
about syslog-ng and he showed quite some

00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:09,320
examples what you can do with lots that

00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:13,970
contain interesting data and yeah he

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,909
loves to play with walks and in his talk

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:19,820
he actually made it sound interesting

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:22,039
looking at at the locks so if you get

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:26,840
that data you can do plenty of the stuff

00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:30,009
with data but apart from logging what's

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:33,710
going on and doing some statistics and

00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,409
maybe even getting some alerts it's also

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:39,440
interesting that you can actually write

00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:41,989
the rules you can detect the stuff that

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,710
you are interested in get some alerts

00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:48,349
and you can even block this stuff so

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,440
what stuff you can actually do from the

00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:58,820
traffic when it's actually most of the

00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:01,269
time and gripped it anyway so you can

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,659
get all the unencrypted communication

00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:09,200
which is basically nowadays there is a

00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:11,710
DNS most of the time most of them most

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,129
of the time people still don't use TLS

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:19,029
for DNS but even in encrypted traffic

00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:21,879
there are stuff like certificates that

00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:26,599
are presented when you are connecting

00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:28,729
SNES yes um another interesting talk

00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:33,440
that was here yesterday I think there

00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:38,779
was TOS 1.3 talk and yeah as a nice

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,889
wouldn't be available in new TLS but you

00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:44,149
still get some information about

00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:47,509
certificate and yeah sure you can get

00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:50,450
our IP address MAC addresses how long

00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:54,070
did the connection take amount of data

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:57,879
and stuff like that and you can allow it

00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:03,649
when you see something interesting so

00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:06,349
some examples yeah okay so one more

00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:10,669
slide about what you can do with it you

00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:14,480
can monitor devices you don't trust for

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:17,389
example if if you get a device that is

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,909
not so friendly as ours and you don't

00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:22,820
have a root account on it and you have a

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:24,470
new TV and you have no idea what the TV

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,980
is doing on your internet or your

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,239
washing machine or or your fridge and

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,359
you want to know what they are doing you

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:35,929
can spy on them and see how much they

00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,639
are connecting to somewhere if they are

00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:40,669
using unencrypted traffic you can see

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:43,340
what they are actually doing my TV is

00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:49,539
regularly producing Baidu for some

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:52,039
reason and I haven't discovered why it

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:55,999
yeah you can try to detect this kind of

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:59,539
stuff there is also a large collection

00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:01,669
of rules available for su kata already

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:04,549
which are trying to detect virus

00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:08,059
malware's and behaviors that mowers are

00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:12,710
doing the typical behavior that some

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:16,099
Mars and yeah you can write your own own

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:23,479
rules detect what you care of care about

00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:26,169
and block it so this is just some

00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:30,229
example of what you can get from the

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:33,279
flow you get some information when when

00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:38,599
the session started how long it lasted

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:41,809
how many data was transferred but let's

00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:45,440
take a look at the interesting bits for

00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:49,549
example if we get TOS connection so

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,690
basically somebody accessing

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:55,940
a server in encrypted way you still get

00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:00,100
information about what server what

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:05,720
company issued a certificate usually

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:08,059
what server it is issued for and much

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,840
more data and everything you can see

00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:14,749
here is actually what you can match and

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:18,409
create alerts on top of and what you can

00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:20,179
actually use to block stuff so you can

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,320
just write some simple rules that say

00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:27,249
hey if there is a facebook.com/ in

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,509
certificate block this connection and

00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,999
yeah it wouldn't help you

00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,700
if the device already has established

00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:37,249
secure connection but it will actually

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:48,529
allow you to block the establishing of

00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:56,119
the secure connection so this one this

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:58,720
one yeah for yeah one thing that we are

00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,720
using it for

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:07,340
I was yeah we have a website that we

00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:11,749
developed it's basically demo website of

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,989
our go-to interface so we can look at it

00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:16,460
a lighter a little bit and one thing

00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:18,440
that we are using so ricotta for is

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,299
basically to give you some overview of

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,460
your traffic

00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:28,730
so in our after we we are using su kata

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,909
to monitor your network if you install

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:36,350
it and then we are collecting some data

00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:39,470
about where you went which device is

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,139
connected where what protocols and we

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,539
are getting we are we are matching all

00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:48,460
those flows with the names of the

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:52,340
service that you are accessing we don't

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:55,340
the the interesting part about this is

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,909
that you don't see just the IP address

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:02,960
of the server that you try to access if

00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:03,530
we saw DNS query before we remember it

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,090
so

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:11,870
we know what mod hostname your computer

00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:18,050
was searching for and the IP was the

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:22,220
answer to and if we see SSL handshake

00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:25,460
and we can deduct hostname from it we

00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:29,270
use that one as it is even more precise

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,810
information why is it important is that

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:38,420
you have those web postings that have

00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:41,930
tons of websites on one one IP and you

00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,800
might be interested in which one was the

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:49,310
computer actually trying to access

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:54,130
whether it was some cooking site but it

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:57,410
was some how to make a bomb site

00:28:54,130 --> 00:29:00,770
so yeah you need to distinguish between

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:03,380
those and that's what we are doing and

00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:08,120
we are presenting it it in user friendly

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:12,230
way so since I use this opportunity to

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:15,200
show you this site let's take a look at

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,790
what else do we have here this is our

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,770
web interface

00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:22,010
I was already speaking about some

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:25,130
settings yeah one important lesson that

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:29,300
we learned from all those honey pots if

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,760
you remember it yeah if you look at them

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:39,230
most of the passwords and login

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:41,410
informations are quite simple yep yes

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,410
sir

00:29:53,409 --> 00:30:03,349
see okay so now it's visible yeah so

00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:05,419
yeah sorry did you sort the stuff that I

00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:10,129
was showing before or are you just

00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:13,249
afraid to ask that you don't see it so

00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:14,739
yeah this is the list of people that

00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:18,919
were trying to attack one of my

00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:22,029
computer's and yeah you see even here

00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:24,080
that one thing that people are trying is

00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:28,940
open it open it

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,489
there is also similar default passwords

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,869
for ubiquity rafters and stuff like that

00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:38,330
so one thing that we did in our web

00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:40,339
interface is that there is a first round

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,129
wizard that you have to go through to

00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:46,580
actually get access to the Internet and

00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:50,149
the first first step of this wizard is

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,039
setting up your password so there is no

00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:59,059
default password and you have to set it

00:30:52,039 --> 00:31:02,149
up before you connect to internet then

00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:04,719
we have these notifications those can be

00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:07,809
sent to your email address as well so

00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:12,979
even though router updates automatically

00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:15,019
you get emails when it does and what it

00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:20,029
install and you still have some

00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:22,759
informations about rate one thing that

00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:25,580
we are doing little bit differently is

00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:31,279
also that we are doing DNS SEC

00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:35,690
validation by default woof you don't

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:42,259
well it's easier to ask who hurt and

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:46,839
know what is DNS sack okay so about the

00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:49,700
third of audience that's kind of good

00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:55,099
yeah DNS SEC is basically a way to

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:58,309
actually sign your zone data and yeah

00:31:55,099 --> 00:32:02,089
basically your ISP is usually providing

00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:03,640
it you with DNS resolver but unless you

00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:06,370
verify the peace

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,320
and verified data that he is sending to

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,660
you you can try to redirect to somewhere

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,960
else to some other server even if you

00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:17,040
try to access something that's commonly

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:21,010
used in some cafes and restaurants

00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:24,809
basically you ask for some server and

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:28,110
they've already active to their portal

00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:33,790
so to avoid being redirected to

00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:38,970
malicious site like a portal you can use

00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:41,470
the NSX to validate the answers and

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:46,390
that's something that we have enabled by

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:51,790
default and because quite some ISPs has

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:55,150
have broken dns servers we can run full

00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,940
resolver on our router and it will

00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:06,460
resolve DNS by it by itself so we can

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:09,580
avoid broken DNS servers of your ISP and

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,309
what I wanted to show as well is a VPN

00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:16,870
configuration how it looks like I said

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:20,370
that it's simple at the beginning you

00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:22,600
just say that you want to generate

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,960
certification Authority and it will do

00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:33,400
everything and yeah it shows some

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:37,780
settings but you can change the IP but

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:41,919
if you don't it will work and it allows

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:44,770
you even to make make it so that all the

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,370
traffic will go to your VPN so if you

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:51,700
are in some countries that you know that

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:55,360
they are spying on you you can use VPN

00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,400
if they wouldn't block everything to

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,549
actually connect and go through your

00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:05,140
home network and send all your traffic

00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:09,490
to your home and when you want to create

00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:14,879
some client for your VPN you just enter

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:14,879
the client name yeah is it

00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:25,220
okay yeah usually all these data

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:29,750
projectors has lousy resolution so

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:36,340
everything is big but at this conference

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:40,460
we have a high resolution Beamer so yeah

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:43,270
so you just enter the name of your

00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,370
client click create button and it will

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:50,570
generate the configuration and then you

00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:54,530
can get a config that is that contains

00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:56,840
all the certificates embedded so you can

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,820
just have a one file copy to your

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:06,920
Android phone or your computer and

00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:12,830
connect to your VPN another interesting

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:16,370
part that we did is some measuring of

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:18,500
network connectivity so we have some

00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:23,330
software that can periodically measure

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:26,360
your speed so you can have idea of how

00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,370
go to your connection is and when you

00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,810
are sharing it with multiple people how

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:40,880
much bandwidth do you have at some point

00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:45,050
in time so I think that was all that I

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:49,190
have prepared few pointers at the end

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:51,500
that's our main website decide that I

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,870
was clicking to and showing you how it

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:59,270
works is called demo dots to see that

00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:00,560
honeypot as a service can be find on can

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:05,870
be found on Hoss

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:09,320
Nick sees at 3 smokes which is the new

00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:14,930
modular router you can get on IndieGoGo

00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,700
and we are making open-source devices so

00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:19,780
there is link to our get lab that

00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,210
contains plenty of projects that are

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:28,520
that have sources for the stuff that we

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:32,380
are using in our routers so thank you

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,380
for attention and now do you have some

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,759
yeah thanks Michael it's very very

00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:00,339
enlightening so if some of us would like

00:36:57,759 --> 00:37:02,079
to contribute software and feedback

00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:04,569
that's understandable what about the

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,720
hardware engineers who are interested in

00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:08,859
taking your designs extending them

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,019
manipulating improving or maybe making

00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,339
their own modules for the the new

00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:16,119
architecture okay

00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:19,989
so regarding the hardware I didn't

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:22,960
mention it that much but we have a full

00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:33,700
schematics online so you can read up how

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:35,680
the hardware is connected and layout

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:39,420
schematics is good layout is better

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,279
kicad something open-source

00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,049
unfortunately I think that the layout

00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,289
was done in some proprietary software

00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:49,839
because our hardware guys had some

00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,180
troubles making it in open-source one

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,700
for some reason I'm not a hardware guy

00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:58,390
so I I don't know the details but they

00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:02,470
run into some troubles in there and we

00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:06,190
don't currently release a whole PCB

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:09,069
layout as it is because we have they are

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,920
trying to make those routers and we

00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:14,529
don't want cheap knockoffs but we've

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:19,180
already said once we stopped making them

00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:25,089
and regarding the new twist mark so

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:28,980
there is some specification yeah I'm not

00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:28,980
sure whether I will find it

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:36,130
ok probably I wouldn't find it right now

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:39,489
but somewhere on our website there is a

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:43,450
complete specification about the

00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:45,640
connector what we are using for yeah for

00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,940
what we are using for connecting virus

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,029
modules is basically PCI connector that

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,059
can be found anywhere it's not some

00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:57,819
special proprietary connector the tricky

00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:00,849
part is wiring we are not using the

00:38:57,819 --> 00:39:04,210
classic of PCI but we are using we are

00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:08,499
passing to PCI and

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:11,739
s GMI and various other stuff

00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:14,410
there is also electricity and some power

00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:16,599
and stuff like that but we have some

00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:20,430
documentation online what you can find

00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:31,359
on which pins and that's probably all

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:33,210
you need to develop your own module so a

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,460
couple of questions first of all

00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:38,769
obviously when some of us power users

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,200
are trying to hack on those devices then

00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:43,569
you know we can get by with having an

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,119
SSH interface and so on what do you

00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:49,109
think would be necessary or what do you

00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:53,140
see as the missing bits in order to make

00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:55,809
the browser comfortably usable for

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,609
average users on an openSUSE basis like

00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:00,460
do you think it would be possible to

00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:02,529
take the web interface and just package

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,920
that for for openSUSE

00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:11,619
well the tricky part is that the web

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:15,730
interface is kind of tied to the kind of

00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:18,579
title files of open wrt yeah we are we

00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:22,809
are based yeah I think I maybe didn't

00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:25,829
mention it but we are running on our of

00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:29,529
just open wrt Linux distribution

00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:32,200
therefore stuff that is available for

00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:35,920
open wrt is available for our office as

00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,650
well and the tricky part is if you want

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:45,400
to have our similar user experience on

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:48,430
openSUSE based system open wrt has some

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,950
specific some specifics regarding the

00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:54,460
configuration of the stuff so you would

00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,619
have to really implement that part but

00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:02,140
the web interface is actually written in

00:40:56,619 --> 00:41:05,920
Python and nowadays it's not that tight

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:08,230
due to the actual open lab reality there

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,309
is some back-end and front back end and

00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:16,930
front end and you just need to there's

00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:20,230
some generalization some abstraction

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,630
layer in between so you just need to

00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:27,670
implement the back end and you can use

00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:30,329
all the front-end or there is a system

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,329
manager right

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:45,010
and I think web-based is dead right yeah

00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,430
I do

00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:52,059
yes so you talked about this ricotta

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,319
yeah framework did I understand

00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,450
correctly that this is something that

00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:57,970
you have developed on your own no no

00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,799
that's one of the open source projects

00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:07,329
that we use there is a huge community

00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:10,299
around it it's yeah and we just all kind

00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:14,920
of abused it too currently do the simple

00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:17,530
simple overview of your network network

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,530
traffic in the future we want to

00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:22,480
implement even the rules but it's a

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,450
generic open-source project and being

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,549
open source actually enables us it's a

00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,579
nice example where being open source

00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:33,190
actually enables us to do quite some

00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:35,410
interesting stuff without too much

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,119
effort without basically writing it from

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,630
the scratch we can use open source

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,970
software and provide our users with

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:46,900
extra functionality right but there's it

00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:48,099
there's not just one dpi open source

00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,200
project right there's also someone

00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,490
called snort you know some couple of

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,869
others do you have any overview like

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,339
what the differences are and why so

00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:59,799
ricotta is best well I wouldn't say that

00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:03,220
I have a huge overview of all of those

00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:07,690
and we just pick the circuit ax because

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:10,180
we liked it yeah if you like snore too

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:13,900
can use snort I think we have it in our

00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:16,390
repositories as well at some point not

00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,119
sure about the current state whether it

00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:21,690
builds or stuff like that and not sure

00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,030
whether other stuff from this area

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,770
builds and how well they're they run we

00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,450
just took some extra efforts to

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,839
integrate ricotta because we liked it

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,520
and we liked the community around it

00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,069
then third question the honeypot as a

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,180
service if we install that on an

00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:39,430
openSUSE system

00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,550
are there any configuration settings

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,349
necessary or like are you if you're

00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,319
redirecting the traffic from the local

00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:49,630
system to your servers is there any QoS

00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:51,640
insurance or traffic shaping going on to

00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:58,980
assure that they cannot do s the actual

00:43:51,640 --> 00:44:04,930
router I don't think there is some PQ

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:08,770
QoS you can probably set it up in your

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:10,599
system and there is some minimal

00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:14,230
configuration that you have to do

00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:16,540
basically if you want to track your when

00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,260
you want to track stuff you have to

00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,930
generate some token and insert the token

00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:27,339
into the configuration file and I think

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:30,220
that's the most important part then yeah

00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:33,400
you obviously want to run it on port 22

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,859
on SSH port so it probably needs to move

00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,530
your SSH somewhere else open up the port

00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:41,880
on the firewall and make sure that you

00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:45,190
can connect to the different port before

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,060
yeah cutting you cutting yourself out of

00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:53,130
your books but yeah I think I actually

00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:55,839
wrote a blog post how to do that when I

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,930
packaged I only put as a service for

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:03,040
openSUSE so it's somewhere on Planet

00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:05,109
openSUSE but yeah the configuration

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,310
should be pretty easy and pretty simple

00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:12,520
so most of the time you just need the

00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:15,130
token from the website and if you are

00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,910
happy with the default settings then you

00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,829
are all done

00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,490
QoS you have to implement yourself

00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:20,490
somehow

00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:29,829
yeah two things I mean I don't think you

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,990
mentioned when the Taurus mocks is

00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:36,970
starts delivery or when it should be

00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:41,770
done current plan is that most of the

00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:43,569
base modules should be I think we

00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:48,069
promised something like October

00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:51,670
so generally end of the year some of the

00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:57,130
new modules like the USB one and nice

00:45:51,670 --> 00:46:00,190
through past few modules will take some

00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,240
extra time and I think the scheduled

00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:07,089
date is something like December because

00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,549
the those are the ones that we started

00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:14,530
to work on lighter and there are more

00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:16,359
complex so it took us it will it took us

00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,720
some more time to prototype them and

00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:23,980
yeah there is still some work ongoing on

00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:28,299
those third question but first a second

00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:30,460
I saw you opened or kept the

00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:34,450
fund-raising open a little longer

00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:35,410
are you can extend it again we cannot

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:38,740
extend it again

00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:41,380
but I think that it can be changed to in

00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:45,030
demand mode or something like that where

00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:49,089
people will be able to buy our

00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:53,230
additional devices and stuff but yeah

00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:55,030
that's something that our marketing and

00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,880
business people do I'm just a developer

00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:05,020
so I don't I don't see into that stuff

00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:09,730
that much there might be some it might

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:12,960
get a little bit more expensive and yeah

00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:15,609
it will eventually gets to retail but

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,670
yeah if you support us now in the

00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:20,650
campaign there is some discount for it

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:24,490
yeah it's like a week longer I think it

00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:27,250
really it should end next Thursday all

00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:30,610
right cool

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:33,850
and then last one was like you mentioned

00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,680
open wrt that you guys use and and and

00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:39,430
some other projects I mean how much do

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:46,810
you guys contribute back upstream dip

00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:49,119
are we are trying to get to but we

00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:55,119
contributed some patches to open wrt

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:59,080
currently we are yeah it was so there

00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:03,010
were some Forks and difficult situations

00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,990
in open wrt community and in between we

00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,200
accumulated plenty of changes that we

00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:13,270
are trying to clean up now and basically

00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:16,600
ditch everything that we forked and

00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:18,010
didn't have to and we are trying to

00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,610
polish all the patches and send it

00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:26,110
upstream or regarding the MOX you put

00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:29,290
that we that you saw is basically almost

00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,320
upstream I think that my Creek said send

00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:38,980
said me that he had to refracture some

00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:41,950
patch so it might not be in upstream yet

00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,869
everything but there is a huge part that

00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:47,290
is already upstream and the plan is to

00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:49,030
be to have everything upstream we want

00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:52,119
to upstream the kernel support as well

00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:55,750
while we are waiting for some other

00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:59,050
subsystems also to upstream their

00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:08,170
patches but yeah we are we will try to

00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:11,650
push everything upstream as we can yeah

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:16,140
we are trying to yeah we had we had

00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:19,780
quite some changes in old open wrt 3

00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,000
before it settled somehow and it's hard

00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,859
to March but we are trying to clean it

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,859
up and slowly push everything

00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:36,600
you tested much with pfsense mana wall

00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:42,840
or these class of router software

00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:47,700
packages i pfSense is bsd right yes we

00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:50,690
don't have BSD we have Linux so so

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:55,860
unfortunately that blocks us from using

00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:57,930
pfSense so we didn't trial it but we

00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:02,610
actually there was some question on our

00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:05,910
IndieGoGo somebody asked us about bsd

00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:07,860
support we told them that basically well

00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:10,350
we have limited resources so we are

00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:15,330
trying to focus on what we shipped by

00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:17,910
default but they said that CPU shouldn't

00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:23,390
be that bit hard and it should be

00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:29,360
somehow supported in FreeBSD so yeah

00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:29,360
somebody might do the port for openSUSE

00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:38,280
under us did a lot of work on omnia so

00:50:35,420 --> 00:51:08,430
yeah if we get somebody like Andrus in

00:50:38,280 --> 00:51:10,920
FreeBSD there will be FreeBSD port so

00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:17,910
there are no closed firmware blobs

00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:22,560
necessary to run this device in omnia we

00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:27,570
are we were using a th 10k Wi-Fi cards

00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:31,140
which requires member but all well all

00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:35,010
our cards are not soldered in so you can

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:41,550
replace them and I'm not sure about

00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:56,550
Armada and ATF and those weird secure v8

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:59,490
stuff do you know for the Amada 8 k 4 on

00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:02,970
the macchiato pin there is a free art

00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:05,340
us-based blob that is being used for a

00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:08,280
cortex-m processor that's part of the

00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,320
DSR and for that I have not yet found

00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:19,110
the corresponding sources but in theory

00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:21,680
it should be possible to yeah well all

00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,300
the software that we are compiling is

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:29,670
open source but we have we are using

00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:36,150
some tools to flesh u-boot I'm not sure

00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:39,330
how well they are in supported by Marvel

00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:44,940
that's something that our criminal guys

00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:50,270
mostly deal with but kernel is open

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:56,340
source you boot as well user space

00:52:50,270 --> 00:53:01,140
yeah not sure about these really really

00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:03,450
low-level stuff so flashing you boot

00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,790
should be possible via you put itself

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,950
yes which requires to have a working you

00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:10,680
put on the device if you have one you're

00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:14,130
good if it somehow bricked and I think

00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:18,600
there's closed tools from Marvel for the

00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:20,130
3700 I mean would probably engineer that

00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,190
but that would take someone with the

00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:25,910
time and desire to do that

00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:29,270
yeah yeah we would have we would have a

00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:33,170
desire I'm not sure whether we will have

00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:37,550
all the time right now and frankly I I

00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:40,520
have no idea how what is state on those

00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:42,560
low level stuff but yeah it can boot

00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:47,750
over this area we did those Marvel tools

00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:51,650
and we are shipping with yeah the Mach

00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:53,990
saw is mocks has a spi nor and we are

00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,580
shipping with you boot already so you

00:53:53,990 --> 00:54:06,410
have a working you boot that you can

00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:07,940
start from I think else no then thank

00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:11,060
you for your attention and if you have

00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:15,980
any extra questions find me somewhere

00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,960
out there or come to our forum or mail

00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,960
us or something
