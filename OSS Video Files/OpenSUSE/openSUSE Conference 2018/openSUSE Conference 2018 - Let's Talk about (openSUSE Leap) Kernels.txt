With openSUSE Leap, we've tried a new management model based on SLE.  The same is true for the kernel, one of the most "core" packages in the whole distribution.  However, in the case of kernels, a story is a bit different from others.

In this talk, we'll take a look back at the history of openSUSE Leap kernel developments and maintenance from Leap 42.1 to 42.3, covering briefly about the concept of openSUSE Leap kernels, how they are packaged, and how they are maintained.  This will show us a light and a shadow in the paths we've gone through, as well as the open question to a future development of Leap 15 series.
