Title: openSUSE Conference 2018 - SVG as the single source of truth
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2018
Description: 
	The designer version control of the future?

SVG is magical when you think about it. It's one of the few formats both developers and designers can interact with. With the rise of SVG compatibility on the web, the format has enjoyed various new use cases with the HTML5 specification. Could it be used as a common file format both designers and developers can collaborate together? As SVG is basically just lines of code, shouldn't designers benefit from this vizualised version control without going through the painful git learning process? SVG could be the meeting point for version control powered by git, both suitable for developers but also designers. Let's talk about how this could look like with Free Open Source Software like Identihub, a potential frontend for version controlling visual assets in the future.

you

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:23,750
last time ahead is I had short hair okay

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:27,080
perfect so good morning I'm a Leo and we

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:29,180
gotta talk today is about SVG's chances

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,970
are that you've heard about it at one

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:36,190
moment or the other doesn't matter if

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:39,320
you if you are a developer or designer

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:43,460
or whatever else you can find it

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,330
anywhere on the web nowadays so a few

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,979
things about me

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:51,739
I'm until attack speaker so we travel

00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,989
quite a bit around especially in Europe

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:57,640
and give talks about open web

00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:00,080
technologies and Mozilla technologies

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,420
because like there are so many

00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,339
open-source technologies it doesn't

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,110
matter only to Mozilla but also to a lot

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:11,660
of people so SVG is one of them and

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,460
actually I'm also a designer at uni a

00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,980
part of the Tor project we measure

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,610
Internet censorship so if you are not

00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:21,140
from a first world country like Czech

00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,910
Germany or Switzerland

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,040
you might want to try to use it because

00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:28,060
like you might find out some quite

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
interesting censorship happening also

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,980
I'm also a member of open labs hacker

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,350
space in Tirana Albania for the past

00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:41,060
five years and yeah it's one of the

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,540
first open source communities there as

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,290
well and the thing I'm going to talk a

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,780
bit bit more today as and I dent here

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,580
which are open source design projects

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,979
basically design communities but with

00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:05,479
open source values helping open source

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:08,750
software so we founded that in 2016 with

00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,849
just the perm just the idea that we got

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,459
a lot of projects saying hey man can you

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:16,910
help me with that I need a logo I need a

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:19,700
website for that and it was been mostly

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,069
open source projects and I must say that

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,910
their design really lacked really badly

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,400
and in the first I started helping but

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,050
then I thought okay all these people are

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,129
coming to me that doesn't make much

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:38,120
sense if it's only me so I started

00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:40,010
growing a bit of a group around me and

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,310
found open source design which was

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,099
another group and we kind of like

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,860
created a thing where people would

00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,739
request design and even like actually

00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,450
dock from openSUSE requested some

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:56,750
designs that open source design as well

00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,980
and we actually try to help those people

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:04,370
and yeah I talked a bit about Mozilla

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:06,620
tech speakers so if you are interested

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,360
in public speaking it's a volunteer

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,989
program so I don't work for Mozilla I'm

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,690
just a volunteer just and you get a

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,380
little bit of training to to speak at

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:23,329
public conferences and talk about

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,519
technically related projects so it is

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,850
why it has been quite nice because we

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,109
got to know quite a lot of people and

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,579
I've been a tech speaker for the reading

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:36,170
us now but not so important to that it's

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,100
mostly about the question I wanted to

00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,690
ask today about the importance of

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,819
software if you write good software

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,590
actually which is like the case for a

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,049
lot of open source projects and open

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,380
source software and there is no one else

00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:55,250
to use it because it doesn't have any

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:58,720
outreach does it really exist in some

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,239
kind of sense as with a forest

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,730
parallelism so if you have good software

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,040
but no one knows about it is it worth it

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,870
and I think that's quite a related as

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,989
well to to the reputation about

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,750
marketing and design B because in open

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:18,039
source projects marketing is seen as a

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:21,289
bad thing about people doing decisions

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:26,389
developers don't like people don't like

00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:28,460
and it's quite often zina the opposite

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:31,280
of the spectrum where we push marketing

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,080
all out of the project and like all

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,490
people are doing things from

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,870
grass roots with probably knowledge they

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:44,270
lack so many well written software in

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:49,909
open source actually don't get so much

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:52,460
exposure because of that reason so

00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:55,960
having said that we were thinking about

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,150
how you can solve one of the problems

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,620
related to that is that developers and

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,930
designers have a hard time working

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:10,659
together mostly because of how their

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:13,159
brains are wired quite differently and

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:16,310
so designers think visually and

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,050
programmers of course in a different way

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,590
I'm not a programmer so I cannot talk

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:25,639
for for for developers and but but I

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:29,389
actually thought that SVG as a format is

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:33,789
quite interesting because from from the

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:36,560
code side it's actually XML based so any

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,979
web developer comes across it at some

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
point

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,830
but also from the design side it's back

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,659
to base so if you are a designer you can

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,440
actually even Adobe Illustrator or

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:51,169
Inkscape you can export to SVG so it's

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:56,990
this common ground which works ball

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:59,210
works well for both both sides and this

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,440
is actually the main idea we had about

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:06,860
our homes open source project ident here

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,289
so a lot of projects asked me ask people

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,849
hey can you send me that logo and I need

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,819
Litton that resolution

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:18,919
I need that asset in that resolution SVG

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:20,990
whatever seemed like a RGB and it got

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,509
really tiresome at some point especially

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,139
when you're working with journalists we

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:30,050
want to use talk about your project and

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:32,949
you gotta send all the zips around to

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:37,129
satisfy everyone and we thought why not

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:40,039
create a platform which can do this for

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,649
you basically so that was the idea about

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:46,459
identity up where you can have all your

00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,820
assets colors fonts photos images in one

00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:50,210
place

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,520
and you basically upload one SVG for an

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,700
asset and it gets converted

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,470
automatically to other formats and

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,800
people can actually choose themselves

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,400
what they need this makes it quite

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,090
easier for non designers to get involved

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,650
and get everything they need so actually

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,130
I don't want to talk too much about that

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:16,430
I just wanted to show you how it works

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,210
in real time show you a quick live demo

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,990
and this is no weird because this is for

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:27,080
two three okay

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,930
so you can go to identity update Co and

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,910
we currently have a live demo which is

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:38,630
quite alpha but works so once you have

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:42,080
an account created you can easily create

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:58,120
projects come on internet don't let me

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:58,120
down okay the Internet is letting down

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:10,020
it worked a bit before yeah they always

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,630
say

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:17,730
try live demos often before and it never

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,230
works okay this is the bad news it's not

00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,000
the internet it's not working the good

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,610
news is that we're gonna have a workshop

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,660
today later around 4:00 I think and it's

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,310
gonna be a quite longer workshop so we

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,810
can go through all that all those things

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:36,030
later on and you basically can create

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,730
your if you have our examples of the

00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,070
open SUSE project you can create you can

00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:43,680
put all the logos all files all visuals

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,810
installations in one place and people

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,240
can grab whatever they need in whatever

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,670
format they need this also works pretty

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,270
well for a style guy so when you

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,820
actually work with developers who have

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,310
not a great idea how to use the visuals

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,580
of your project you can just link them

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,950
to the page I get they can see oh okay

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:10,290
this is how you're gonna use that on the

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,980
technical side identity app is free

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:16,230
software

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,880
it's a GPL licensed so some people might

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,510
not like that but it's written in

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,690
laravel PHP in the back back-end and

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:28,950
react in the front-end we are hoping

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:33,420
very soon to to do that

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,840
front-end displaying the front end and

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,760
on the server so you can use it also

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,940
without JavaScript enabled in tor

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,390
browser or it's similar as well so if

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,330
you want to contribute it's on github

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:53,880
many issues are open we currently have

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:56,430
also a bit off this is funny we

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,380
currently also have a bit of most

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,380
developers being involved so we can

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,450
mentor and even have some budget for

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,800
some stuff so if you're interested to

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:10,410
help feel free to let us know it's also

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,530
self hosted bull so the thing we want to

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,210
do is that you can actually make me

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,100
great from our platform to your own

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,930
platform so you can just install

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,870
identity app on your own server and when

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,610
you are not happy with your system

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,590
administrator or what

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,450
you can just get all your data and move

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:32,580
somewhere else and related to this is

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,870
also the main aspect we are working on

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,280
right now which is not currently

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,890
available but it's gonna be the main

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,410
feature of developers and designers

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,330
working together is to have a good

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,940
integration of identi up

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,970
so basically designers can use identity

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,460
app as a front-end and in the backend it

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:56,880
gets all the assets get synced to a get

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,940
repo so whenever you do a change it

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,060
translate into a get comment which gets

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,850
pushed to a git repo so developers who

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,010
actually prefer to use git can get all

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,220
the assets in a get three PO it's

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:15,480
basically the visuals will be SVG's the

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:19,320
colors will be Inkscape color swatches

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,270
or just text files and the photos will

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,320
be just the biggest resolution of photos

00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:28,070
available so this creates a nice balance

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,500
between working on the same project

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:33,530
developers using one tool designers

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,910
using the other tool but it's ultimately

00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:40,980
this same master tool let's say and this

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:44,400
is one future currently right now in the

00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:48,300
works and yeah if people are interested

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,580
to to help on that just let us know and

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,300
we'll be in the workshop later on to

00:11:50,580 --> 00:12:00,000
talk about this in a more slow pace

00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:02,250
manner as well so yeah I hope SVG can

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,140
bring designers and developers a bit

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,140
closer together and make it a bit easier

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,950
to push for better design and open

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,839
source as well if you have any questions

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:17,360
just let me know also in the hallway

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,360
I'll be all around all the day thank you

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,210
[Applause]

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:43,710
yeah that's a good question so once once

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:47,040
this table is released there will be

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:51,380
three plans for basic basic number of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:55,110
assets so for example for 20 assets and

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,880
well it's self host of all software so

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,530
you can hosted on your own server always

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,900
for free but it's in a same manner as

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,240
this course so our software we don't

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,680
want our self for it to be open core we

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,550
want it to be the same software you

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:18,510
would install so no code difference on

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:22,140
that side we might to special offers

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:29,820
let's say for open-source projects to to

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:34,470
sponsor them but yeah cool we are two

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,540
minutes early yeah I think my workshop

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,930
is one at 4:00 you can check out the

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,140
schedule today so if you want to learn

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:46,530
more or ask more questions or get your

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,750
hands dirty and create create a page

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:53,030
with actual internet connection we can

00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,030
do that as well later on thank you

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,339
