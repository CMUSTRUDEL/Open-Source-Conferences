Description: 
	The designer version control of the future?

SVG is magical when you think about it. It's one of the few formats both developers and designers can interact with. With the rise of SVG compatibility on the web, the format has enjoyed various new use cases with the HTML5 specification. Could it be used as a common file format both designers and developers can collaborate together? As SVG is basically just lines of code, shouldn't designers benefit from this vizualised version control without going through the painful git learning process? SVG could be the meeting point for version control powered by git, both suitable for developers but also designers. Let's talk about how this could look like with Free Open Source Software like Identihub, a potential frontend for version controlling visual assets in the future.
