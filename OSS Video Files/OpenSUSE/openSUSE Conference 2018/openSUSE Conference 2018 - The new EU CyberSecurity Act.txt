Or how to prevent the EU from becoming the worlds largest botnet honeypot

Fibre to the home opens numerous interesting possibilities for both bona-fide and not so bona-fide use cases.
Having your espresso machine or refrigerator being part of a multi-million device botnet which is attacking critical infrastructure might not necessarily be your first association when zipping your early morning caffeine fix.
Not only might this notion be somewhat disruptive for your early morning zen-moment, you might also be held legally accountable for these actions as it is actually your home network participating in an international attack wreaking havoc on, let’s say, the healthcare information system of a close NATO ally.
Nowadays there is zero quality control being enforced over internet connected devices in general. But the EU (and US) have decided this somewhat naive approach should come to an end.

A new directive (NIS, Directive on the Security of Network and Information Systems) comes into effect. Especially for branches active in the development of internet connected devices with a direct application in the “quality of life improvement” domain, this will be something to look out for:
Medical devices
Automotive
Domotica

This new directive includes the ambition of implementing a certification scheme for IT systems and devices, this scheme will be based on the existing ISO 15408 standard:

“ISO/IEC 15408-1:2009 establishes the general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and specifies the general model of evaluation given by various parts of ISO/IEC 15408 which in its entirety is meant to be used as the basis for evaluation of security properties of IT products.”

What does this standard encompass? What does open-source and free software have to do with this?

Let’s have a closer look in this talk!

it'll still fit you for being here thank

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,840
you for indulging me to ramble for 45

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,730
minutes about laws and legislation and

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,609
even thank you for pretending to be

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,720
interested in that very nice of you to

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:32,369
be here so before I start I want to take

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,980
a moment of especially my gratitude to

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,430
was the organizers of this awesome

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,739
conference and as a conference organizer

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,129
myself I actually was posed at need for

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,280
openSUSE conference 2015 in The Hague I

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,070
know how much blood sweat and tears

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
literally blows into this kind of thing

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,829
so first thing I had if there is anyone

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,780
from the organization here then they'll

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,730
hear it and if not Douglas is on video

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,609
please give the organisation of this

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,110
conference a round of applause and this

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,820
also was a test to see if you were

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:12,930
listening and the wave thank you so

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,250
let's move on them so Who am I my name

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,530
is Ron Stella's it's not rubbing

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,960
adversely that's a typo in my slides

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,530
Robin is a very good friend of mine um

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,939
and we do presentations together so

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:29,159
that's why I is then turns up here

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:33,930
I'm Hans I'm I've been working in I see

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,720
and I see security for about 20 years by

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,600
now so yes I'm that old

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,030
my Turbots of my childhood areas of

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:48,630
business are primarily heavily regulated

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,990
environments like performance medical

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,329
and health care institutions the type of

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,780
business that whenever something goes

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,990
wrong either somebody's has to pay a lot

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,159
of money or someone and this I find

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:07,320
personally much more as father or

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,479
someone gets hurt because especially in

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,150
health care information

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,710
integrity confidentiality and

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,160
availability is literally

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:20,600
but is the difference between what can

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,000
be the difference between life and death

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:28,290
to hit the atmosphere a bit lighter than

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,470
life and death I also do other stuff I

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,020
organize for a circle concerts I have a

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,440
press 8 mercedes-benz and I wrote my own

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,860
wine grapes because everyone needs a

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,190
hobby

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,280
but let's not ramble on too much about

00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:49,430
me why are we here why are we here in

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:55,530
this room there is a paradigm change

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:59,610
going on in European law we are moving

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:03,210
from a construction where laws are

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:06,840
typically descriptions of what you are

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:13,080
not allowed to do tools models that

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:19,790
outline general guidances of compliance

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:24,050
and general methodology methodology to

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:27,180
implement measures to mitigate with

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:32,910
weather that comes from what we are in

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:39,030
an era of change our current times no

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:41,880
longer allow for lawmakers to be overly

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,820
specific when it comes to suits and

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,190
technologies when it comes to certain

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:51,060
economic models when it comes to well

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,420
basically anything that was an unmovable

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,900
truth almost 20 years ago I now has

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,140
become moving and especially as the

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,350
world somehow appears to be bigger than

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,400
Western or Eastern Europe you need to

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,160
implement laws and regulations that are

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:15,120
not only clothes really applicable

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:20,040
within a certain continental realm but

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:24,479
can be used as a global Universal type

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,009
of methodology so but first

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,990
let's make sure that we talk about the

00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:32,740
same thing here because I'm going to

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:38,800
talk about cyber stuff and so what is

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:44,979
cyber cyber is literally nothing cyber

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:48,449
is coming from the Absinthe brief term

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:51,759
which means being able to basically

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,389
control push or it makes something

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,510
happen so how does that relate to

00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:01,180
cybercrime cyber sex and other types of

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,160
ciphers that we have nowadays helped

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,610
through all the ciphers it doesn't mean

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,070
anything but it does mean however is

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,669
that somehow a lot of people seem to

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,370
think that it actually means something

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,139
so because a lot of people think that it

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,510
actually means something under them to

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,070
pretend that I am one of those people

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,650
who actually think it means something

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,729
because else it would take me too much

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:31,240
time to move out let out all of those

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,820
cyber references then come up with

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,430
another marketing term for this whole

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:44,440
container thing somewhere this is come

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,460
from or what these were does the cyber

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,639
security strategy that we now see

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:55,080
developing brothers that come from a

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:58,229
couple of things first of all laws and

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:03,690
technologies don't necessarily

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:06,750
complement each other and just like well

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:10,510
maybe this is a bit of a stretch but

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,630
open source software and economic

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,780
business models they're also not

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:20,470
entirely directly related they tend to

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,400
exist perfectly happy in each other's

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:27,699
sincerity yet being able to sell

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,310
something that is free kind of life is a

00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,830
contradiction in terms but you need to

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,120
do when you want to sell something that

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,720
is free as you have to focus on this

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:44,460
around that particular aspect and then

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:49,070
you have to come up with methodologies

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:52,320
and procedures and with value-added

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:55,110
regulations to ensure that's the

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,479
component that you're selling even

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,840
though it is free becomes economically

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,750
attractive from a different perspective

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,699
and that is actually what the

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:11,210
cybersecurity strategy is all about

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:15,419
because cyber civility is a term is a

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:21,150
concept that is a meaningless the

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:24,979
undefinable and say well as they even as

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:29,310
she necessary but what is valuable is

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,220
information what is valuable is the raw

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,850
data from the raw data we create

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:40,639
information by correlating raw data in

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:43,320
two entities relations but not from

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,310
information we create knowledge and

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,639
based on this knowledge we take

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,370
decisions as a society believe it or not

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:59,580
even politicians tend to think that our

00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:04,349
influence by actual knowledge among of

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:09,270
the things that I see happening nowadays

00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:14,210
is that although this is may be hard to

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:18,620
believe nowadays laws actually go above

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:22,560
technology and yes of course there is

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,310
technological opportunity to keep

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,960
certain information out of the realm of

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,990
authorities for instance influences

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,950
communication ensures that you are able

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,120
to communicate with other people without

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:41,610
government intercepting your

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:46,080
communication yet still if a law in a

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:48,840
country decides these defines that

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,550
some points in the judicial system you

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,850
should be able the government should be

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,110
able to branch into your systems from

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,080
Sir Francis be damned

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,690
well that will happen luckily we are in

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,940
Europe and Europe has at least since

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:07,800
about seventy five years ago pretty

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:10,110
Lautrec reference of keeping privacy or

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,870
a citizens privacy as one of its core

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,210
competences and I know when I'm saying

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,320
that and and where I'm standing right

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:22,200
now thirty years ago in this particular

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,450
City for instance that type of liberty

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,990
and that type of privacy was not yet

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:33,930
taken for granted so privacy and laws

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,840
and technology are that let's say

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:41,220
interesting the not entirely compatible

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:44,570
concepts let but you see is nowadays I

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,450
don't know who has seen Mark Zuckerberg

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,950
testify that were promote himself in

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,190
front of the European Parliament

00:09:49,950 --> 00:10:01,410
recently who has seen those couple

00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:02,880
people not meet you and so so what I

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,390
found interesting there is not

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,280
necessarily the whole marketing show and

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,250
all surface that was brought up around

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,320
that but what I found interesting is the

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,570
actual fact that the European Parliament

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,190
fall the MAL over to Western him and

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:22,890
what I also found interesting is the

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,650
response of several of the parties in

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,170
the European Parliament as in that they

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,300
have been profoundly dissatisfied with

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,130
the level of answering that circle of

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,880
providers and that they will follow up

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:39,420
so that is interesting from a point of

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,550
view that you now see politicians not

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:46,140
only taking an interest but also

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:48,920
seemingly taking responsibility to gain

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,390
the knowledge needed to actually

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,649
understand the concepts and do something

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:57,490
with it or that's the same thing that's

00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:02,180
or has been happening actually on a

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:10,370
cybersecurity around since about the

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:14,060
early 2000s when we had the first more

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:18,320
or less globally accepted certification

00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:21,380
evaluation scheme for IT security

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,110
related audits and assessments the

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,920
common criteria that was around 2000

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,320
that has been devised and updated in

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,910
2014 and that's basically what we're

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,370
going to talk about now but still what

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:39,730
we see in the European Union same as

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:43,220
Vista GPR before the GDP our countries

00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,779
provided information security and

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,529
information with privacy information

00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:50,990
Jersey as being a national thing somehow

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,470
with the premonition that the internet

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,940
would stop at their borders and that

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,490
parties wanting to exchange in

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:02,390
international trade or international

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:06,260
data sharing or exchange would gladly

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:08,600
implement geofencing or workers to do

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,260
that well that somehow massively didn't

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,870
happen and especially companies like

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:18,500
Google Facebook where the usual basic

00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,949
space they are not going to you have to

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,190
do the process as a continent I would

00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:29,170
say and what we see nowadays is on the

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:32,990
cybersecurity approaches there is a very

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,360
nationally focused approach so what will

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,579
happen now is that the European

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,250
Commission is drawing up a new

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:43,819
regulation towards a harmonized model

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,880
for information security cyber security

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,949
incident response training education and

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,730
what not but what I found the most

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:56,240
interesting goal and objective in this

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,610
is among the life line here and

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,010
especially the latter one is it is the

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:05,820
explicit goal of this regulation to

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,630
ensure transparency

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,630
of cybersecurity assurance and assurance

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,980
means being able to validate and

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:20,010
evaluate if a security measure or

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,750
Control has actually been implemented in

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:27,470
any way that ensures its effectiveness

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,180
the first well assurances without

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,030
control that's basically but the

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,830
religious domain is all about and that's

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:43,140
for instance in the cybersecurity domain

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:46,380
stay out of the religious domain and the

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:50,450
other thing and this I mentioned briefly

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:55,170
before is we are going from a model

00:13:50,450 --> 00:14:00,200
where Louis dictates what is forbidden

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:04,410
to a model where laws creates a

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,200
compliance realm or compliance domain in

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:11,100
which as a company or individual you

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,410
have done to perform proper risk

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,500
management and impact assessments to

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:21,150
improve your compliance with that

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,490
specific legal domain and I would say

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:28,500
that this is an enormous plus because

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:32,490
before we had compliance with IT

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,080
security laws will be in placed under

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:39,750
the legal departments of companies and

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:44,490
well I mean a lot of my friends are

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:47,640
lawyers and yes they are and but their

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,970
primary confidence area doesn't

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,580
necessarily lay in the IT realm their

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,510
primary competence area meet is

00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,180
primarily in the business of explaining

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:02,250
no matter what is the reality that there

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,440
are somehow compliance to whatever

00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:08,400
alternative reality is being described

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,760
by the law so what happens now and that

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,470
is the same thing with the gdpr

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:18,840
for instance is gdpr is an open itu-t

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:23,820
dpi is also not and

00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:26,910
we're a compliance department law gdpr

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:31,050
requires you to implement information

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:34,620
resonance information models in it

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:37,280
provides you to come up with in from

00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:40,050
personal information registration

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,740
administration with interface

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,110
descriptions and whatnot it actually

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,470
requires you as a business to implement

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,630
proper information architecture so how

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,140
does information architecture governance

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,270
relates to legal compliance of these two

00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:04,640
the lawyer side of legal compliance

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:07,800
well it doesn't because it just doesn't

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,480
so there are areas of business in which

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,500
we've been doing this for quite some

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:18,670
time especially in the health realm

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,050
and when you look at medicine

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,840
manufacturing for instance in the early

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,860
20th century there were a lot of

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,350
medicines against flu and against

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:33,260
pneumonia and essentially what these

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,870
medicines did was not exactly clear the

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,180
disease but they made you die very happy

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,730
because they were primarily they made

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,710
out of morphine and alcohol which is

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,500
awesome which makes you really well

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,570
mostly but still die so what happens in

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,360
the early 20th century in the healthcare

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:54,770
realm was that they implemented laws

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:58,460
requiring the so called subsidiarity

00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:01,250
principle this is a legal transfers

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,620
which says whatever you claim to be

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,600
effective towards something must

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,839
actually be proven to be effective

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,790
towards that something so the medical

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,140
industry went like now we actually

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,300
have to come up with something that

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,199
works and that took them about a hundred

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,610
years and then they started to implement

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,990
medical devices to help out like

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:26,689
pacemakers in insulin pumps and

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,640
artificial lungs and stuff and well with

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,140
those instruments it also helps us to

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,200
actually do what they're supposed to do

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,750
and not necessarily create cardiac

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,180
arrests and whatnot but now we have this

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,520
new reality with the networked

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,160
environment in healthcare which also

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,600
requires space night as to be well

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,990
someone's protected from let's say happy

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,640
him because well what's more easy for an

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:57,410
assassin do you feel it's more easy to

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,360
go into the brush or something that from

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,450
a kilometers distance and have a big

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,280
giant sniper rifle and then hoping that

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,110
with the wind and the angles never seen

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,240
you're able to hit your target or it

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,180
doesn't look more easy to simply walk

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,210
towards his house had his Wi-Fi overload

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,320
his insulin pump and kill him like that

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,890
personally I would prefer the latter

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,380
but this implements or at least least

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,540
requires the implementation of this

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,880
management which means that you first

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,000
have to know what the best are of the

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,070
projects that you

00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,800
trying to defend then come up with

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,020
requirements to me retro Swiss then

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,220
implement those requirements and then

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,560
actually test but those implementers

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:44,070
requirements are indeed effective

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,040
rewards but to Atlanta protects so in

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,050
the IT boom this is something like the

00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,600
v-model there's different models but

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:57,480
this one is a fairly common but so then

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,960
I said data general desert protection

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,570
regulation uses the same principle no

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,780
but you have on the information science

00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:09,270
no whoever is using or a process in the

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,200
information and if you know those fields

00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,740
it's very easy

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,040
at least it's more or less doable to

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,280
provide the data owner with the lights

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:24,960
right access and portability or to

00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,540
demand a glacier and the nice thing

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,080
about the GDP as well and this is I mean

00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,760
there's hope if you hear this then the

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,760
whole power to the people premonition of

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,270
the GDP are that might suggest that the

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,170
GDP are is a anti company law but it

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,990
isn't because companies now for the

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,290
first time in history have one single go

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,030
to points providing information the

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,090
personal information security related

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:57,600
stuff in the entire you instead of the

00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,880
27 other pretty much disagreeing little

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,130
parties which implemented a long version

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,230
of this reality thank God you've a

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,490
Roadhouse because now it's one less but

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,840
still the model is not very scalable

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,510
suburban out coming up within the EU

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,310
cybersecurity to them is a you want

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,390
confidence network and of imbalance

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:22,800
networks establishments at first are

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:26,400
creating a common vocabulary because if

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,430
you don't agree that you actually speak

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,370
the same language then it's very hard to

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,260
even agree about anything else and the

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,900
same language doesn't necessarily mean

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,400
the same linguistic language like the

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,300
spoken language English or what

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:47,670
but come up with definitions we're

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:50,830
running hope target measures

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:54,400
applicability and whatnot and this is

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:57,670
something that's actually interesting

00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,340
because the the individual computer

00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,410
emergency response agencies within the

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,660
member states they used to all have a

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,590
different definition of what is an IT

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,000
incident a nightly incident in the

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,280
Netherlands for instance if you are

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,670
aware that the Netherlands is basically

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:19,450
this swampy area surrounded by water

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:22,090
which mainly lays around 3 meters below

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,600
sea level in my house in the hail is

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:27,760
four enough meters below sea level in

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,010
the Netherlands a major I see the

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,890
incident would be not being able to

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:37,240
reach the bottle level management

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:39,250
facilities in my area yet that type of

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,100
IT related incident might not be the

00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,910
same in let's say Austria in the Alps

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,980
for reasons of not being under water so

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:51,690
first we have to come up with a level

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,670
vocabulary and then we have to upgrade I

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:57,700
deliberately don't say updates because

00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:01,840
we are taking a live here we need to

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:06,750
operate security in education the

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:10,390
example given here at the SP bit of crap

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,610
literally comes from an IC course from

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,240
the use of University of Applied Science

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:18,160
in the Netherlands this is not unique

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,050
for the Netherlands and in any of you

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,540
who who which PHP will know instantly

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,340
what's wrong with it other than having a

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,290
couple of Falls here and there but those

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:31,570
are my typos but the general principle

00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:33,370
is let's say input validation so and in

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,100
the past base and this is really nice

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,970
the national news agencies in the

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,690
Netherlands have has over 15 major news

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:48,730
items about IT forces doing crap like

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:51,100
this which being an IT services teacher

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,830
for several universities and London's

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,159
that makes my job security

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,080
better for now but still we have to

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,169
update on this so the focus for the next

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,299
two years which is coincidentally also

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:06,330
the timeline for the implementation for

00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:09,140
the new EU cybersecurity Act will be to

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:12,809
create at least some sense of security

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,519
in education as well so we have building

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,710
block number one creates a common

00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,360
vocabulary building block number to make

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,460
sure that we educate people to actually

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,909
know but they're talking about and even

00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,309
better

00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:25,860
first we educate the teachers so that

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:28,039
they are able to educate pupils threat

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:34,740
you know what they are talking about and

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:37,470
then we go into it certification and the

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:41,519
certification hooks into the concept of

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:45,360
the whole transparency aspect so how can

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:48,690
you give people the tools to actually

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,720
assess whether if the product that they

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:55,320
are using is in some way faithful

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,269
purpose including the security question

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,440
so you come up with certification

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:05,429
naturally but certification has a pretty

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,960
bad reputation especially if you look at

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:12,059
and commercial IT certification realms

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,350
like certified so filled by Norton

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,519
AntiVirus

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,809
this email is certified secured by

00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,610
prosperity yet the Russian Secret

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:24,330
Service is listening via solar but we

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:26,730
don't tell a monster so what is you

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,029
first then have to come up with what

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,010
your process of certification or

00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:36,419
evaluation towards certification would

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:38,250
then be and lovely the beauty about

00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:42,120
standards and norms is that you have so

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:46,230
many to choose from we have the ISO 50

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,700
for late 15 Foley which is evaluation

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:53,340
with area 40 which happens to be the

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:57,570
norm that basically the Western balls

00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,679
around 2000 adopted already as the

00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,730
Common Criteria

00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:06,090
already the 15400 rate is the norm which

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,370
allows you to evaluate if some party has

00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:18,360
implemented those Common Criteria

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:22,289
correctly and it is actually both as

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:26,820
useful advice for developers as well as

00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,919
for customer I'm sorry on the turbo

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,750
graphx circuit switching off and on my

00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:36,059
microphones it's fine prevent you from

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:39,649
being blasted away by the coffin so if I

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:44,460
had some points forget please forgive me

00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:47,399
so when you introduce a concept in law

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,039
and then you say it's voluntary that

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:54,270
usually causes some kind of friction

00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,649
because voluntary roles that kind of is

00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,169
a contradiction in terms

00:25:55,649 --> 00:26:00,809
so what they've built in in this

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:04,890
particular realm is that they have a

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:09,149
compiled or explained principle which

00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:11,580
means that you either adopt this one all

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:13,409
right you have to explain for every

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,940
little things I needed services in the

00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:19,470
bloody room and those are a lot of pages

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,840
why you don't comply and thereby making

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:28,440
it effectively easier to do comply to

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:33,779
the norm than to explain by alert so I'm

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,390
going to go over the items of the ISO 15

00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:40,590
for always but I should invite also that

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:43,320
this is a norm that is free to download

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,090
free as in beer although I wouldn't

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,279
recommend being in the norm whilst

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,799
drinking beer because it is quite a

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,559
complex norm and you have like this to

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,779
the Brahma optimum of intoxication

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,120
versus information processing and that

00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,679
tends to go south quite easy if you look

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,970
at Windows Vista we all know what that

00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,740
means so I will go over the norm but you

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,450
are able to download it yourself from

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:13,110
the ISO website and it is if you're used

00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:15,390
to reading technical requirements

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,000
specifications organization it's a

00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,620
surprisingly divisible and practical

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,610
norm

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:27,470
it's big is a couple of hundred pages a4

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:29,750
size information but that is not because

00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,150
it's so complex it's just because it it

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:35,390
covers an immense amount of topics and

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:38,029
so I was kinda surface here so that you

00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:41,659
have least have some clue as to the

00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:43,730
scope and coverage of this norm but I

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,190
would highly recommend you to download

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,400
at least part one which is the general

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,200
model and introduction and that gives

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,279
you the impression of the scope and the

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,100
idea in which this norm is applicable

00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:03,320
because then this will be a voluntary

00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:05,750
long soon yeah so if you want to be able

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,390
to market any kind of isolated system or

00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,039
IOT related system in any kind of

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,890
weather wise environments that whole

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:17,600
concept of voluntary men not be entirely

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,080
applicable so we have this concept

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,440
called

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,870
target of evaluation that's the

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,110
beginning and the target of evaluation

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,760
is not necessarily a single system is it

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:34,880
is what we in the architecture domain

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,730
refer to as an information domain and an

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,210
information domain is one or more

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:44,450
systems or applications or parts of

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:49,149
systems or applications that work with

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:52,370
certain related information entities and

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:55,520
are being used in a certain type of

00:28:52,370 --> 00:29:00,350
functionality for instance eight are

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:03,740
departments if you would consider the HR

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:07,700
process to be the target of evaluation

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,510
that would consist of both the HR bad

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,460
situation

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,289
with the names and addresses and dates

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,720
of birth and whatnot

00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:17,059
it would also include the financial

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,210
processing information because for some

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:22,940
reason and please wants to be paid so if

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,370
at least they don't work for free or

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,929
voluntary and you have a finance rate

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,680
legislation you should consider that

00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:32,850
under the information domain

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,360
so I hope that's clear information

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:39,500
domain does not mean single application

00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,590
sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:47,280
but this makes the concept a bit hard

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:50,340
from a vendor perspective I would even

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,790
say almost impossible from a vendor

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:56,520
perspective to claim that your

00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:01,350
application single application is always

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:03,690
from clients to chroma criteria or ISO

00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,900
15 for red because from my point of view

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:09,720
and I will give an example later on and

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,720
the only type of application does

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,960
actually system that's actually suitable

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,730
to be an information domain by itself is

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,200
an operating system because that is a

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,530
low-level single purpose

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,520
mostly type of thing to ensure that it

00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:31,580
serves other things and we'll go into

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,470
that later but for instance SUSE Linux

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,980
this is the latest enterprise forever

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,390
has been certified by the bundes on

00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,650
physical Heights and information

00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:45,150
technique which is determinate NSA SUSE

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:49,680
Linux Enterprise Server has been

00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:53,580
certified for ISO 15 for always purpose

00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,980
as being an target of evaluation by

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:59,460
itself so this is a concept this is just

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,070
internalized and and probably the list

00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,740
of whatever type of thing might be

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,750
considered to be a target of in

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,880
celebration and the term of evaluation

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:17,040
can also be a process so terms will

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:22,040
evaluation are also combinations of

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:26,210
different acids and acid can be systems

00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,190
documentation personnel even and

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,980
especially IT systems as they are

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:37,080
configurable they might in some

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:40,230
configurations not be suitable for usage

00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,850
in such a high highly regulated

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,460
environment if you don't implement

00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:47,000
proper

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:49,669
it was a little sore at armor or to name

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,559
just a couple of simple things then it

00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:54,260
might be that that particular

00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:58,970
configuration is not applicable to be a

00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:01,760
target of evaluation but still just

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,279
accept this as being reality so the

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,909
turret audiences for the 15 for radar

00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:11,899
consumers the consumers can define

00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:15,289
requirements what they would need from a

00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:17,809
security perspective in a Tyrell of

00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:20,149
evaluation or a system and that's called

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:23,210
a protection profile so a protection

00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:26,330
profile could be I have a firewall and

00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,190
that should prevent stuff from going in

00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,970
and out of my network without me

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,409
explicitly telling anyone to do so

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:38,299
developers on the other hand they

00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:39,909
develop the Seleucid target which is

00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:44,049
supposed to be protected by the

00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:47,270
protection profile so system toilets

00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:49,250
targets the system protection profile

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,649
the performance of anything you want to

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,140
impose on that system and then you have

00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:56,210
the evaluators which have the fun job of

00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,289
poking around to see if the projection

00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:02,149
perform is actually sufficient for the

00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:06,830
target and then you have the rest of the

00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:09,380
world so part one like I said is

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,350
actually quite beautiful it goes over

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,510
how to come up with security

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,659
requirements so the process of

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:20,899
requirements elicitation specification

00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:22,850
and validation how to create protection

00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,990
profiles and packages of profiles

00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:29,179
because you can reuse profiles across

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:31,190
different targets for valuation which

00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:34,220
have the same power family if you create

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:37,279
a profile for a firewall a then you can

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:40,850
probably reuse that profile for pharma B

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,669
and that's entirely legitimate online

00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:49,010
chapter 9 or cross-line in ISO

00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:50,809
terminology is on how to how to handle

00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:54,230
evaluation missiles and then we have a

00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:56,050
couple of Alexis but go into detail of

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,240
holidays

00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:02,370
so Chapter seven how to come up with

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,730
requirements how to define them how to

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:09,820
create a terminology and use the terms

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,520
appropriately for the requirements

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,210
chapter eight come up with profiles and

00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,580
packages and here again the the example

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:22,120
of firewall for instance I have an IP

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,820
tables firewall and that should do

00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,220
whatever every other firewall to do as

00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,190
well so then I have a protection program

00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,500
for a firewall and the security target

00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:38,140
in this instance will be the IP tables

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:39,899
firewall and then we have the evaluated

00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:44,050
results and the nice thing about that is

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:47,050
the purpose of the common criteria is

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:51,790
not only to evaluate but also to

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:55,630
communicate those results so for

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:59,560
instance the susan validation SUSE Linux

00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:02,410
Enterprise Server validation that is the

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,410
result of that the report is online in

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,510
its infancy so you can access the report

00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,330
and see houses are prepared itself for

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,300
the certification process you can also

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:18,370
see which parts they included in it and

00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:19,810
which parts they didn't so the scope of

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,500
part one is mainly background

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,080
information

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,600
part two is towards what kind of

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,090
requirements do we have and part three

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,550
is what kind of assurances can we

00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:34,540
implement so that the requirements are

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:36,640
met so then you look at asset and

00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:41,190
environment and anyone who's familiar

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,930
with IT security especially ISO 27001

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,570
will have heard about the concept of

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:49,240
asset and environment because an asset

00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:52,180
is something you want to protect the

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,550
environment is somewhere you want to

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,310
protect the asset in and then you create

00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:01,570
a risk profile of all the base that the

00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:03,100
asset might be exposed to within the

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,710
environment the lasas friendly

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,970
everything even I send me an asset if I

00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,599
want to be as

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,589
I see for my own company I am an asset

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,150
the rest of the world might feel

00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:17,950
differently by the way that's their

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:20,920
freedom so if you fell into from

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,319
September lationship an owner wants to

00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,119
protect assets

00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:29,050
we'll take countermeasures to middle

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:31,510
eyes with a threat agents will try to

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,119
impose those lists on the same assets

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:38,980
and that's how it all ties together so

00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,880
Lee Hom idea of the ISO 15 for Ray is to

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,069
demonstrate applicability

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,430
appropriateness subsidiarity if you will

00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:50,440
effectiveness to define the fitness to

00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,380
the demonstrated fitness for purpose of

00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,260
the measures that you take on security

00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:59,020
so because if something is not

00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,910
interesting for you to consider to be a

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,210
risk then you don't have to do anything

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,990
against it so the whole process of risk

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,630
assessment is not just coming up with as

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,970
many hypothetical scenarios as possible

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:16,030
in which something things are wrong well

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:19,829
it must be in some way related to any

00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:23,740
reality that you feel yourself into so

00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:26,079
evaluation gives you confidence that the

00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:29,530
countermeasures that you take are

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:34,030
sufficient are correct to mitigate to

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:36,940
this that is exposing your asses so then

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:39,040
we have part 2 which goes into the

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,460
functional components and the

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:48,869
performance again I've just outlined the

00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:51,160
basic steps or the basic concepts here

00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:53,859
coming up with requirements through

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,550
words isolated targets creating a

00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:59,890
protection profile and it will create

00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:03,630
what's false security functional

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:06,310
requirement if you are an IT

00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,650
architecture students were as a student

00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:11,650
in general developer then evil knows

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:14,980
that security requirements are mostly

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:18,600
regarded as being non fractional with

00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,420
violence for instance the IAE nor

00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,090
surfer violent specification explicitly

00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,510
names security requirements to be

00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:30,450
non-functional requirements so what does

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,730
the ice our first info read me here they

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,330
mean that civility functional

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:39,540
requirements are basically the security

00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:42,900
access an authorization and effective

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,030
action measures built into a system will

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,100
into the target of evaluation so not

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:50,790
necessarily the security requirements

00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:53,430
only physical environment for the

00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,920
operational environment of let's say a

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,320
system administrator like I have to keep

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,270
my copies of the installation media

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,310
absolutely secret because else someone

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:05,220
else will steal them it means that this

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:12,810
is whatever you can compare inside a

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:18,570
system as being a curative measure and

00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:20,790
that means usually or processes so then

00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,790
you can come up with the policy and the

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:26,490
policy is the part where you link the

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:29,550
performance to the actual procedure in

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:32,790
which the system is used and then you

00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:35,040
combine them into thoroughly field rate

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,370
evaluation efforts officinalis lee which

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:43,200
is the matrix english site site together

00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:46,260
so the objects of relevance here as

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,880
usually users uses one to access

00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:54,060
information that information is being

00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,190
federalized in objects a user has a

00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,940
session invisible interact with the

00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:02,990
system and to facilitate that system

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,400
that session there will be resources

00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:11,180
available like this forever in network

00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:13,650
what not to facilitate that and then um

00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,240
within those concepts you will have

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,610
certain attributes for instance this

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,980
user has this profile disfluency

00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,140
clearance so therefore they know may

00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,470
have they may have this pole in the

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,720
system etc this basically sounds like a

00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,320
simple explanation of robust access

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,260
control

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:35,450
outlining because it's even not that

00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:39,200
much more in this model defines a

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:43,460
distinction between security

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,600
functionality data which is that's fine

00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,840
which consists of the user attributes

00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,410
which consists of access control and

00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:57,660
information attribute and use of data

00:40:52,410 --> 00:41:00,720
which basically is the the data of the

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:04,260
system itself so the workflow processing

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,400
data so security related data is

00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:12,390
metadata and the rest is system data so

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,850
bad to has the following chapters which

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:18,780
performance should be imposed on service

00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:22,130
others but can we audit communications

00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:25,619
does cryptography play a role in there

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:29,820
how do we protect the actual data of the

00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:32,960
system how do we go about identification

00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,520
an organization multiple factor

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,710
organization for instance what is our

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,390
security management scheme how do we

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:45,990
know about privacy etc etc and then we

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:48,420
have poetry but first we created all

00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:51,270
requirements the facility requirements

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:54,350
and part three of the norm goes into how

00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:58,290
can we then come up with assurances that

00:41:54,350 --> 00:42:02,640
provides the required level of certainty

00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:04,320
that we need and but you have to fill in

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,270
for mobility management because the

00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,460
thing that you are trying to prevent our

00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,940
vulnerabilities from being exploited and

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:15,090
for no abilities can come from a number

00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,640
of sources ie the requirements of a

00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:20,460
system has been so poorly described that

00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,060
the business process will not be able to

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,680
be facilitated that is a vulnerability

00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,590
development is performed poorly or the

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,240
operations of a system are not

00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,720
implemented correctly and therefore

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,760
leaving open all kinds of security holes

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,330
from the mobility management you can do

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,690
on a certain on certain levels you can

00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:43,740
either eliminate the vulnerability

00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,060
minimize the impacts of the

00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:50,070
vulnerability

00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:52,800
or monitor the vulnerability occurring

00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,570
so that you can then take action or by

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,300
the way and run through this quite fast

00:42:54,570 --> 00:43:00,600
but this lines will be online if anyone

00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,900
is interested and then how do you go

00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,060
about approaching evaluation but you can

00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,350
simply analyze a process and procedure

00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,880
you can do penetration testing you can

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,190
implement planning control cycles to

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,480
come up with it

00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:20,670
and then you determine what kind of

00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,250
assurance level that you need to adhere

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:25,680
to from a certain system for instance if

00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:29,670
you implement a healthcare related

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,920
system from start to finish you need to

00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,000
know what's going on there so you need

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,680
to come up with assurance requirements

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,920
describing in detail all the different

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,530
parts of the system and you have to

00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,400
choose a level that is appropriate for

00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:50,880
the target of evaluation that you want

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,580
to possess and in the last part for

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,040
instance let's say functioning festered

00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,500
means I have my senior user group

00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,840
working through all the procedures as

00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,760
soon as I have annuities structurally

00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:09,270
tested means I had automated testing

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:14,820
method methodically tested and test and

00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:18,510
lace is a formal process in which tests

00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:20,100
are being validators etc etc in the norm

00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,470
there are several of these matrixes

00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:26,790
coming into this and weapon up due to

00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:29,850
time this is the chapters and the

00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:32,460
clauses which are outlined in part 3 but

00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:36,720
if she'll inputs for that and as open

00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:39,690
source familiy I think this should start

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,460
preparing for this because this will be

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:46,500
what will be required from users that

00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:50,990
want to use our systems in the nearby

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:54,270
future so we think about coming up with

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:56,420
protection packages and protection

00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,550
profiles and maybe standardized

00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:01,820
community effort

00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:04,970
create such profiles because just as the

00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:08,600
GDP are free and open-source software

00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:10,460
are not developed in a vacuum they are

00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,750
developed in a virtualized environment

00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:16,040
but still they are we need to be

00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,560
law-abiding citizens

00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,660
so communities we need to starts because

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,320
we can also benefit from this because

00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:28,130
the open source being transparent means

00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:30,980
that we as part of our ecosystem can

00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:33,950
actually differently and brutally honest

00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,860
about what we do and this is a big plus

00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:39,830
for businesses leather actually be able

00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,850
to contribute back to us by means of

00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,970
those Federation packages just like the

00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:52,190
end-user now helps us with documentation

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:54,860
and testing and whatnot so if you have

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:58,250
time look into the youth face of Sousa

00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,780
it's on the website of Sousa they have a

00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:04,280
nice report of everything they've done

00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:07,760
to ascertain the situation and basically

00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,670
this was probably should do better as I

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,310
just outlined and I want to end with a

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:16,640
very happy picture because it is a very

00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:25,540
happy ending I would say and I'm even

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:28,910
from a long time so little away sweetie

00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,190
I'm not sure every time for questions or

00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:37,940
if you're even still able to formulate

00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:38,320
some questions just who dares I won't

00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,240
take

00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,310
found that I have been absolutely clear

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,180
on this topic and that you have been

00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:49,150
sufficiently informed so thank you very

00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:55,450
much for your presence and awareness

00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:57,100
here and I look forward to having some

00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:02,770
beers with you because that is actually

00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:05,220
- purposeful goal for today all right

00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,220
