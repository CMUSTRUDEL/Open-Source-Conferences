In the time of clouds and virtual computing it seems, there is no longer space for a large real-hardware-based OS deployments. But what schools use in their classrooms? What is beneath ATMs, info kiosks, cash registers? For there devices real network OS deployment is still crucial.
This talk is about exactly that. Well known network PXE boot, but upgraded with Salt, a modern configuration management engine, to automate and secure the process.
We will go from basic setup, through salt integration in netboot initrd and to salt states to make all of this possible and more.
