	00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:14,400
so I would like to introduce our keynote

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:20,750
speaker and he's the director of Souza

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:26,160
ABB's go ahead and say we had him set up

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:29,400
and and so we've talked we've talked

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,560
about bringing in the keynote speaker

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,930
having the conference here in Prague and

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,809
and of course he's right here

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,140
Sue's elapsed as the director and so

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:51,239
please welcome Vortech Havelock pavlok

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:53,760
Malik I'm quite grateful you managed my

00:00:51,239 --> 00:01:01,170
first thing right so that doesn't

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:07,439
usually happen well I got a HDMI yes

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:10,260
fine does the presentation so yes I was

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,450
actually asked to do a keynote and I had

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,330
doing key nuts because you know it's all

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,250
supposed to be witty and funny and and

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,970
all that and that's really hard

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,890
ah and I don't even know enough about

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,450
openSUSE in the community unfortunately

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,610
because I'm kind of a little bit from

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,000
the other side right I'm I definitely am

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,370
very much um a community guide because I

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,610
started as a kernel engineer in Sousa

00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,140
years ago actually we'll go there in in

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:44,100
my talk but I have not been involved in

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:48,030
the actual district much mainly coding

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:52,500
so um I thought well maybe I could talk

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,440
about how it all looks from the

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,030
enterprise side of things start yeah I'm

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,260
mainly involved in in my work and

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,299
hopefully it will be a little bit funny

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:10,019
at least so it all started as you all

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:14,879
know in 1992 Azusa was founded the

00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:16,680
chameleon looked the wrong way and the

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,750
thoughts were between the leathers and

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,110
all that and I actually I have to add

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,810
one thing and that is due to popular

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,730
demand by some of the organizers I need

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,860
to also say here

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,170
that on the founding of Sousa actually

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:38,549
happened in an Indian restaurant in a

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:41,010
lion now that was still way ahead of my

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:45,120
time at Sousa right so I joined only a

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,890
couple years later one-one manager from

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,989
Sousa actually knocked on my door in

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,190
Prague and asked well do you want to

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:55,049
work for Susan I said well what is it

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,610
and he said well we are linux company

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,370
and we would like you to do what you do

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,560
just will pay it for it you keep hacking

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,940
USB and we are fine so yes awesome

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:11,120
people that's good why not let's do that

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:16,079
and so I joined sue say 1999 and since I

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,870
was happiest be now and um it was kind

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,940
of research he stuff I thought okay I'll

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,140
call my work something and so I created

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,780
this banner yeah

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,390
Sue's elapses it's it's pixelated it's

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,709
like actually the projector doesn't show

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,750
it that badly but it's quite ugly

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,500
because all the word was pixelated back

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:40,799
then and that was about April and that

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,169
was May 99 when I created that banner

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,489
and and put it put up a web page on my

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,630
university computer

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,849
um and then a month later and watch few

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,579
months later in July actually that

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:56,340
announcement came out Suzy found suitor

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,519
labs uh I was like what

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,069
okay I'm already in there that's good

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,500
and it was all about how Sousa is

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,220
investing into Linux research and and

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,489
and very businessí our press

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,000
announcement but um yeah excuse me for

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,099
using the laser pointer but there's bit

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,889
in red actually changed the future of

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,260
everything because Haggadah of back then

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,060
the head of Sousa actually also sad that

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,860
thanks to doing all that research and

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:33,030
having all the clever people there maybe

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:36,310
I was included we can do level 3 support

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,710
for customers and

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,290
that was something that was not on the

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,190
market really back then I mean Red Hat

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,090
was dabbling in that as well but

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:51,070
thinking about really doing support for

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,680
paying customers all the way to actually

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,080
fixing any bug that gets to a tea

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,790
doughnut II was kind of unknown and that

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,360
changed the course of Sousa because

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,300
still even in 2000 and that is only

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,810
later Susan's main business or selling

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:12,100
boxes write the value of Sousa was that

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,830
we took all the various bits of software

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,620
that were floating out there in the open

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,620
source sea of packages actually not

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,620
packages right source code our tarpals

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,440
and created a discount of that and put

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,270
it on shelves in computer stores in

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,120
supermarkets and our sales people were

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,830
actually fighting for shelf space this

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,430
is something that's kind of unbelievable

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,200
in in today's world where you can

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,940
download everything so yeah there is no

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,200
software and a shelves on the shelves

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,840
anyway um and it was not really doing

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,160
that great anymore because yes internet

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,560
was getting faster and everybody was

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,320
downloading stuff so why do hell would

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,240
somebody go to a store to actually buy a

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,340
box I mean that was manual

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,870
we had a big documentation department we

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,550
were quite proud of it we still have a

00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,020
great documentation department but they

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,820
are focusing a little bit on different

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,650
stuff than critic creating paper books

00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,690
which was actually the main content of

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:15,550
that box so the thing that changed that

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:19,150
was IBM IBM back then requested as well

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:22,960
you have this nifty Linux distro and we

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,690
have this grand new Z 900 first or

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,640
actually second 64-bit mainframe in the

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,290
world and we are toying with the idea

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,690
actually one of our jizya engineers a

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,610
year ago did port Linux to it maybe you

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,060
could create a distro for it but it

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,340
would need to be enterprise quality and

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,380
so we just took what we'd had slept a

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,450
sticker on it saying enterprise

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,300
and that was it right the first lesson

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,170
was born in nineteen mm it didn't really

00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,080
have a version number was just this last

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,240
four for z-series for IBM it was not

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,610
really shipped many times or sold many

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,990
times but but but the name was poor at

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,920
least I mean with before we had all

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,900
other kinds of acronyms like Isuzu Linux

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,080
standard server and Susan

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:14,410
ex-professional and SUSE Linux personal

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,780
and whatever slocks was open exchange

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,510
and and there was also like a school

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:26,380
server and and all that but this one

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:28,390
kind of became the destiny and started

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,060
shaping Susan a lot Suzette back then

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,430
was still mainly doing the distro so

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,730
that the thing that originally was Susan

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,180
Linux later was openSUSE ah and then

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:42,970
using that to create the slices like

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,640
slurs eight that actually took a long

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,570
time to find that screenshot

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,280
nobody has less late screen shows

00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,950
anymore this actually is not a slow site

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,460
screenshot anymore it is a united linux

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,800
one which was less age based and it

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,500
actually was having a camera in there

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,360
although it's cause nobody noticed and

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:06,430
somebody forgot to remove it to brand it

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:10,210
as as United Linux ah

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,100
so /i it was like the first big slice

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,110
that was shipped across architectures it

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,630
actually supported even a titanium back

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,570
then there was a lot of effort and the

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:27,070
way that Suzy created it and also a

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:31,330
number of subsequent lessons was that we

00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,830
took the dot one release of matter first

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,000
Susan Linux then later

00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,729
openSUSE so the idea was that we

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,520
released it at zero it is all fresh and

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:47,080
new and somewhat buggy and then people

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,900
use it and then through that we find

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,020
bugs and once it's of reasonably stable

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,010
we do the dot one release let it run for

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,050
a while see if it's stable

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,680
and then rebranded as les with

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,940
additional things and that was the

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,440
problem that was the problem was

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,240
becoming painful because there were

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,720
these enterprises things like support

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,990
for I don't know multipath or even the

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,760
Itanium and this is because only a few

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,590
people who would probably want to have

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,450
those next to their desk ah at home what

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,980
might be more percentage than in the

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,670
usual population would be in this room

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,100
but still that's kind of unusual so the

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,870
problem was always making sure that in

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,520
the next slides release if you have all

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:37,610
those bits again because they were not

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:40,760
going back into ensues early um and then

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,040
we change it a little bit in Silesia

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,380
Levin's les 12 where there was factory

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,000
born in Oakland Azusa was branch of a

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,400
factory and Celeste was French in a

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,460
factory and and that carried us quite

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,380
well for for some time but actually

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,720
creating slash 12 was extremely

00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,880
stressful 12ga was extremely painful not

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,610
many people would remember it anymore

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:08,120
because it's a thought well hidden in

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:10,790
the brains but if I was tough right ah

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,920
it was it was tough because again that

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,010
same problem happened again we just

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:21,680
branched a factory when we lost all that

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:24,050
hardening from the previous les 11 that

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,870
went in all that Enterprise work was Co

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:29,210
totally lost because and that was a

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,610
problem right slice 11 was branched off

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,880
from factory and then sledge 11 service

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,470
pack 1 was developed from the GA version

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,300
and service pack 2 was developed from

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,620
the service service pack 2 was developed

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,020
from service pack 1 and so on

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,110
so actually none of those changes were

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,090
really going back into factory and so

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,680
when we branched off 312 we are

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,410
basically starting and Enterprise Linux

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:56,870
from scratch again and obviously that

00:10:51,410 --> 00:11:02,600
that's gotta hurt so um and then we are

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:06,620
getting like to the main or my funniest

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,710
bit of the presentation um that was so

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,840
bad that it actually

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,090
made me to create a silly story that I

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,770
presented in an all-hands back then and

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,210
I'm actually going to show you the

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,370
pictures from that silly story not

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,160
actually all the narrative would by what

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,920
because it was really kind of childish

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,180
but it did have the impact was required

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:33,710
right so it was called the tale of two

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,810
chameleons and yeah excuse that the

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,310
style because it was actually drawn in

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,990
like ten minutes ahead of that

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,970
presentation pigment because I kind of

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,590
tend to prepare these things at the very

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,690
last minute um and it was started yet

00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,340
well there were two chameleons one was

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,170
actually I will skip the names because I

00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,820
don't want them to catch on what one was

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,040
representing Slayers and the Adam was

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,950
representing openSUSE right and slash

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,210
was like the somewhat more sedentary

00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:08,660
talk while openSUSE was more adventurous

00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:11,510
and then well the hard times can came on

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,660
on that household and that was actually

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,770
a representation of the real or

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,420
financial crisis that was hitting the

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,010
industry quite badly at that time and

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,460
actually for Susan to do a lot of

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:29,060
changes it was I mean up until up until

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,890
the ten times or its last in terms we

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,330
actually had a massive departments

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,550
called the openSUSE department it was

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,230
primarily charged with Krita no Susan

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,580
and then it was the enterprise

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,320
departments it worked when taking that

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,560
and turning it into nice and shiny

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,660
enterprise stuff ah in the financial

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,930
crisis we actually well had to focus on

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,390
surviving so a lot of those openSUSE

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,580
people were well rebranded as packages

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,730
or actually taken into other roles

00:12:52,580 --> 00:13:00,920
inside of the enterprise part and we

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:03,740
said okay yes we will give full control

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,090
to opens of openSUSE community which has

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,950
happened I would just and absolutely

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,870
absolutely great step even although it

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,220
was a little bit forced by the economic

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:16,050
climate um and just have a small group

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:20,879
that will be like helping that effort

00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:24,529
ah so that happened and kind of yeah

00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:27,149
that was described by while adding the

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,249
other guy that are thus more and more

00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:33,600
adventurous going letting him free and

00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:35,519
and roaming the hills really um while

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,189
the other other one said stayed at home

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,949
de the house was actually about badly

00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:43,439
damaged and back then we had to way off

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:47,549
a lot of people so it really was kind of

00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:49,709
painful but the guy was at home that

00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:52,319
this less this less came in in he was

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,029
actually doing quite well and over the

00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:57,480
time over the various acquisitions of

00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:02,429
Susan went through we became profitable

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,170
and we became growing and well he or she

00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:12,149
may be actually turned into kind of a

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:15,600
cash cow while openSUSE was not really

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:19,459
that thriving I mean it's it's thanks to

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,679
being lenient and and and Carl say no

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:25,259
there were a lot of changes in how

00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:27,449
openSUSE was was done right there there

00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:29,910
were staging projects and see I

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:32,519
introduced and the build service was

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,410
enhanced a lot and suddenly wait even

00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,920
with small resources with not so much

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:42,439
investment from the company openSUSE was

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:47,549
really a great doing viable project and

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:49,559
yeah it's less wasn't right

00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,809
it's less twelve was painful so there

00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,220
was something broken uh in the way that

00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,160
we were doing class there this is an

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,119
image where well he can't even fit into

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,279
the house anymore

00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:00,990
so he has to be in the front porch but

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,299
there is a fence because he is kind of

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:09,149
afraid of doing anything more radical

00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:13,199
and so we knew that we have to change

00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:19,169
how we develop slots back then and um

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:23,189
well the idea was that we turn openSUSE

00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:27,310
not into the like collection of packages

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:29,410
that is tested

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,029
by the community that we provide the

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,070
packages for and we get the testing

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,610
because that value was not really there

00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:40,210
anymore

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:41,770
if we would just ignore giving the code

00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,350
back because it was not the enterprise

00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,250
code it was tested anymore it was the

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,990
that was the community code it was

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:53,470
tested so so how to be able to give more

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:56,140
and to get more and the thing that slows

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,270
was obviously missing was the agile

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,580
infrastructure off the continuous

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:03,520
integration and the staging projects and

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,250
the testing that was done on that that

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,900
was a great thing that's less could gain

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,120
what would could it what could it give

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,300
it back what it could give back was the

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,220
question so uh that's presentation

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,230
actually concluded with this noise happy

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,830
end picture and after that came the

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,460
technical part so the question was

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:26,110
what's what's happening right will they

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,270
be able to live together will they be

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,620
able to learn from each other and

00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,790
actually change the white house less

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:37,660
development may be actually openSUSE can

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:42,610
get again more from Sousa as well the

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,890
business part of it so yeah was that's

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,180
the end well actually not a lot of

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,300
things happen since that this

00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:55,420
presentation was prevented by me in what

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:59,010
is what was it 2014 and yes a lot of

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,410
those changes were already ripe as in

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,640
openSUSE had the technology developed

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:08,140
slaw is actually needed a change in

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:10,000
direction it was not that I I would well

00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,230
invent the idea of what to do it was

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,380
just like putting the things together

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,740
and pointing a finger on it

00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:19,630
so yeah the technical slide is this it's

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,980
just one of the many that were presented

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,439
this is an idea of how development

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,140
should be done that actually if we are

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,929
working on the next sleep project you

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,060
should get those packages into factory

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,130
first or ideal if there are changes that

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,170
that even are inside the packages to get

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,720
to the upstream project first get it

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,490
into development branch after ACHS it

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,100
would

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:44,309
be merged into factory or tumbleweed as

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,070
we know it today and then after

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:49,980
additional product QA it would be

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,780
accepted into class and and distributed

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,780
and this is mostly happening there were

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,290
tweaks and changes and and so on but

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,320
it's actually doing pretty well now the

00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,540
thing that the enterprise side of Sousa

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,770
could give back was of course than to

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,750
present a fusion because there is

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:11,730
competition there is sent OS there is

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,160
going to LVS those others tribution x'

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,750
were which cater to the needs of people

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,720
that don't want to live on the bleeding

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:23,070
edge right um so and and that's what the

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,720
market or whether market what the

00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,840
community is shifting i mean i at home

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
amusing openSUSE on many machines and i

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,040
don't want to upgrade them every Tuesday

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,750
although it gives me like the feeling

00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,240
that yes I have the greatest version of

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,550
packages and and so on but my wife that

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,929
is running statistical analysis for her

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,480
work on those machines is kind of

00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,670
completely upgraded my to our library

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:51,559
versions again I'll have to recoup all

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:54,120
my stuff so yeah what if we could have a

00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:58,010
community distro that has all the

00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,330
benefits of the enterprise system well

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:05,309
and that's Woodleigh peacefully and

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,750
initially there was quite a bit of chain

00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:11,550
for quite a bit of difference between

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:15,809
leap and and and then slash particularly

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:18,000
in the times of mostly 12 or way with

00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,970
the leap 42

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,210
series the kernel was different a lot of

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:26,870
config was different but with 15 we

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,240
actually finally achieved parity

00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,210
openSUSE was developed together with

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,429
which last pretty much at the same pace

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,800
even the kernel is shared you get all

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,050
that stability all that immense amount

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,290
of testing that goes into slash today

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:47,510
because yes we were not sleeping on the

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:51,210
/ side either we were adding a lot more

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,840
brute force machine power into testing

00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,240
by

00:19:51,840 --> 00:20:00,750
using open QA by actually expanding the

00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:03,330
test test setups so that we could have

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,650
what is today perceived as an enterprise

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,870
is thrown right there's a big difference

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,240
between the first last which was just an

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,580
additional sticker and and today's is to

00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,380
which were you really have high demands

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,670
of stability and performance and all

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,220
that so when we take a in the laps when

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:23,070
you take a Linux kernel it takes us more

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,500
than a year probably or almost two years

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:30,030
to get it to the level of performance

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,000
and stability that is actually

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,220
acceptable for enterprise use uh and

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,250
it's it's it's it's more than a year of

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,080
quite heavy work because the next time

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,170
we take a look at the upstream kernel is

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,600
broken again we do push all the changes

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,520
back of course and we get downstream to

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,440
perform but there are more people

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,420
working on that that focus more on

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,280
features and supporting new hardware and

00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,190
that always has a detrimental effect on

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,580
the overall performance so that's now

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,800
getting going into leap as well so yeah

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,930
from my puresoles issue I'll be very

00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:09,480
happy to have that on my on my home

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:12,710
desktop and yeah that's pretty much the

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,630
whole story of the today's keynote leap

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:22,190
it will be announced today that we have

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:22,190
a week 15 so hooray and thank you

00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,610
you

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,280
