Description: 
	What I learn while refactoring OBS

Open Build Service frontend was started in 2005, even before the first version of Rails was released.It is most likely one of the oldest Rails Project that people still keep using! That implies that legacy code and refactoring are two daily topics in all OBS developers’ lives.

As said, OBS has already some years and because of that all kind of talks about it have been held: how to use it, its features, how will it look like in the features, statistic,... but nobody has ever spoken about how it is working in such a code. I will speak about how it was facing some OBS frontend code, what kind of code got refactored and what I learned while doing it.
