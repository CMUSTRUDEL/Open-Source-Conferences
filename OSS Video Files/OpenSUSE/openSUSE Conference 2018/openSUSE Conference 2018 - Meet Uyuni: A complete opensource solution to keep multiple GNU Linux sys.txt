	00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,860
you

00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,040
you

00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,240
okay good morning welcome everyone to

00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,180
this talk maybe you already noticed that

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,689
the title is a little bit different of

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:24,130
what was announced

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:26,560
so my the first thing we are going to do

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,949
is introduce the team that is me with

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,379
here today so we have close who is our

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,870
product manager for Susanna year and we

00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:38,739
have John as well which are a full-stack

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:43,300
developer and my name is Julio and a

00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:47,950
release engineer for Susanna Gurr my

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:51,130
first question is who in this room know

00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:56,110
anything about Susan manager or space

00:00:51,130 --> 00:01:01,860
book okay cool so how many people is

00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:05,320
using any of those solutions don't worry

00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,119
okay so first I would like to talk to

00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,119
you a little bit about the space work

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,940
which is a free and open source solution

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,159
for system management which was started

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,260
by Red Hat you have the website there it

00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,380
was started around two thousand eighty

00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:23,860
and it's the ways the option code for

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,350
Red Hat satellite five but forces a

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:29,830
manager as well it's free software of

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:32,049
course but one of the problems is right

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,600
now is in maintenance mode and the

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:36,909
future is not so clear maybe you are

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,610
already aware that Red Hat started with

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:45,250
at satellite six which is not related in

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:47,650
a name in any way to spacewalk so people

00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,130
is not sure of what is going to happen

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:55,200
about it most probably it will be closed

00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:01,540
as soon as we record satellite five is

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:04,210
is out in two years so we have density

00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:07,090
memory as well which is the sensor to

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,599
record satellite it's a an opinionated

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,180
branch of space work with a lot of new

00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,739
features that you will not see there we

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,930
have simple installation but most

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,400
important we have configuration

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,920
management with so

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,530
because sue seminar includes a salt

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,490
master that we that you can use for all

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,020
of your instances we have as well

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,810
integration with containers and

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,820
kubernetes if you want if you come to

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,450
the workshop tomorrow you will see a lot

00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,400
of these and finally another important

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,950
feature is that the web interface is

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:48,080
based on react so you don't have this

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:52,760
old Java on this old and clunky Java

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:58,910
stuff so quick show of hands who have no

00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:03,590
knows about salt from salt deck okay

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:08,630
almost the same full view does anything

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:11,180
with containers or kubernetes only a few

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:16,270
so you should attend another talk about

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,270
containers good stuff okay thank you

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,760
okay so as discussed there is a

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,070
relationship between Susan manager and

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,290
spacewalk because the spacewalk is in

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,840
fact the apps reinforces a manager right

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,209
now we are going to raise really soon

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,910
Susan manager three the queue which is

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,820
based on the latest spacewalk two point

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,790
eight but Susan Anna you of course as a

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,830
spacewalk is open source the only thing

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:46,060
is that right now the development is

00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:51,320
closed so you can have the source but

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:54,860
it's not easy contributing to it anyways

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,400
you say he is it will be still

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,610
contributing to a spacewalk here you can

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,280
see for example one of one shot one

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,430
screenshot with son of our developers

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,360
commitment to the space book project as

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,390
you can see there is something

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,680
interesting and it's that the trend was

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:18,290
of heavy contribution until more or less

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,769
2014 and it is slowed down after that

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,370
the reason is one of the other problems

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:28,539
we have right now it's the launch of

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,449
record satellite six

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:38,639
let's say that Breathitt doesn't have so

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:40,840
much interest anymore on space walk so

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,800
those are the problems we have right now

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,169
the space walk team is not as because is

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,250
used to be after record satellite

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,860
physics so there there are no reviews or

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,319
integration of the patches that we are

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,409
sending some of them yes but most of

00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,599
them no because there is no time for

00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:06,340
them and not enough people to have a

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:08,590
look and the more time it passes the

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,699
more difference we have on our code

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:16,300
right now also we believe that space pod

00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:19,090
has no visual future for the project you

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:23,199
can see this quote from the space walk

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,659
FAQ so record code contributions will

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,090
decrease over time because the focus

00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:32,620
shifted to maintenance and stabilization

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,889
of the current set of futures so no more

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,990
new features for space Walker also of

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,419
course the community is concerned about

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,870
about what's going to be in the future

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:48,460
so this quote is for example from the

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:52,529
mail user mailing list people is worried

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:57,039
that slowly read that will allow

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:59,259
spacewalk to die so and quite

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,180
interesting to see that there is a very

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:07,810
active space for community why because

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:12,099
the jump from spacewalk to the satellite

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,860
six codebase katella foreman and so on

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,949
is pretty big so if you are used to

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,129
space work and the ease of use of space

00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:24,069
work jumping over to a Katella Foreman

00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:28,120
is a huge step especially for

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:31,089
enterprises they need to read train all

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,839
their people so if you follow the

00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:39,930
spacewalk mailing list it's pretty

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:42,339
active many people are on there but yeah

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:49,899
they don't know about

00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:51,579
the future so as you can see this is one

00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:55,899
of the problems we have with a pull

00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:58,149
request this one was created on 2015 and

00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:01,319
if you go to the spacewalk project you

00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:04,929
will see that it is still not merged or

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:07,869
this other one is exactly the same case

00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:12,059
and those are just two examples there

00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:15,819
are many more so the fact is that

00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:19,360
spacewalk asked it for help and until

00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:22,809
April this year there was a request for

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,449
people to help and take over the project

00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:35,739
maybe not right now but in the near

00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:39,849
future to be fair here redhead changed

00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:43,959
the FAQ in April so the quote you see

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:47,619
here is what we took as a base when we

00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:51,249
approached redhead about yeah you asked

00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:53,769
for someone to take over here we are

00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:57,189
this someone and we would like to help

00:07:53,769 --> 00:08:00,759
and we would like to take over meanwhile

00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:03,999
they changed the FAQ so this quote you

00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:07,379
won't found online but you will find it

00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,379
in the good history

00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:19,529
so our answer to this is please welcome

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,330
unique which is the name that you see

00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:26,159
now on the title of the conference and

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:28,349
in our t-shirts we wanted in the end you

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,199
take over the space work pro yet we said

00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:33,649
that we set up this openSUSE conference

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,089
as a deadline but in the end after

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:39,779
discussions with Red Hat this was not

00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,579
possible anymore so this is the new name

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,610
of the project there is no need for you

00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:48,120
to take a picture of all the URLs

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,660
because you have the QR code in case you

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,149
want to take a picture with your phone

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:59,339
anywhere anyway the website is already

00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:02,250
online and why are you nee well you need

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:07,350
well suddenly the image is not complete

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:10,170
here but ok oh yeah uni is the biggest

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,959
salt flat in the world which is in

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:19,589
Bolivia well the yo here of course is

00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:24,089
that we are using salt a lot in salads

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:25,920
or projects so the name is our tip of

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:34,170
head to saltstack

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:37,139
for their awesome salt tool so one of

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,690
the questions about the future is how is

00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,870
going to be the relationship with

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,649
spacewalker

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,620
well this split is friendly but we will

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,420
have separate communities

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:53,339
spaceball is not going to be any longer

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:56,750
the absent for uni uni and neither isuzu

00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:01,050
manager but of course it will be cold

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:04,350
moving from space book to uni from unity

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,480
space book as needed this means that we

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:10,589
are not going to break the compatibility

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,139
on purpose button like right now we will

00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,790
not prevent further improvements because

00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:22,010
of

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:25,430
that reason so our vision for the future

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:28,430
of who unis is that for this summer we

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,370
want to have fully open development this

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,190
means that we will have a public github

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,900
repository an obvious project and I

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,810
guess that everyone here is aware of

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,750
obvious we will have public continent

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:44,930
continuous integration open mailing

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,000
lists maybe an IRC channel as well and

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,970
of course the most important have first

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,410
released based right now on openSUSE

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,330
leap for two dot three then after that

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,210
but we still don't have a strict

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:02,090
timeline we will work on the next

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:07,190
release which will be based on the new

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:09,830
open source version leap 15 and we want

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,300
to release the model to define the

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,250
releasing model together with the

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,730
community so we still don't know if we

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:19,580
are going to have rolling releases or

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,700
releases each month each six months this

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,890
is something we want to discuss with all

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:31,760
the users that will we hope will come

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:33,980
from the special community and from and

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:39,290
from the open source community of course

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:41,240
on even outside so with leap 15 our

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,760
since yesterday you might be a bit

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:49,040
disappointed that uni will be boys based

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:51,650
on leap 42 but the problem here is Java

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,200
and Titan which are the main languages

00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:57,470
used in this project and especially the

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:01,640
switch to Python 3 is much more work

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:05,530
than we anticipated and yeah we are also

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:08,870
looking for help here we have many code

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:14,900
much of the code already ported but yeah

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:19,930
going to leap 15 also with a new Java

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:23,540
especially looking at Oracle's Java

00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:27,340
release model where they I think they

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:32,680
released Java 10 and gave it life

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:36,340
of six months it's a bit hard for us we

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,670
also the main team currently working on

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,340
this is working for Souza manager and we

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,100
will have a super manager release next

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:50,650
month so the team is currently busy on

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:59,830
this release but we will then find time

00:12:50,650 --> 00:13:05,740
to work upstream for uni open open all

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:10,089
the source code on github and start the

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:13,270
work on leap 15 with hopefully an

00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:20,830
initial leap 15 based release sometime

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:23,050
in autumn yeah and one of the problems

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,020
we have here as well I mean we need to

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,490
work that out is that the Python change

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,780
is not only for the source code we

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,510
created or we change from the space-boat

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:38,440
but we have some external dependencies

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:41,440
like cobra for the bare metal machines

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,210
and well for this

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,980
for example we will need to take

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:48,460
decisions with a community if we are

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:52,180
going to adapt it to Python 3 or maybe

00:13:48,460 --> 00:14:00,220
just consider some different solution to

00:13:52,180 --> 00:14:03,490
handle that so I said before unit will

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,240
be the app screen for Susan manager in

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:10,870
the same way that we have

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,959
openSUSE for Suzy the futures fund will

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,750
come from the unity of course from the

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,990
community so we are ready to accept all

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:23,380
your idea so all the ideas from the

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,690
other people and yes some examples we

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,450
don't think that uni needs to be

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:32,500
restricted only to openSUSE

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:35,059
right now we have support or or units

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,629
able to work not only with

00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:41,269
openSUSE but with Santos with Red Hat

00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:43,879
Enterprise Linux Linux as well but we

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:47,869
would like to add support of course for

00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:49,309
Debian Ubuntu or any other distributions

00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:52,969
that the community can consider

00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:55,639
interesting and not only annex well

00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:59,899
maybe if somebody wants to add supports

00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,699
you vsee or tomatoes or to Microsoft

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,289
Windows that should be possible as well

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:07,129
just lations

00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:12,169
or any idea that the community can have

00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:17,359
about the future so and if anyone thinks

00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:23,029
that Windows that sound strange well we

00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:26,179
have code ready to manage Windows it is

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,989
possible through the range windows

00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:40,429
management in instrumentation and it

00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:43,549
Maps quite well to who you need so how

00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:48,169
can you be part of our community at this

00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:50,899
moment you can follow the Twitter by the

00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:53,599
way you will find the correct Twitter

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,539
account at the website because I didn't

00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,489
change it change it here you can already

00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,619
sign up at our mailing list right now

00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:03,709
it's only for announcements but this

00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:05,839
will change really really soon and of

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:09,769
course you can spread the word about

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,349
this new project and for the new future

00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,509
and that means in the following weeks

00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:17,779
some of these things and during the

00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:21,439
summer orders you will be able to report

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,780
problems and wishes you will be able to

00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:27,310
repair

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:31,000
to report it initially via the mailing

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:34,030
lists or maybe IRC under in the summer

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,090
of course via github issues most

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:40,690
important you will be able to fork the

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:46,960
hip-hop project and send us your pull

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:52,330
request and I don't want to scare anyone

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:57,610
away at this point but this project is

00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:03,100
not a simple configure and make it's

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:05,800
much more complex so we work on

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,100
contributions but you should really

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:13,690
start with one of the prepackaged

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,960
versions or even the vagrant images we

00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:22,240
will distribute and start from from

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,760
there but it's it's complex it's it's a

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:32,940
beast

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:36,070
lots of Java code Tomcat and so on but

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,070
anyway you don't need to rewrite the

00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:42,240
whole the whole Unicode base you can

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,100
start with as always with small fixes

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,860
learning all the stuff that we have

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,630
inside yeah well in in this case it's

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,250
especially important to have good

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,040
communication with us with the team

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,020
we're always happy to give you some

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,960
pointers help you with some stuff to

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,650
begin with the code base and yeah it's

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,410
like always maybe it's the best idea to

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,780
pick up some small small tiny bugs to

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:15,520
get used with the corpus and yeah we're

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:18,660
always there to give you a hand so the

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,190
interesting thing is that tomorrow at

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,170
1:00 p.m. we are going to have a

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:29,040
workshop at their room 305 so it will be

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,740
a practical demo of uni

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,650
this means we are not going to show it

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,980
on the screen you will install it on

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:40,590
your laptops using bar and images will

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,920
practice installation you will use it to

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,860
manage openSUSE leap instances you will

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,070
learn how to build publish and manage

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,930
docker images as well and you will take

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,850
this installation with you so you can

00:18:51,930 --> 00:19:01,110
play at home at the office or wherever

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:05,130
you want so remember tomorrow at 1 p.m.

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:07,440
at room 305 and there is something

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:12,900
important as well those images are

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:16,260
pretty big around 50 gigabytes so it

00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,190
will take a lot of time downloading them

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:25,680
on the Wi-Fi here so we are going to

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:29,190
stay upstairs at the room 3 to 2 and you

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,680
can come today or tomorrow before the

00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,680
workshop to download to download the

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,060
images you can just plug in your in our

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,820
network and in 10 to 15 minutes you will

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:46,950
have everything you need to run the

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:49,890
workshop tomorrow so at this point I

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:52,500
guess that you should have some

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:56,670
questions that we are happy to answer

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,280
about this about the relationship with

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:03,240
spacewalk the future how you may

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:09,290
contribute or whatever you can think of

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,290
about so we are ready for questions

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:26,080
too much for everyone yeah you can ask

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:30,900
what is sold or whatever you want but we

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,900
will have we will give short answers

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:49,710
that's correct yeah was open to this

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:58,809
fedora was sent to us with rel with

00:20:49,710 --> 00:21:00,850
Oracle Enterprise Linux and so on will

00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:06,640
it work with both leap and tumbleweed

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:09,100
yes there's one catch who you already

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,260
mentioned it the images you will

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,460
download for the workshop tomorrow is 50

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:18,399
gigabytes why because it contains all

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,990
the distribution packages so with

00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:24,760
tumbleweed you will have the problem

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:28,720
that you will have a lot of downloads to

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:31,120
keep the packages in your unit instance

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,100
up-to-date because this is the core of

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,169
this project it knows about the all the

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,240
packages and it knows about all the

00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:43,059
packages which are on this on your

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,279
clients and can do version comparison

00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,059
and can tell you hey on this client you

00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:53,740
need to update your kernel or whatever

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:58,470
so this is the main problem with problem

00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,720
in quotes with tumbleweed and of course

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:12,370
most of your clients will be always

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:18,429
out-of-date there is already code inside

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:20,740
for Debian Ubuntu but it's not heavily

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,710
tested and also on the space for

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,289
community there are questions once in a

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,680
while some people get it to work others

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:35,650
don't so this is

00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:41,130
currently uncertain but the the basic

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:44,400
operations are not tied to any specific

00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:48,960
operating system so we know that

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:53,730
spacewalk in the past worked with

00:22:48,960 --> 00:23:01,170
Solaris for example but the code is

00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:06,520
unmaintained and the status unknown and

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:09,100
in case you don't intend to install uni

00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,680
yourself then if you're working in a

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:22,990
company or at a university talk to your

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:25,410
sis ID men and spread the word any other

00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,410
questions

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,240
then again we will welcome you for the

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:39,650
workshop tomorrow and remember to come

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:45,700
up as test to get your images and we

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:48,770
will be around you can recognize that us

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:52,880
because we have these t-shirts when we

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:55,299
are the only ones yet thank you thank

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,299
