alright then so thanks you all for

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,750
coming this is the closing session of

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,929
the conference I hope everybody's had a

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,550
good conference you know yeah annual

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,550
blah blah blah with the board or the

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,650
annual discussion with the board this

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,619
year we're doing the format a little bit

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,960
differently mainly because we've been

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,880
doing things a little bit differently

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,189
but just to kind of start with the very

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,239
basics because I don't expect everybody

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:38,430
here to know exactly what the board does

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,920
the openSUSE board these yeah these five

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,989
and me are the group in the project who

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,129
are kind of ultimately responsible for

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,110
leading the project it's kind of

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,579
inverted quotes because you know you

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,309
guys are in charge of the contributors

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,199
really but we're the the central point

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,399
of contact if but he knows who to get in

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,219
touch with someone once you know that

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,020
just some where it's openSUSE the board

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,570
is there is kind of the default default

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,129
contact point we've resolved conflicts

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,570
in the community when yeah whenever you

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,900
have a problem when nobody else can help

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,430
you know contact the board on the same

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,960
kind of line of that when it comes to

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,299
decision making you know if there's ever

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,490
a situation where contributors and then

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,990
the like don't feel that they you know

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,909
are in a position where they can decide

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,799
you know they need to need somebody else

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,770
to make a decision for them where

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,310
they're we're also the main contact

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,020
point for souza and vice versa and this

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,250
last line actually wasn't enough

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,380
documentation will talk about more that

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,680
later but you know generally speaking

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,890
the board is kind of a source of ideas

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,259
for project wide discussions and new

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,490
ideas and wanna start that stuff from

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,399
where we're thinking of changing things

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,079
in the project and yes I mean we're all

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,100
sitting deciding here but we had our

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,860
board meeting this week where we yeah

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,159

mailing lists I try to build some

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,830
packages once in a while but that's

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,420
about it

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm Simon I have my own microphone

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,930

maintainer for a bunch of packages and

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,140
then somehow I ended up on the suzer

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,050
maintenance team and I do a bunch of

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,320
other random fixes for things like

00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:02,730
breaking the installer often and all

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,550
sorts yeah so we've all been in Prague

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,290
for a couple extra couple of days so

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,700
yeah we've all been in Prague for an

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,340
extra couple of days having our annual

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,230
board meeting which is kind of the the

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,610
chance for us to sit down figure out you

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,419
know what the big-ticket items the

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,299
project needs to address and also this

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,340
the some of the ideas that we want to

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,470
bring to the project but you know we

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,180
weren't always working it wasn't you

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,570
know

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,570
yeah it wasn't too much hard work yeah

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,520
but you know we weren't always drinking

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,870
beer we did kind of get in trouble

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,660
because we took a bottle of wine into

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,970
the suzer office yeah

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,440
so for then for the next bit of this

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,240
talk we're gonna kind of go through one

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,290
at a time on some of the topics we were

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,150
covering what we decided what we've done

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,190
what we need your help to do more with

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,570
and then at the end we have the open

00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,670
session where you can kind of just ask

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,720
us anything give you feedback on these

00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,040
ideas that kind of thing so next up is

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,180
Anna talking about communicating with

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,740
the board actually yeah that'll work

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,690
better and I'll introduce each topic

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,690
because we didn't rehearse this at all

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:23,600
okay yeah so the communication with the

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:29,130
war veteran here then I won't have yeah

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:32,840
yeah so if you want to contact us you

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,540
can do it any time retinas in into the

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,790
open circulatory email we have now so

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,150
this week we decided that we one that

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,910
everybody can add items in our online

00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,400
meetings that takes place every two

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,700
weeks so that everybody can go to the

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,300
paid stir and add the topics onion

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,080
they were will discuss but you can also

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,420
email us the topics to the mailing list

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,590
if you don't want to do it like public

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:09,020
and of course public discussions work on

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:13,860
the project mailing list with everybody

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,680
so and this week we have making be

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,290
making a lot of changes in the Wickham

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,940
so especially we have been focusing on

00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,120
the information about the war because it

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,300
was what I outdated was the war was

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,490
doing so there was some activities per

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,980
year that were not really what the war

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,850
was doing anymore so we restructure all

00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,540
the information we updated the bow our

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,220
page

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,740
the meeting page

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,280
also they the elections on membership

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,870
although that is so it that was changed

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,910
recently move probably most of you

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,310
already know that there was some email

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,350
and so on but the wiki's estate outdated

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,710
so the recent season working progress

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,080
but we are working on it yeah they they

00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,570
news them in the wiki that is actually

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,930
not something that was doing some

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:05,310
sternal contributors are working on new

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,700
redesigning the wiki but we thought it

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,780
was a good idea to to maintain it here

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,430
and we are also discussing adding it's

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,140
not related with the quickest but with

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,230
the new setup instead of torque so

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:22,710
currently we don't have any license and

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:26,340
as we are open source and we like open

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,130
things we think that our news fate

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,790
should also have a open content license

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,190
and we will think what license could fit

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,490
better and maybe there will be some

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:40,110
discussions and yeah listen so I still

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,260
we haven't decided what lines in long

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,820
how will this reality but we want to

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,820
have a license and open license Sarah

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,370
okay so for those of you who've been

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,140
around the project for a while you may

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,630
remember once upon a time we had an

00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,140
ambassador's program then we had an

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:03,540
advocates program basically the program

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,270
wasn't really in use anymore and the

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,780
last remains of the program were the

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,600
wiki pages and so we have now cured off

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,860
officially the ambassadors or advocates

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,540
with a replacement wiki page as you can

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,270
see they're open SUSE our events and

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,400
that tells anyone who would like to run

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,800
an event what they need to do how they

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,060
can get marketing materials and anything

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,280
they would need to run an event because

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,530
really we would like you to all be

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,200
ambassadors for the project and we don't

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:41,969
need to have a select small group from

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:44,760
various places I'm a long way from the

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,040
next slide button everyone's favorite

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,560
mailing lists so we have decided to

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,110
create a new openSUSE support mailing

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,720
list for any support quest

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,120
and queries there's a few there's a

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,570
couple people subscribed already so feel

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,420
free to send your your support questions

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,740
to this mailing list rather than factory

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:12,750
mailing list which happens a lot or

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:14,579
openSUSE as well we would also like to

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,899
reduce the noise on the openSUSE factory

00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:20,670
mountain list so if you start creating

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,589
bug reports things that should be bug

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,019
reports there I will probably start

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,149
sending probably friendly emails at

00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,920
first then getting slightly grump here

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,959
is if you keep doing it and say

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,430
basically we would like anything that

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,029
only really affects one or two packages

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,680
to become a bug report on that package

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,360
if it is a more general support sort of

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,100
thing or you're not sure if it's a bug

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,399
or not send an email to the support

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,839
mailing list instead and to help is

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,769
confusion the support mailing list

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,269
covers support for tumbleweed leap beta

00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,329
versions of leap and everything like

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,329
that

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:03,410
yes when we have spoken about feature

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:08,610
requests open faith is shutting down

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:12,390
because if it wasn't really used by

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,990
developers but we have feature we have

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:19,560
customers who had a feature request and

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,620
wanted to add them so we thought about a

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:26,579
solution we and our solution is to

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:30,269
report it directly to upstream on github

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:33,980
and if we have other projects we would

00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:39,300
use a package era for feature requests

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:44,970
we I want to create a wiki page for it

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,910
and so everybody can find the right

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:55,199
place for a special feature request you

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:58,350
want to it and also we will like that

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:00,630
like everybody having a pro yet in open

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,180
so say at all so the way people can

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,920
track the Box in the wiki page so

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,970
because we can of course create the page

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,919
but we don't know how

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,619
all of the things are working on where

00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:14,639
they are tracking the users so that we

00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:19,049
will need some help there so another

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,959
problem we have is that asleep box a

00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:24,329
private so which is annoying especially

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,669
in the lip development because you see a

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:30,059
change look with a puck number but can't

00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:32,489
see what is behind that puck and this is

00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,679
obviously problem when we want to work

00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:37,909
together and we want to work together

00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:40,619
and do it a lot so our temporary

00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:43,139
solution is to create a mailing list

00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:46,079
buck share at open source or Advil can

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,879
send the mail like please open up box

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,779
number one two three

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:54,839
and then you will in the perfect case

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,789
someone will trust make it public and if

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,619
that isn't public because it contains

00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:00,539
through the customer data then you

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:03,149
should at least get a summary so that

00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:06,539
you know what it is about and on the

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:09,839
long term solution we are we hope for a

00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:13,879
better way which could be a box ela

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,529
component like chat box between leap

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:20,819
tumbleweed and Slee which are public by

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:24,179
default and that should hopefully make

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:26,849
things better in the future and we will

00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,619
also encourage the Susy engineers to

00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:31,319
file leap a tumbleweed box by default

00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,869
and avoid the sleep box ela component

00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:35,669
when it's possible

00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:38,849
yeah I'm just an extra thing for the the

00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:40,349
book share meaningless that's staffed by

00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:42,569
Susy employee so starting with kind of

00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:44,789
me in Simon and I think a few others

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:46,079
have already volunteered because you

00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:47,369
know Sousa are happy with Susan

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,959
engineers you know checking that we're

00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:50,849
not gonna share you know publicly a

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,339
customer data when we pump that out so

00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:54,779
if you're a Sousa engineer who's also an

00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,579
openSUSE contributor and you kind of

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,049
care about this problem you know please

00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,369
mail the board and you know we can look

00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,199
at adding you to that list so you can

00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,199
can help with that but this is via

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,360
I've already been added to it somebody

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:19,480
did somebody did it already

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:22,090
yes so they are the friends of open

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,450
source basically they the price we are a

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:28,180
sponsor or helping like there are many

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,240
shopkins responses many projects and

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,650
conference and this was already a topic

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,930
during the elections like that was the

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,340
question what do you think about this

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,430
and what other projects you would like

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,560
to contribute with and everybody was

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,270
really happy with contributing with the

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,670
praise although nobody knew was for

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,040
years though and then we want to make

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,900
this information transparent that's

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,820
there is a wiki page where we track what

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,610
projects or we what conference or events

00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,260
we are sponsoring and not in this way

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,170
everybody can say yes new things we

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,580
should sponsor at the moment it it is

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,410
not clear what we are sponsoring with

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,740
not and then it's difficult to say yes

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:14,530
new things and it also a a good

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:16,630
opportunity to to stick to say what is

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,370
the project will find important I want

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,200
to support and also at the community

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,300
maybe not only say it other projects but

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,980
discuss if the current projects will be

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:31,660
a sponsor as well and apart from that

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,060
our partner so currently for lift 15 we

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,900
have at least or that we know these two

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,190
projects yeah so yeah Filipe 15 we had

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,170
this kind of weird situation exactly

00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,390
this is a follow on topic from something

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,080
the board talked about last year we

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:49,300
wanted to kind of start reaching out to

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,460
other companies who wanted to do stuff

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,810
with openSUSE using it in their products

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,750
as well so sort of things like hardware

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,520
manufacturers and cloud providers and

00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,580
stuff like that and yeah you know a year

00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,070
later we have these two examples where

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,960
you know we launched leap on Friday and

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,430
both tuxedo with their hardware business

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,670
and line ode with their cloud business

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,290
have support for leap 15 already they

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,970
launched it on the same day as we did

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,350
they worked with us what we were

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,690
developing it

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,520
and yeah this is something which you

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,800
know we wanted to encourage more

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,140
companies and other projects to kind of

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,600
work with us on you know these aren't

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,280
exclusive deals by you know any stretch

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,860
of the imagination you know we didn't

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,720
study contracts with anybody just the

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,420
case of sort of yeah working with them

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,620
and yeah helping them with various bugs

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,140
on teaching them how to contribute to

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,610
factory and how we think and how we work

00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:46,060
and that kind of thing yeah so if you

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:49,060
want to have a VPS you can go in yeah

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,340
log into line owed sign up get lead 15

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,630
already and I don't want to spoil the

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,920
surprise for that box sitting on there

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:59,800
but yeah tuxedo also now are selling

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,540
leap laptops and they also will be

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,730
having neap laptops with nice openSUSE

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,970
sent stenciled on the back which is an

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,770
incredibly nice touch as well anything I

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,919
forgot

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,919
[Music]

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:26,650
okay matrix we are looking for new ways

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,590
to communicate with each other young

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:35,830
people don't use IRC they don't use

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:38,140
forums etc and we found matrix to seem

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,270
to be a good solution for us since you

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,710
can access it within all with all kinds

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:51,610
of protocols and use it in very much to

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:54,670
differ in any different ways we are

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,280
considering and that needs to take place

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,110
the next over the next couple of months

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,950
but we are considering to have our own

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,050
matrix server so that we can provide the

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:09,490
infrastructure for it and it will always

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:12,280
work for the moment these are plans and

00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,200
we'd like we invite you all to send

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,170
emails to the board or discuss this on a

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:24,460
project mailing list if what to tell us

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:27,330
what you think about it yeah this is one

00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:31,600
that's been on my mind for quite a while

00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:35,140
in my experience from the forum's in IRC

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
our biggest problem are not the nvidia

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,080
cards not the broad comms etc it's

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,460
upgrading people are afraid of upgrading

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,850
because they think they will bought

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,940
their system even though we showed them

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:52,630
in open QA that we test all this

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:58,540
retested again and it works that's a big

00:17:52,630 --> 00:18:00,420
problem we thought or I thought a year

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,560
ago I started talking on a conference

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,850
why would we not have service packs I

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,540
thought too little bit about it and this

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:12,820
seems to be a problem currently but

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,270
service packs would be easy you download

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,310
it click it installs your e board and

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,620
you're on the next version and for a lot

00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,860
of people that's different from changing

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,730
some numbers and running zip

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:31,230
up this is also something we'd like you

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,809
to think about sent plans on project

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:38,390
mailing lists have a discussion about it

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,390
and like always something will come out

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:48,480
so we've been also discussing the

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,460
conference organization the team this

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,350
year has done a wonderful job most of

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,059
you guys won't have seen too many issues

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,179
with it it's been a fantastic conference

00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:59,010
but we as the board think possibly there

00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:02,640
are some better ways we can organize the

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:05,690
conference the openSUSE asia community

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,830
that has a fantastic example for

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,260
organizing conferences where they have a

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,750
board or a not a board but a committee

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,020
put together from previous conference

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,870
organizers that they then used to decide

00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,080
and help facilitate each conference so

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:25,559
there is some continual leti every year

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,830
with the same group of people overseeing

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:32,370
stuff but then it's up to the local team

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:35,190
to run the conference itself and it

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,780
makes the communication lines for who's

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,690
doing what in the conference a bit

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,450
cleaner and a bit clearer there has also

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,940
been people suggesting to us that they

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,559
might like to host the conference

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,780
somewhere other than Prague or Nuremberg

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,130
which is something that maybe we will

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:55,200
look out for 2020 certainly for 2019 I

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,240
think it's gonna be most likely the

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,450
conference will be in Nuremberg but we

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,020
are open to calls for proposals and if

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,290
those proposals can provide a compelling

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,450
business case then that is something

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,580
that we will put forward but there is a

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,010
note on that that if you look around

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,650
this room there are many suzer employees

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,570
and suzer is the major sponsor of the

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,600
conference would probably like to have

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,370
the conference somewhere where it's not

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,169
too hard to send their employees so that

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,770
would always be a consideration in a bit

00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:32,330
and so I am just gonna read the slides

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,330
because I just talked about stuff

00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:38,510
but yet I think I've covered everything

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,360
there yeah I think you got everything

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,550
cool and yeah that's kind of a summary

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,980
of everything we were talking about at

00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,380
the board meeting this week so now it's

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,690
kind of up to you what is your feedback

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,970
what would you like to see both not just

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,350
for this conference but yeah in the

00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:04,880
projects generally do you have any

00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:06,260
questions this is the fun complicated

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,650
part where we all spend ages figuring

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,910
out who's gonna answer so my question

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,850
would be what would be the real

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:19,070
difference between your leap 15 service

00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,110
pack and 15.1 isn't it just a label and

00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,720
it's a shitty that's a really shitty

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,770
reason because if if the people are

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,340
afraid that they are afraid of the

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,630
content not also labeled that Dericks to

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:35,900
you they're the same i see daily posts

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:39,710
from people that are afraid of doing

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,390
things in the terminal if you have a

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,150
service pack and it would be something

00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:54,820
like a one-click install that would be

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:59,510
different for them on that same topic

00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,310
well I agree that the migration the

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,370
tooling like we use for slush would be

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,870
great to have for leap the naming I can

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:09,200
tell you from my experience working in

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,720
this Slee world for many years won't get

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,280
you far because our customers also think

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,400
service packs are like major releases

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,200
and we even sometimes a in product

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,480
management trying to figure out how can

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,180
we change that perception by maybe even

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,280
thinking about different ways of up

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,290
doing the updates to our major releases

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,940
and not calling them service packs or

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,270
trying to find a different way to do it

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,070
that lowers that also that perception

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,580
threshold but we have the same problem

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:40,130
on Slee with the service pack but the

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,430
migration obviously would be great so

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,520
Dantley and openSUSE have a common

00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,630
problem

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,929
and I'd like this is just an idea to

00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,150
brainstorm on it and I've been around in

00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:56,610
this community for years and I've seen

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,700
lots of suggestions like this and always

00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,200
something comes out and if something

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,390
doesn't come out we have found better

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,340
ways um so I appreciate that you bring

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,429
in more witness for work for openSUSE

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,470
but we just this year lost hetner having

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,400
openSUSE as officially the distribution

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,400
as had changed

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:24,990
yes No so I can talk about this because

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,790
I'm ahead to the customer and it was

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,200
actually a really really long head to

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,750
the support ticket because I was like

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,210
yelling at them for like months

00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,710
so yeah heads nah big German hosting

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,010
provider used to do a lot of stuff with

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:41,700
openSUSE they no longer list openSUSE on

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,260
any of their official images they do now

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,710
after the discussion that I had with

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:50,610
them have support for openSUSE as a VNC

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,710
installer so that is still there all of

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:55,320
their source code for they're installing

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,290
tools are in github and do work with

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,040
leap 15 so officially we're not listed

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,540
but in fact it just worked and I'm

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,160
working with them and I would like more

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,809
people if especially if you are hitting

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,610
the customer like file a support ticket

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:10,530
because they've you know they might

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,260
realize on aggregate just how many of us

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,090
there are but yeah so it's it's an

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,070
ongoing work in progress and to be

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,179
honest I'm speaking personally and this

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,230
is gonna be recorded and I'm gonna

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,790
regret it I guess they get the feeling

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,990
they're shifting more more towards their

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:29,550
head to the cloud product so the better

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,679
way for openSUSE to be more easily

00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,410
present there would be for us to get our

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,370
like OpenStack images more as a top-tier

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,860
openSUSE

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:39,630
delivery because then they can just use

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,800
our official OpenStack image if we had

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:46,490
one so work in progress but it's not as

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,990
bad as it was six months ago

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,520
okay one ask questions and opens

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:54,320
automating this wouldn't that be just

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,320
the same as openSUSE test support

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:02,840
because you didn't mistake to put it on

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:05,780
the slide yes and now there are some

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:09,430
similarities there but the openSUSE

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:12,890
mailing list for a long time had a very

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:15,650
focus on back in the day what were the

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,360
open seas our stable releases and if you

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,240
mentioned something related to factory

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,170
at that time which is there migrated

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,050
onto tumbleweed

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,810
often you will get users telling you

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,280
that this is for support of stable

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,230
things and go away with your question to

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,390
open this is a factory which is the

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,610
problem we're trying to fix so one of

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,430
the ways we would like to fix it is by

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,080
making the name clearer and kind of

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,590
giving the whole thing a refresh and

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,760
revamp is a new thing yeah so what to

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,680
kind of put it another way I mean

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,170
obviously having a new support mailing

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,350
list means you know the the nature of

00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:53,090
openSUSE act is likely to naturally

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:54,740
evolve as a result of you know

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,990
openSUSE support being the official

00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,470
support mailing list we'll see how that

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,000
works out like you know yeah we'll see

00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,620
what we end up with we'll see what needs

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,280
to be fixed there maybe nothing does

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,050
maybe it all works out fine so I have a

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,670
similar question so I was wondering have

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,350
you considered splitting off and

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,210
openSUSE leap mailing list because

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,910
currently we have both the tumbleweed

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,620
snapshots and any leap updates during

00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:21,800
the development process both all going

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,840
to the factory mailing list and also

00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:29,900
questions from users about packages in

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:32,000
there and twelve problem reports but

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,690
what would you like to see is to at

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,830
least make openSUSE factory openSUSE

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:42,650
factory again and not support questions

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:46,750
not a kind of platform for tumbleweed

00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:51,200
users one single support mailing list I

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:53,710
think could very well do it's about

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,710
support

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,360
but the most I'm not just support I mean

00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,500
that's not just support this also the

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:07,160
development phase this is something we

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:10,070
did talk about this week we did kick the

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,090
idea around but we kind of thought you

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,340
know that's not trying to change too

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,960
much all in one go you know so we're

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,030
starting this with openSUSE support at

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,620
you know and they're kind of suggesting

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,690
for bugzilla first stuff for the mailing

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,220
lists you know those things it should be

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:27,110
in Bugzilla if factory still is a little

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,670
bit too muddled then of course that kind

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,830
of thing is like the natural next thing

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:32,690
to talk about and discuss but yeah

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:36,050
there's no decisions made there can I

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,370
just say that as I on the board I think

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:40,130
there has been far too much noise on

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:41,390
that list over the last year and I am

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,130
willing to do anything to change it so

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:55,670
that there is not too much noise on that

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:58,820
list but this is the first step I have a

00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:00,440
question about the membership well how

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,630
to become a membership I think there was

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,140
a discussion about changing it to one

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,660
contribution only and not the like

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,570
long-term contributing as a requirement

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:14,120
and in the wiki workshop that we

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,580
attended we tried to change a few things

00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,080
but no it wasn't really clear if that

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,460
changed or not because I don't I

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,250
couldn't find an official announcement

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:25,820
how that works now so just like how does

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:29,450
that go these days well we worked it out

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:32,110
but we want the one thing we want is

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:35,090
that it's much easier to become a member

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,460
my personal point of view

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,070
anybody who downloads openSUSE Dog

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,890
openSUSE installs it on his laptop just

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:47,270
to try it it's already contributing if

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:50,510
he gives some feedback and if people

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:53,809
organize local events etc etc they

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:58,309
should be able to become members it

00:28:53,809 --> 00:29:00,350
needs adjustment in wiki I think he's

00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,650
also speaking about the documentation we

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:06,169
have fun we yeah that's it is already

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,160
updated so this is already we used a new

00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:08,960
I mean the

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,850
stas discussion in private everybody

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,770
agrees so it is already a pinup light

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,780
the only thing that is missus updating

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,120
the documentation in the wiki there was

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,860
someone pricing the concerns employers

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,200
and we were also discussing about it

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,360
this week and then I think Ritter is

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,180
going to update this documentation right

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:34,970
the wiki so it will be updated as soon

00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:39,920
as Ritter has time two points first why

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:43,010
we need members apart wait a minute

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,100
apart from giving us work my Meg is not

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,200
working my croc is not working and

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,420
nobody else taking care of them and

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,660
second point okay I understand we need

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,460
members to vote then way we want even

00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,540
more people to vote apart from the

00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,010
people that are actually contributing

00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:02,240
how we draw a line there so our tackle

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,680
both of those because I was the guy who

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,390
put the proposal on the mailing list but

00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,670
the tuning it up we need members to

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,560
primarily to vote on decisions like the

00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,720
board you know who is on the board and

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,220
we need them to decide on those trickier

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,180
decisions where the board doesn't you

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,100
know can't make a decision all the

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,080
community can't make a decision and

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,670
that's pretty much it not much else you

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,020
know it is it's just a case of you know

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,840
if you opened it up to the big wide

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,730
world of everybody you know you had you

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,700
know you have the risk of you know yeah

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:32,660
you know boaty mcboatface becoming the

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,050
name of the new open to the distribution

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,670
so you know it's really just a case of

00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,790
making sure that openSUSE people are

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,420
voting on openSUSE topics the kind of

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:53,090
issue of also what's the second question

00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:54,710
again is it for mommy yeah so yeah who's

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,480
gonna deal with the the mailing list

00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,480
issues oh these are the issues with the

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,160
mail aliases that that is is something

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,290
we kind of brushed on slightly in the

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,180
top of that you know the the with the

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:08,270
update of the documentation you can

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:11,240
expect also talk on the project mailing

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:13,580
list starting soon about what we want to

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,490
do with the tooling the general thing we

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:19,190
decided to cut together this week was

00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,680
the whole process of like connect and

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,990
the approval process and the membership

00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,150
officials and like waiting for somebody

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,790
to look at that proposal and blah blah

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,980
blah blah and then you hit the button in

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,960
connect and it doesn't make the mailing

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,700
alias property so you go and bug tio and

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,660
tio starts crying yeah all of that is

00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:46,340
like ridiculously over-engineered

00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:47,360
yeah yeah just slightly yeah it's four

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,880
years to realize that but it's

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,680
ridiculous you open it so this is you

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,060
know the board decision you know because

00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,530
we don't want to overstep our bounds the

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:57,470
board decision is we want to address

00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,580
that exactly how you know the current

00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,500
membership officials can expect

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,170
discussions or email starting soon on

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,250
you know our idea basically I mean

00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,690
what's wrong with like a shared

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,730
spreadsheet for heaven's sake you know

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,770
email addresses in an e-mail or you know

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,260
we the approval process the request

00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,060
process could just be a contributor

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,190
wants to be a member they email the

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,440
membership officials quick discussion

00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,560
quick to pay quick entry on a mate on a

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,060
you know on a CSV file somewhere CSV

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,860
file goes running that scripts and maker

00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,540
email aliases for you so you have you

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,170
know nothing to do we could replace you

00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,170
with a cron job

00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:48,620
sound good I have a comment about the

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:54,500
service spec discussion so what I think

00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:57,860
is would be much much better if we would

00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:01,190
have some mechanism to actually tell the

00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,740
user that you're Susan leap is out of

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,490
date and then he can decide if he says

00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:10,790
yeah update and then the some tool tries

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:13,700
to do to put in the new repository seed

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:16,250
he do say update and if he messed around

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,200
with with CIPA and his repositories and

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,730
maybe he has to fix it on his own but at

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:26,540
least forth for user said just want to

00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:29,660
use Linux that would be a good solution

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,550
and they won't I mean they won't just

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,370
start to address repositories and that's

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,410
more like power user for me yeah so that

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,540
would be a good solution to really be

00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,900
able to tell someone like I don't know

00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,810
my mother then you can use openSUSE leap

00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,580
because if I know right now I can tell

00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,410
my mother yeah you can use openSUSE leap

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,940
but hey you have to look when there is a

00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:52,610
new version because then you have to

00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:56,270
touch some files to update and that's

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,800
not what the normal user wants to do I'm

00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,330
sure we have an opinion but all he likes

00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,430
looks like he's gonna try and climb up

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,670
the wall so I'm gonna let him say

00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,140
something first just as a last thing I

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:11,450
think there was a heck bit project on

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:14,090
this I don't know where it ended up so I

00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:17,900
also think you have found to write

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:21,260
problems I this was also the biggest

00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,440
surprise to me when I saw it was first

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,680
overnighter and souza is that this whole

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,450
openSUSE upgrade is I mean it's the

00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,310
server specs they are really there's

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,160
marketing that it's a whole new product

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,870
which is cool it has cool new features

00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,850
but it really scares people also like oh

00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:44,660
I need to go to a new product so I still

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:45,980
run open to sleep 42.2 that is not

00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,170
really addressed with the service pack

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,300
thingy I think it will make it worse

00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,850
I like the dot number I mean if you can

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,380
take a look - it's like Debian which has

00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,180
a major number and the lower numbers and

00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,300
you get them automatically why is the

00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,280
done well who would do that I mean you

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,900
you raise the right idea I think you

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,430
could put that in as a maintenance

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,590
update who would do the maintenance

00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:11,360
updates in openSUSE I think this is a

00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:13,550
limiting factor and it's not addressed

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,240
by relabeling it we have all the tools

00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:19,340
available functional technically I think

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,350
so if the board wants to drive that it

00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:25,580
would be really cool but I think it is

00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:28,730
to be more driven on the side of project

00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,640
management or who as a contributor could

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,010
contribute in that direction and then

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,230
maybe even there we will come up with a

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,910
really cool technical solution that I

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,190
cannot even think of right now I

00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,280
wouldn't like to make the decision now

00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,910
but really leave it

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,740
to that task for is that that group or

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,330
something I mean everybody learns here

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,370
how to do packaging how to do new

00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,460
packages but you know how to handle end

00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:58,350
of life of a minor version I think it

00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:00,450
has been never a topic yeah I I agree I

00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,130
think I do kind of personally agree with

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,220
your point of view um but you know from

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,410
the board's perspective you know we you

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,790
know we probably purposefully say we

00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,900
don't make technical decisions on the

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,580
project unless you know contribute

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,200
responders to you so yeah you can

00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,320
consider that kind of service pack idea

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,550
as identifying the problem you know it

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,740
can be down to the community to how to

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,080
fix it you know if there is a technical

00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,880
solution and I think there is you know

00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,190
let's try it you know that we've you

00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,110
know talked to talk to Dominic talked to

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,850
a little weak you know let's see what we

00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:34,200
can do to really smooth an that sort of

00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:38,010
thing out and so now that there's a much

00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:42,620
closer relationship between openSUSE and

00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:49,040
Slee with the leaps 15 Slee 15 thing

00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:51,710
will Sousa be more proactive in

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,630
promoting that relationship and

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,440
promoting the project at events that

00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,790
Sousa are at so as an example you've got

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:09,260
lc3 coming up in Beijing Souza's a

00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:09,260
diamond sponsor their ideal opportunity

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:20,380
I tried I can't give an official from

00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,760
the entirety of Sousa answer on this

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,800
topic just to be honest we haven't

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,480
discussed it at that kind of level where

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,100
I can say you know like Susan like Paul

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,850
of marketing management is who's a

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:34,840
greeter exactly what you said what I can

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:37,780
say is the people at Sousa who we did

00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,580
talk about talked to on the topic of Lee

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,630
pitously migrations because leap 15 if

00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,010
you haven't noticed in the release

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,780
announcement is the first version of

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,660
leap where Suzy will actually support

00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:51,130
migrating from leap to Slee in place as

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,720
part of a zippered up from suicide part

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,970
of the product management and

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,520
engineering management reason for

00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,670
justifying adding that support and

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,500
committing to that was exactly so Suzy

00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,630
could start doing that kind of thing it

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,240
makes business sense for Suzy to do that

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,970
kind of thing to you know show leap as

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,890
an entry for a you know potential

00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,950
customers entering their sleep world so

00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,890
I hope so I expect it I can't guarantee

00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:21,310
they'll do it but you know I'll push for

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:24,760
it okay in that case I'd like to make a

00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:28,360
request to the board to request that

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:32,880
Sousa consider openSUSE as a strategic

00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:35,880
partner just like they do with HPE IBM

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
etc

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:43,480
I think in many ways they already do but

00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,870
if you want a badge on a website

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,500
well we already duh it's not visible

00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:53,470
really this either visually orally at

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,960
any of the events you see nothing about

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:59,290
what you see very little about openSUSE

00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,850
it's only because Doug's hijacked corner

00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,920
of a table you've hijacked corner of a

00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,210
table at one of the events this is our

00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,250
sponsoring that you're attending I'm

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,660
gonna run up and Reyes is raising his

00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,330
hand but I will say if you go to the

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,880
open SUSE open source section of the

00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,140
Sousa page they did change it recently

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,060
so they've got like all the communities

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,530
they support and like we're just like

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,920
the massive one in the middle that has

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,720
color and all the rest done so you know

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,700
a different way of reflecting it but

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,080
yeah you got a point oh I'll look into

00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:31,410
it I just wanted to comment back on what

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,390
Andrew was saying with regards to HP and

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:37,390
the way that I understand it in a non

00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,700
official statement is that partners are

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,580
investing money in order to build those

00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:44,380
alliances with Sousa with openSUSE it's

00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,600
exactly the opposite way around says

00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,680
Sousa is investing as a sponsor in the

00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,680
openSUSE project

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,970
as a guy whose team is working with

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,829
these partners what I can say is I would

00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:07,150
consider openSUSE especially the fact

00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:11,000
that we are using factory and leap

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:14,869
development to springboards less means

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,859
that the openSUSE community is directly

00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:21,849
contributing to celeste we take from our

00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:24,410
partners not just revenue but also

00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:26,390
engineering and testing resources etc

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,030
and I find that what pursues it falls

00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:35,240
directly in that so I find it a valid

00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:36,859
request way of course but this is just a

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,390
marketing thing it's it's about

00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:41,599
marketing I see no reason why we

00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:50,510
shouldn't be marketing that I'll do what

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:53,420
I can to actually have two questions

00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,700
regarding or one comment the things I

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,890
saw on my mails back shares already

00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,480
there I didn't saw it for openSUSE

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:05,359
support that might follow what I

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,819
actually want to know what I want to

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,569
refer to the title of the talk of duck f

00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:14,359
of tax Oreo future this what openness is

00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:16,460
what you make it so we have this request

00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,970
of the board now forgetting a metric

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:24,589
server and regarding the heroes I can

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:26,900
tell you this is a tough task maybe so

00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:30,050
if anybody here is experienced with

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,810
metrics or wants to do that task step up

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,849
to it and I want to consider everybody

00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,819
who wants to use this support mail at

00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:40,520
rest or pack mail address before doing

00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:43,880
that maybe try to also consider if you

00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,339
can contribute to the buck in the build

00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,079
service which might make even the

00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:50,780
distribution better and not only is

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,240
filing a park and forget about it which

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,250
is even better than just filing a buck

00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:00,160
of course this caution is always good

00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:03,260
but we should get a distribution better

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,440
I mean I think the wiki we want to

00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,560
create - so where you should track the

00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,450
things is exactly for that

00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,400
at the moment is not that easy to go

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,990
with your issue somewhere because maybe

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,590
you know what to track them but I don't

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:20,720
know if everybody knows so that I mean

00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,850
that there was idea of the wiki exactly

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,350
what you are saying trying that people

00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:30,140
find the place was rocking since and the

00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,220
support mailing list exists myself and a

00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:37,370
couple of others on the border already

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:40,760
subscribed and primitives we before

00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:43,340
asking about volunteers to set it up and

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,730
so on or even if on theory we do it we

00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,680
wanted to hear some feedback that's why

00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,260
so it is not something decided we are

00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,930
going to use it's a proposal and before

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,790
going to set it up and nobody use it

00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,850
then we want to hear what people think

00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:01,250
and also on that no one on the board is

00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:03,710
gonna set up matrix no one on the board

00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,090
is gonna force any of the heroes team to

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,100
set up matrix that's that's alright

00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,560
power we have very much just bring the

00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,930
idea out there and if a volunteer steps

00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,020
up and does it then it will be done if

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,270
no one does it then it will be too hard

00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,510
and it won't get done and we will use

00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,190
the relay server that's slide so

00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,990
actually that's cool because there are

00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:26,990
concerns from the community about

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,970
communication on how get new people and

00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,560
people that are not used to use IRA see

00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,690
and things like that and then we were

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,240
discussing about along with automated

00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,080
could be a good alternative but it's not

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,700
decided so

00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,230
yes it's not decided it's up to the

00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,490
community to decide and then do

00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:51,140
something if that worried you just say

00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:52,970
Derek's so I can tell you one thing what

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,330
will happen somebody will step up set it

00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:59,180
up and then say yeah I'm out CEOs have

00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,590
to keep running I can name you at least

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:04,760
three things right now which you are

00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:06,380
heavily using and if I got promises oh

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:13,050
no no in a month we would turn it off

00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:24,700
and it's the running so yeah

00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:27,670
experience another topic there was the

00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:30,850
the topic of how to go about replacing

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:33,280
the open fate system and the suggestion

00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,320
I heard was to create a wiki page and on

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,380
that wiki paid lists where for

00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,900
individual packages we we can request

00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,760
features my suggestion would be can't

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,160
remove that information into the build

00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,710
service so that this can be maintained

00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,420
directly alongside the packages are not

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,790
as a separate source of sorry

00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:54,640
so I'm my simple open suzer answer to

00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:58,060
that is yes we can if someone does it

00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,850
but the thing with the build service

00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:03,970
Bugzilla integration is it creates a bug

00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,860
on openSUSE not a bug in gnome not a bug

00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,930
and KD if you would like a new feature

00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,900
in Gnome really it needs to go into

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:14,200
whatever place that gnome features go

00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:18,040
and the only sane way of doing that

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:19,480
really is to have a wiki page that the

00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,040
people who want to use information can

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,510
add misunderstood misunderstanding here

00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,070
as well because when we speak about the

00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:31,060
project I think we are speaking about

00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:32,980
like OBS or saying open QA so I mean we

00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:38,220
are not only speaking about the project

00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:40,270
inside so open build service and so I

00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,690
mean if you look at like the current

00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,040
like filing a bug in openSUSE page you

00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,440
know you've got the generic one like how

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,720
to file a bug in the distro and then

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,010
like any asked and then in this part of

00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,020
the distro and then that part of the

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,010
distro and whatever but also if you

00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,630
think about it we have an umbrella

00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:59,020
project you know where do you file a bug

00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:59,740
or a feature for OBS for awesome for

00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,340
open QA

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:06,190
and I think that progress so like that

00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,800
that with this kind of joint topic of

00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,300
bugs and features it's kind of you know

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,950
a joint effort to document all of that

00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,100
of course you know we're not gonna try

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:18,490
and have one grand unified feature

00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,970
request place for every single openSUSE

00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,970
project

00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,600
yeah it was everything about all the

00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,060
openSUSE umbrella periods are not about

00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,220
all the packages in the distribution yep

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,550
so I think again the right problem

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,110
addressed

00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:50,960
I wonder how this process of reviewing

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,930
that would then look like I mean with

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,820
the Fate it was I think suffering from

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,100
two pinpoints first ever no people

00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,140
stepping up and making the decisions

00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,390
like no open hole opens ooh the

00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:05,000
community will never do that and second

00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:09,290
that from a technical perspective its

00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,590
clunky see yeah this one is an easy one

00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:14,810
because other than someone who wants to

00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:17,030
add something to a pattern for example

00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,220
which is actually an open Caesar feature

00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,600
and if you want to do that annoy me

00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,940
create a bug request then we'll see what

00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,710
we can do for everything else whether a

00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,080
feature added or not is that it or not

00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:30,350
we really believe is a decision for up

00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,690
screen so if you want to request some

00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:35,600
fancy feature in gnome we really believe

00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:43,910
that is for upstream to go for and

00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:45,620
that's not for us to carry okay meep no

00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:46,040
it's we meant to say it's about

00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,550
everything

00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:53,000
maybe I as a user do not really

00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:55,730
understand and don't know any side of

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,040
the point parts I'm the point I want in

00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,660
my Souza system on my computer I have to

00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,930
school out here I don't even know that

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:05,120
it's actually leap and rad this would

00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:07,160
come from what project is apart and all

00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:09,350
these things so I like the idea to

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,120
handle something on the side of openSUSE

00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,820
we as a communicate care for something

00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:16,490
but then how is this like triage so that

00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,550
we can separate it so the point of the

00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:22,310
wiki is that it is the best way that we

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,650
as the board can handle this and try and

00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:26,690
direct people in the right direction of

00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,160
where their features should go but so it

00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,950
would be the board making Detroit ring

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,600
and we can help them yes we're gonna do

00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,710
it initially and then everyone else can

00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,970
update it

00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,400
there is another thing you can't rock

00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,650
you see the issue for the users but if

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,990
the developers don't read it then it is

00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,089
completely useless so I think it's much

00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:47,740
easier for the developers to track the

00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,740
issues where they are already working so

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:56,660
I just want to say like one important

00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,660
fact of being a packages is also being

00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:01,369
the bridge between your end-users and it

00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,710
might be an integration your issue in

00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:05,750
the desktop but also upstream giving

00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:09,170
them feedback this breaks in my next

00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:11,089
version or something so I think having a

00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:14,240
package I pick up the back and then

00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:16,970
forwarding it to and this is really part

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,240
of the workflow yeah we want to document

00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:21,890
that when that is true there's you know

00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,780
in the non packages scenario that isn't

00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,430
necessarily true so yeah what we're

00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,080
thinking along the lines of and I've

00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:30,109
been told we're running like 15 minutes

00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,670
over so any other questions can go to

00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:35,450
