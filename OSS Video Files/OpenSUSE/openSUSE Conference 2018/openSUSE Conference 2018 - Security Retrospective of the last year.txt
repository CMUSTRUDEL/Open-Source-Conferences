Not just Meltdown and Spectre

Last year was a quite busy year on the security front, various big issues
happened, so its good to tell what security has done there and is doing for
openSUSE and SUSE in general here.

The talk will give a brief overview of how the SUSE Security Team works
and operates. We will look at the reactive work including statistics,
and also look at proactive secure development lifecycle activities.

I will also highlight some of the big security issues we faced over the
last year.

- Stack Clash from mid of 2017.

  Overview of the problem, what we do for mitigations, and our long way
  for compiler mitigations.

- Meltdown and Spectre

  As we hoped never to have a StackClash like issue again, CPU sidechannel
  issues surfaced which needed kernel mitigations begin of January.

  I will give an overview over what these issues are, and how
  we mitigated them or are still mitigating them.

I will also talk about one of my projects done in the last year:

- Full PIE enablement for the distribution and its long road to Factory.
