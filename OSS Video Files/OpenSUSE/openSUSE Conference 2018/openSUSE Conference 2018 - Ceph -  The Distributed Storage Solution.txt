You want to learn more about distributed storage solutions and in particular about Ceph? In this talk I would like to give you a quick introduction about distributed storage and Ceph at a glance. What is it? Why is it useful? Why do I need it? Isn't a single NAS system suffiecient?

Ceph’s foundation is the Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS), which provides your applications with object, block, and file system storage in a single unified storage cluster—making Ceph flexible, highly reliable and easy for you to manage.
