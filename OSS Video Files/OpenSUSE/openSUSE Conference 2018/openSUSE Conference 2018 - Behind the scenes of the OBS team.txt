Tools, processes and procedures used by the OBS team

If you ever wondered how the OBS gets developed, this talk will provide some insights into how the OBS development works including tools we use (e.g. depfu, hakiri, codecov) and workflows we follow (e.g. Scrum).

OBS developers have also changed a lot in the last time. The OBS frontend team has doubled its size within the last 2 years. We will explain how we brought everyone up to speed with techniques and methodologies such as Scrum and mob / pair programming.

The reference installation build.opensuse.org is now also OBS frontend team responsibility. We changed the deployment process by introducing a demolition squad role. Beside build.opensuse.org, we also release OBS regularly and are in charge of quality assurance using e.g. openQA and Kanku.

Last but not least, we will cover how you can participate in OBS development, both as a developer and suggesting changes and features.
