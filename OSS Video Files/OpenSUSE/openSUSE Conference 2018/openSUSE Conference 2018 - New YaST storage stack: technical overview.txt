YaST comes with a brand new storage stack. The packages libstorage and yast2-storage have been replaced by the new libstorage-ng and yast2-storage-ng. YaST team has put a lot effort on having its new storage ready for openSUSE Leap 15 (and SUSE SLE 15), and now it is time to present how it works. In this presentation we will explain storage-ng from a technical point of view. For example, we will discuss the current algorithm used by the automatic proposal: how it decides what devices should be removed, how to configure its behavior and how it works in several scenarios. Also, we will see some details about how AutoYaST uses and interacts with the new storage stack. This talk is a good opportunity to get feedback from the openSUSE community, and we can discuss how our tools can be improved in future.
