TLS 1.3 is the brand new version of the SSL/TLS protocol.
The draft of the standard was recently approved by IETF and it will be published as RFC in a couple of months.

TLS 1.3 is a big redesign of the protocol which brings substantial changes such as better security or handshake speed-up.

The talk will present its new features as well as compare the new protocol to the previous versions.
It will also focus on the status of openSUSE, for example how are the web browsers, common cryptography libraries, and applications doing with regard to the TLS 1.3 support.
