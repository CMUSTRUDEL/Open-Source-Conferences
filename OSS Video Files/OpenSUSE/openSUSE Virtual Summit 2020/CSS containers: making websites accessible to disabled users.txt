css containers making websites

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,840
accessible to disabled users

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,679
some more information on this can be

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,040
found on my website

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,160
john r hudson dot me dot uk

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
slash computing

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,640
my personal background is that i learnt

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,279
about page design

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
as a student journalist when i

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,920
encountered micro computers

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
i first used them to save time but when

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,600
i encountered

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,640
vector graphics i realized that you

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,360
could use them for quality output

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,879
in the 1990s i found that i could

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,640
support a blind student

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,520
through my use of a computer

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
the wider context is the cascading style

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
sheets

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,480
were first proposed in 1994 and adopted

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,320
by microsoft netscape and opera

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,640
but they fell out of favor in the first

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
decade of this century before being

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
re-adopted

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,879
as part of the redevelopment of html in

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
2011.

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
this redevelopment was proposed by

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,760
mozilla apple and opera

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
who surveyed the ways in which websites

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,280
were being designed

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
and concluded that five elements were

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,560
most likely to appear in a website page

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,040
a header a footer navigation links

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
links to tangential content and the main

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,759
content of the web

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,479
page david fisher presented these five

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
elements

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
known as the semantic elements

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,840
schematically at a meeting of the

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,880
bradford linux users group

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,960
in 2010 when he described the work which

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,840
mozilla apple and opera had been doing

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,119
from a user's point of view as screens

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
had become more oblong

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,040
rather than square putting the

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
navigation links and the links to

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
tangential material on either side of

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
the main content

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
reduce the distance the user's eyes had

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
to jump back to the next line of the

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
main content

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,159
from a developer's point of view the

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,840
html code

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
became more readable and easier to

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,080
maintain

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
in 2008 the web content accessibility

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,120
guidelines had been published

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,640
and work had begun on the yre attributes

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,480
which were formally adopted by w3c

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,920
in 2014 as part of the

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,239
redevelopment of html some html tags

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,319
had had their functions redefined in

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
ways which reduced their ambiguity for

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
screen readers

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,599
for example the eye elements lang tag

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
attribute could alert the screen reader

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
to a change of language

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
however browsers still placed elements

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
on the page

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
in the order in which they appeared in

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,080
the html code

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
so a screen reader normally had to go

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
through all the navigation links on each

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
page

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,840
before reaching the main content

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,239
some developers adopted the work around

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,560
of adding a link in the html code before

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,560
the navigation links which allow the

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
screen reader user to jump to the main

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
content

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
by setting the line height of this link

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,080
to one pixel

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
it is invisible to cited users but

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,080
readable by screen readers

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,360
if you view catherine fletcher.info in a

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,200
white browser

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
you will see no mention of the link

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,080
skipped to content at the top of the web

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
page

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
but a screen reader presented to the

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,519
user

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
i have found that very few websites use

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
this workaround

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,599
and in about half of them it does not

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,879
work presumably because the website has

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,519
been updated since

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,799
it was first added and no one knew to

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
update the link to them

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,000
at the same time one

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,319
problem with the recommendations for the

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,879
placement of the semantic elements

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,680
was that there was no way in 2011 of

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
anchoring them in place on the web page

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,959
and screen readers still presented the

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,760
navigation links before the main content

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
then the html main tag appeared rather

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,480
mysteriously

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,519
to be followed by css containers

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,560
these come in two flavors flex and grid

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
as the css documentation revealed the

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
new

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
main element was created to hold a css

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,000
flex container

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,120
which anchored the navigation links the

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,280
main content

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
and the links to tangential material or

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
the aside

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
on the web page

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,639
within the flex container the html code

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,440
to be set out in an order which favored

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,919
screen reader users while in the css

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
file

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
the order property could be used to make

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,080
the material appear in a browser

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,080
in an order suited to cited users

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,199
the complete css file for the

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,040
heatholdboys.org.uk website

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
demonstrates the use of the semantic

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,800
elements and both a flex and a grid

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,440
container

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,440
in the lines beginning main to section

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,800
the first line main open brace display

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,160
flex close brace declares that the main

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,400
holds a flex container the next three

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
lines declare that when the article nav

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,600
and the side elements are children of

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
the main element

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,120
they should have these particular

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,280
properties in particular

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
they should appear in the order nav

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
article underside

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
in a browser even though they do not

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,919
appear in that order

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
in the html code

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,960
we can see the result of this in what a

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
screen reader user hears

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
perhaps a few too many welcomes at the

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
start of this page

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
but otherwise straight into the main

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
content on

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,479
on the page with no navigation links to

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,479
step through

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,479
the body of the html code starts with

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,720
the header

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,440
followed by the main element including

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
holding the css flex container

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
in which the article element containing

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,639
the main content of the page

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,960
appears first near the start of the

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,280
article is the school crest

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
which has the aria attribute role equals

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,560
presentation

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
this tells screen readers that the image

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,960
is not referenced in the main content

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,680
but is merely there for decoration

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,520
a sighted user however sees a web page

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
in which the navigation bar is on the

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,840
left of the main content

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
the crest is there as decoration and

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
list of recent additions

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,199
appears in the aside bar to the right

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
for this particular page the sidebar

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,759
follows the article in the html code

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,000
so once visually impaired users have

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
heard the main content

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
they can re hear about the most recent

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
additions to the website

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
before hearing the navigation links on

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
other pages the navigation bar follows

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
the main content

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,800
in the html code

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
though intended for the benefit of cited

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,599
users rather than visually impaired

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
users

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
a grid container is used to create

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,720
columns where previously there had been

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,800
a long list of links

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
for example on the obituaries page the

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,039
website

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,479
the line beginning section in the css

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,680
file declares a grid container

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,440
grid template columns auto auto

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
says that the grid will consist of two

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
columns and that these columns will be

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,199
sized

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
automatically justify content space

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,599
around

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
says that the columns will be spaced

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
evenly with a half space

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,240
at each end

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
as with flex controllers screen readers

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
simply read the content of the grid

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,240
container

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
in the order in which it appears in the

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
html code

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
so a stream reader user hears the first

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
column

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,199
followed by the second column whereas a

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
cited user can immediately see in which

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,560
column to search

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,479
for a particular obituary without having

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,840
to scroll as far as they would

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
if it were a single list

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
to summarize the con flex containers

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
change the dimensions of elements

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,520
automatically in one direction

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,639
horizontal or vertical

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,960
to suit a device and its orientation

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
grid containers allow items of different

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
widths and heights to be placed

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
asymmetrically

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
and to change their placement depending

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
on the dimensions and orientation of the

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,520
screen

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,639
the example given none of these extended

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,639
features were used

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,640
of course you didn't have to use css

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
containers in the particular ways in

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,000
which i have done

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
but they do offer a great deal more

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,800
flexibility in the design of web pages

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
so the same web page can be equally

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
accessible to cited

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,399
under visually impaired users

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,399
used with html elements like time which

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,120
offers a machine readable time and date

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,480
stamp

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,480
for screen readers and with the i alum

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
element and the lang attribute which

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
alerts a screen reader to a change of

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
language

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,720
and with the new css voice properties

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,279
which allow you to specify the gender

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,360
age speed and so on of the voice which

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,360
the screen reader uses

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,440
the experience of a visually impaired

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,440
user can be greatly enhanced

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,399
