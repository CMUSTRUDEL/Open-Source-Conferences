ten should be there anyway thanks for

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:29,279
joining us and coming back and so go

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:33,469
ahead and recently I switched this way

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:37,380
and decided to use this as a Weiland

00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:42,540
like way the compositor intentionally

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,719
trying some new tech just for fun yeah

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,230
and you can see right now I hope the

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:54,420
video is playing how it looks like on my

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,100
setup and this is the talent went well

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,469
and compose I the compositor means that

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,280
it's arranged in Windows and special

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,180
weather etc is quite people-centric

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,390
you can use Mouse as well if you want

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,610
but as a developer in engineer I would

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,030
like to switch my keyboard between the

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,600
windows workspaces and running the

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,400
applications visit so talent windows

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,920
managers are working five with me and

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,890
they tend to be lightweight you can see

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:33,570
some terminals notifications and even

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,729
state status bar before click status you

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,729
interested in speed between workspaces

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:49,320
so I started it as my personal exercise

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,970
and just to set up my environment as I

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,500
wanted some kind of lightweight

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,909
lightweight setup

00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,909
norm was little bit too

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:07,319
have it for me so I thought why not me

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,410
why not and also wanted to see what is

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,810
the status of Wayland and actually I was

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,030
well I was using Wayland before I just

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,360
didn't notice it until I tried to share

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,120
some of these like presentations of goto

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,349
meeting and then I found out that ya

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,180
even know in tumbleweed year ago Dave

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:35,340
Eiland was working finally even didn't

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:39,480
authorize it so that's why I actually do

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:44,970
know that and yeah it's working really

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:47,629
fine ever seen is in factory that you

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,370
need the minimal set up for like valent

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,709
definitely in factory and other packages

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,440
like sway VM and all the basic packages

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,420
so there so you just can install it and

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,829
some of the packages that are

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:07,319
development you can install from the x11

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:09,989
valent development project on OBS so

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,299
it's easy as like installing suede its

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:16,500
create the valence session automatically

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:19,819
for you and if you use G DM as the DM

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,590
problems well Gil appears the session

00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:28,530
possible session me or like in Dropbox

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:33,980
and you can all linking this way just

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,980
just use grants way from there your tty

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,200
way bar if you have C you have seen in

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,690
my example that I use paper instead of

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,900
sway bar so a bar is the basic one and

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,720
it's comes this way it's like the whole

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:53,760
sway idea is to be a replacement for I 3

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:58,470
and 3 bar 3 replacement but Way bar has

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:03,359
their more functionality or statuses who

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:05,370
integrated his other stuff yeah you can

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:10,370
click a lot of things and have different

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,170
events on it as well as Styles etc

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,360
they're like four well are there a lot

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,220
of different tools to implement what you

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,950
actually used to like notification etc

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:27,560
with all the custom tools they are call

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,560
for verification you've seen in my

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,389
example that our student issue for

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,230
Thunderbird same works for telegram

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:39,690
jeans jeans is actually a little bit

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,850
different I don't know why but telegram

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,320
rocket shot emails really working fine

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:50,580
bothy you also seen that in my

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:55,070
presentation its launcher it's called

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,340
launch anything with searching all the

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:01,740
executables or you can search on desktop

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,750
and that's will show you only those

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:09,720
application that has desktop fastened

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:12,479
work more like a menu and VF recorders

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,640
that's what the tool that is not and

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,600
working the whale record in are not in

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,080
the factory yet developer submitted in

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,240
factory there's some work to be done but

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:32,310
that a tool that I used to record their

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:36,060
presentation they begin configurations

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:39,180
yeah a lot of this is they noticed the

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,419
people are saving in the dot files and

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,169
that's really beautiful there is there

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:48,390
article on the openSUSE news about how

00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,229
to manage dot files I can recommend it

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:56,130
and I also also have my own dot files

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:59,010
for this presentation that's the way I

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:03,539
name it and you can look into my

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,630
configuration what is open so the way

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,000
you doing this exercise I thought okay

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,240
maybe that will be useful for anyone

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,490
else if they're like users of a3 that

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,229
want to switch or maybe people want to

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:22,770
try it by themselves it may be a good

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:27,389
idea to have some kind of structures

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:30,389
instructors to follow to have such kind

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:39,330
of setup or maybe the general openSUSE

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:41,819
way and yeah so I created project for

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,639
myself to solve the issues I have is

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:47,490
they set up and maybe branded a little

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,330
bit that it will look like openSUSE out

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:56,370
of the box so if they if there is

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:59,729
interest just in such kind of stop

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:05,220
environment you might create as well the

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:08,970
installation for it so yeah I'm open for

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:13,289
that and good health and is already the

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:17,940
only think there is maybe can fix and I

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:21,240
will mention that nature I mean designs

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,889
are really customizable like almost of

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:29,310
the application I like way bar sway

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:33,270
velocity wise like they easy

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:36,270
customizable with the CSS styles so we

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:42,539
can make them look and feel how we want

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:50,159
and made it like for destroyed of the

00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:52,469
box looks openSUSE way can fix yes way

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,500
and very powered a sports like disco

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:59,430
conflicts on under ATC you can put some

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,340
kind of predefined profiles there but my

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,680
new boss applications somehow do not do

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,479
that they always look into the computer

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,219
about configure director they should

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:15,090
look out for the people and yeah

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:19,729
so if there will be wish to create some

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:23,039
kind of this is a desktop from this

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:27,240
these problems have to be solved as well

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,710
as a lot of I 3 and way uses they tell

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,330
to maintain the old can fix right and

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,790
shift

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,210
just register from machine to machine

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:41,810
use those for easy installation and if

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:47,630
somehow I can solve for myself and

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:49,040
father house before that so this is

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,620
merge confused

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,540
sorry that will be always most

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,370
experience for just clip type off

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,710
buttons around couple of comments and

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,930
they have the destroy this they're all

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:10,280
configs and whatnot yeah so I created

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:14,440
the project this is just for myself

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:18,530
we're tracking watching dissolve and

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:22,160
this is my hobby project to create the

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,870
cool environment to myself if you wish

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,290
to join now you have some suggestions

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:32,420
you are welcome to join and create card

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:36,100
issues so pursue the way desktop-based

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,200
of a VM and Wayland could be really fast

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,530
desktop environment and that will look

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,070
like

00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:48,770
openSUSE and run a smoothie on tumblr

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:50,720
within three fast questions that's

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,950
actually F was quite quick on my

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,380
presentation let me come come back and

00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,460
show you how that works once again so

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:05,570
here you see a open couple of the

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:09,650
terminal windows is just shift entry not

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:13,370
50 robust with Windows key enter a lot

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,950
of key buildings over there and arriving

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,380
couple of applications inside the

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,930
terminal

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:26,060
all with my keyboard and then I hadn't

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:29,890
run the demeanor this this is a wharf a

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,080
launcher that abuses menu door

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,470
application launcher where you can lunch

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,420
implication by searching and this mouse

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,560
that's also possible to do everything

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:47,000
close in running applications and etc

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:53,150
and right now I'm clicking after this I

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,890
will click now on the volume button here

00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:00,160
in Weber that's I tuned it to open the

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:05,210
controls for the sound and you see the

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,220
notification for my son so I use their

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:12,040
multi monitor solution so I have three

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,040
monitors I can show it here really well

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:20,180
but I use multi monitor solution and

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:24,520
that works pretty fine for me I have

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,520
different workspaces and I can switch

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:33,740
but I really do designers so I just just

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:39,260
try try to some sleep that sneaks like a

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:43,010
Suzy Suzy but but yeah I really bad in

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:46,640
designs CSS files so you can find the

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:53,450
project under the openSUSE way and there

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:58,100
you can find as well there this the

00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:03,290
project and the config files that I

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:12,770
created to customize the square a little

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:17,690
bit and so way by the self have really

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:20,210
cool documentation and I forgot to

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:24,550
mention it or I think I have link

00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:27,620
somewhere here before I created also the

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,620
[Music]

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:38,630
wiki page for it it's on my demo but you

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,850
can also go here go ahead here and I

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,390
created some of the documentation how

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,710
you install it how you configure your

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:52,520
working manager

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:55,960
location launcher and cetera yeah that's

00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:59,030
more less eat what I wanted to tell you

00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,800
questions and while you have some

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,810
questions I will play this video and for

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,090
those guys who do not like talent

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:14,630
managers for Welland there some Weyland

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:19,160
native composer that looks like that so

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:31,180
yeah that's that's mostly guys any

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:36,100
questions I've got a question around

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:39,950
Weyland in general I'm just wondering if

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:56,900
what is related remote desktop solution

00:13:39,950 --> 00:14:00,430
available for that yet there was a

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,430
question not sure if you've heard it

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:07,840
so can you repeat the question please

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:11,920
yeah yeah hi it's Patrick

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,670
so the my question is in general with

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,590
with Weyland

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:24,260
is there a VNC or RDP solution so people

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:26,480
can get support remotely available yet

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,400
because I've been looking around for it

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,800
for a customer and we can't really seem

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:48,080
to find anything that works consistently

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:50,120
all right make sure I did I know that

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,610
there's the people are talking about an

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:58,460
RDP that can work as an RDP server and I

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,600
haven't yeah I haven't really seen that

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,819
working yet

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,009
it seems to be featured and in

00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:09,649
everyone's distributions but it doesn't

00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:12,860
seem to work so I haven't tried it by

00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:16,399
myself but I have seen the round that

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,750
they did something with it see and

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:33,470
actually in the context of sharing the

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:35,980
screen and create additional so yes so

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,490
creating the multiplication is writing

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:47,560
user sessions but I really don't know

00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:52,670
how that the application name associate

00:15:47,560 --> 00:16:00,040
but if you give me a little over there

00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,040
somewhere I will try to look up and

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:26,720
yep I had initiative questions but

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,220
you've already answered and Dennis

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,080
during the presentation one was

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,000
notifications and I see it working just

00:16:30,080 --> 00:17:05,990
fine and the other one was sharing your

00:16:32,000 --> 00:18:23,170
desktop here just shows that it's okay

00:17:05,990 --> 00:18:23,170
