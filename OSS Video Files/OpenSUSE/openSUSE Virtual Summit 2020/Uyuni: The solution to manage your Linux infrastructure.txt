let's see only that so what is your uni

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:14,099
uni is big big application that you can

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,300
use to manage your super defined

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,039
infrastructure I am the product owner

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,220
I'm thinking project manager of Suzy a

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,619
manager which is the downstream of uni

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,250
it's actually the same thing as you uni

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,390
but with commercial support from Souza

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,759
in previous lives

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,820
I was Debian developer the KDE developer

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,590
and I also participated in more projects

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:45,739
I can be found in IOC Gita and email I

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:49,320
will go Souza since almost the years ago

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:52,980
so reunion it's a systems management

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:58,340
solution you can use it to deploy and

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:01,280
Pat and Audi it invent or all the usual

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:05,159
stuff you want to do when you manage

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,530
tens hundreds or thousands of systems so

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,400
if you have ten systems and servers you

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,650
may be able to do it by hands with some

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,840
scribes is eight automation but when you

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,520
have a thousand servers ten thousand

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,259
servers fifty thousand servers you

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,220
definitely need something that means you

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,110
arrive easier and that thing is you need

00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,689
also the configuration management you

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,990
can keep the same files on all your

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,210
systems synchronized with one click and

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,000
it also does virtualization it's not

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,280
nearly as powerful as OpenStack is for

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,560
instance but you can think of it of like

00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:49,049
some build manager on the web the

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,990
architecture of the Uni is the classical

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,930
several client architecture we have an

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,090
uni server you have the clients and in

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,750
the middle if you have a lot of systems

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,759
or if you have remote sites you may want

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:08,069
to put proxies proxies are essentially

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:12,940
cache cache servers they they do catch

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:15,400
the packages configuration files some

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,690
stuff but all the management the Indian

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:24,670
goes to the server all the commands now

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:28,090
what does when you come from the in 2010

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,880
Sousa took the spacewalk project from

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:34,540
Red Hat which was the upstream for Red

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,390
Hat satellite 5 and painted green

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:47,080
adapted to Susan systems and contributed

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:50,020
to two space walk around 2018

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,530
the city will spacewalk was well not so

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,770
good

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,710
Red Hat had decided to to deed satellite

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,670
five in favor of something else called

00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,380
Foreman Katella Paul they split

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,230
satellite in or spacewalk in several

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,910
components and went with that that's the

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,580
the base of the coroner had satellite

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,430
six we on the other hand continued to

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:17,290
believe in spacewalk and at some point

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:20,950
in 2018 we forked it so for the past two

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:24,510
years we have had these four go of his

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,489
face wall which is called the uni and

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,989
well as Facebook will be dead in a month

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:35,830
exactly well twenty nine days now and

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:40,209
it's quite all this missing so where

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:42,760
does the name or uni come from but one

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:46,800
of the key components of uni that was

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:50,500
not possible to put in with spacewalk

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,880
while at the local 12 we had was asphalt

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:58,050
the modern automation framework so salty

00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,810
unis the largest salt flat in Bolivia

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:06,130
you can see them where this comes from

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:10,090
so we do you need we have made incisor

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,100
very easy does there's still the

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,680
traditional stack so if you like the

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,859
space well you will love with uni and we

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,540
have this more modern stack which is

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,880
salt

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:26,680
most of our of our new development is

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:30,310
salt only so for instance rail eight or

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,100
rune to only wall so debian only works

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,960
with salt minions which is not bad in

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,169
fact it's it's pretty good because it

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,550
adds a lot of new features but if you

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,949
want to migrate for instance from

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,500
satellite or a spacewalk you can keep

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:48,310
using traditional stack and it will just

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,550
work with space well we have a we live

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,130
we uni we have added integration for

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,300
containers variant is we are working a

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,930
lot of scalability

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:03,789
currently we are aware of users with

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:05,770
50,000 servers even more than that we

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,350
have worked a lot in terms of usability

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,830
we have modernized the UI with a new

00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:16,600
react UI which is also a single page

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:21,550
application UI and we have also moved

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:27,850
from Python to and Java 607 to latest

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:30,130
version 2003 and Java 11 so these are

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,440
the classical features that you can also

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,750
find in in space walk you can do systems

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,620
appointment you can do patronage man you

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,440
can do the service pack migration stuff

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,990
you can do configuration management so

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,470
specially DC with files vision files you

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,710
can do bare metal provisioning with

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:54,130
kickstart on to some degree without to

00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:58,120
us you can ask a little simple act on

00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:01,060
chains or systems you have the openness

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,750
cap and CV outlet that's pretty good

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:08,020
also and you have of course the API in

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:11,830
XML RPC API now what have we added with

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:15,940
you need we have transparent integration

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,710
with salt which means you do not need to

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,130
know in many cases that you're using

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,530
salt behind the scenes you can manage

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,229
with the same tool you can manage on

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,419
premise cloud hybrid cloud multi-cloud

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,030
system so we don't have one solution for

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:36,700
clan social for on premise but you may

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:38,530
have with some other tools you have this

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,450
new feature which is the content

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,910
lifecycle management

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:46,660
which allows you to define projects and

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:49,870
stages for your server channels to match

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,000
your environments is really useful for

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,940
instance if you want to make sure that

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,250
you evolve the packages or the solver

00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:01,390
that you distribute and you can also use

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,160
filters to add or remove contents it

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,650
also allows some nice features like for

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,690
instance if you are using related to

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,300
sent away as a tour one of the welcomes

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:15,100
you can take a modular repository and

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,370
flatten it into a normal repository you

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,530
can also design a recent feature that we

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:26,130
added recurring actions you can say okay

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:28,960
every second Saturday at 3:00 a.m.

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,600
deploy all the patches or all the

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,880
packages from this server channel to all

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,040
these systems and you can select what

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,520
systems you want to to deploy this over

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,490
- you don't need to do this every week

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,070
or every time just schedule it forget

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,840
about this you can build operating

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,700
systems and container images okay images

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,770
you can also you have these compliance

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,080
features the CBL is cap you can also

00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,900
suppress elysium match your systems to

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,890
make sure that you know you are not over

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,470
subscribed or undersubscribed it also

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:10,420
works on the cloud by the way the the

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:13,570
usual suspect Amazon Azure and and the

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,120
Google cloud also with VMware and

00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,360
OpenStack we also have these abilities

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:23,590
and management features using KBM and

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,330
and then the ability to hosts we have

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,490
integrated their primitives and graph on

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,430
a stack for monitoring including

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:34,990
Federation in case you have many sides

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,790
or many systems and one server is not in

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,350
all one primitive servers not enough or

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:41,890
you can all you want to surprise

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,020
concerns Federation is made easy we also

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,430
have dashboards for all of these we have

00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,700
a very cool feature which is called

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,790
formulas with forms so if you look at

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,260
the salt dogs or where a salt guide you

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,970
will see that in order to use salt

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,700
you create the safe formulas it's like a

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,970
playbook comparable to the unseeable

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,670
play books now is with the uni we have

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,960
these Yama files that this will create a

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,880
UI you don't need to to be able to

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:14,450
develop software it's just a Yama file

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,430
where you take the the the stuff that

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:19,580
you need to feel or the parameters that

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,780
the soul formula will need describe them

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,750
you can even add some validations and

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,340
bam it works and then you get a UI no

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,870
programming skills requires a style

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:36,560
editor so where are we with uni so all

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,660
the the code is all public and we

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,450
discuss in public we have the Uni

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,760
develop the unique users we first commit

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,590
everything upstream so you go to a

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,400
github project you will find the code

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:52,520
before you even arrived in the reporters

00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,160
that later will be released us to the

00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,310
manager we have IOC and we are also

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,660
trying either to reach more users that

00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:03,590
may feel that I have seen is a bit

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,590
difficult to use our CI is probably for

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,830
the results we still it's not possible

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:14,240
to see all the details all the results

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,220
of the Jenkins jobs because that runs

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,800
internally in Susan we are looking into

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,410
a solution that for this to move into

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:28,460
the public cloud currently a uni is

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:32,660
available for openSUSE leap 51 will move

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,770
to 15 - as soon as it's available and we

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:41,360
support kind of a ton of clients I have

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:44,390
tried to group into families but for

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,610
some reason PowerPoint is breaking this

00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:50,000
is very essentially it switch about

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:54,670
every person obviously since 11 also

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,980
open Susi 42 and 15 rel from 6 to 8

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,980
Center where's Oracle Linux is less

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,780
expanded support something called spring

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,450
daily news that I only learnt a couple

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:08,290
of months ago is a another clone of rel

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,259
by Princeton University

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,199
they have we have received recently got

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,439
community contributions for Fedora 1331

00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:19,959
client tools and also Neal my guess is

00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:23,290
in the audience he's trying to build you

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,589
need to run on on fedora we have

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,939
personal support for Amazon Linux - I

00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,249
said partial support because we are able

00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:31,989
to deploy packages but we have some

00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:37,509
difficulties mirroring it because Amazon

00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:41,169
Linux uses SQLite metadata instead of

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:43,389
the normal xml metadata that RPM

00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:47,319
reporters usually use and we also

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,359
support ubuntu from 16 we will add a win

00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:51,369
to 2004 in the coming weeks and

00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:53,769
naturally we will make in their release

00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:55,959
that we have a unit that will resume in

00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:59,259
a couple of weeks may if you not it will

00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:02,919
be available next month in the to

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:04,660
release debian 9 and 10 also arrived

00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,889
recently as a community contribution

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,649
support his own path to win - and one of

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,359
our russian guys from russia at the

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:17,289
support for something called a storage

00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:21,600
or l which is a russian distribution as

00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:24,129
a debian fork and also it has some

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,209
passive support only we have also some

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:31,809
difficulties mirroring the packages but

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:34,089
it is will improve of course as you can

00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:39,339
see we support a lot of operating

00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:44,829
systems symma slight but uglier and

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:49,089
better organized at least okay why do we

00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:52,779
have okay now you will notice that i

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:54,730
have talked about monitoring releases so

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,609
for the past three months or four months

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,350
we have been receiving once a month we

00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:03,909
units a rolling release we don't offer

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:06,609
support for past versions so if you come

00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:09,189
to me and say wow this is failing within

00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:11,199
20 2003 first thing I will tell you

00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,739
anyone will tell you in the mailing list

00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:18,779
is updated a to the newest version 2004

00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:21,560
in two weeks to 2005 the abdic braid

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:25,070
process is really easy just the

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,330
up it doesn't require anything special

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,690
we have been working on making the

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:34,190
process smooth so for instance in the

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:36,410
coming release we will also add

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,380
automatic migration of the date of the

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,580
schema which in the past required may

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,130
not a step no more when we move to

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,040
openSUSE leap 15 - we will move from

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,910
process equal 10 to 12 that will also be

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,760
automatic automatic nicosia then we'll

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:59,240
save a lot of travel and this is the

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,510
upstream forces a magic furrow since a

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,550
couple years ago it's as said it's

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,310
identical D'Souza matter but all you

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,680
need is only Community Supported while

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:15,110
in Suzy manager you have this support

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:18,260
from Suzie what's next leap 15 - as a

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,700
base system we have not considered jump

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:25,640
yet I don't know if we will ever use

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:29,630
that I have we have simply not even

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:32,089
discuss that we'll see maintenance

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:35,930
windows this something that is rather

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,310
useful also because we want to avoid if

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,900
you'll see that mean you want to avoid

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,400
for instance is scheduling something

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,400
during production time during working

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,790
hours so with Windows Windows then we

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,210
will be released probably in June you

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:54,230
will be able to say ok I can only

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:58,160
install packages or pet systems from 10

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:02,300
p.m. to 6 a.m. and that's all happened

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,680
you can only schedule jobs to start in

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,020
in those hours cluster management this

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,030
is a really nice feature even in the

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,940
current rules of uni you are already

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:16,459
able to manage to some degree curate

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:20,029
these clusters it works even better if

00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:23,870
you use the suzerainty decision classic

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:25,990
ASP socially it prevents you from

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:32,180
breaking your cumulative cluster

00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:35,240
essentially but with the next respawn in

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,760
June also it will send

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,709
making into the male release of uni you

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,779
will be able to say okay you I want to

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:44,089
deploy a new current disclosure I want

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:46,520
to deploy a new self Glasser and with

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,580
one click it will happen I want to

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,930
upgrade my whole class sir and that's

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,180
exactly what will happen

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,339
I want to reboot my whole class and then

00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:59,930
the auto sector will kill it will kick

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:01,940
in and start draining the nodes and all

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,630
of that that works in collaboration in

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,810
close collaboration with the with the

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,820
let's say the clustering target so it's

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,820
not like we are reminding how to drain

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,060
safe nodes or curate these clusters we

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:21,260
work with the creditors excavators and

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,630
we work with ACEF we just drive it and

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,680
make sure that we follow some policies

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:30,800
that we have after long discussion with

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:36,140
all of these or all we also work for

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:41,480
this s for H a what if you have more

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:43,790
than 30,000 clients that we know that

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,370
working it maybe work maybe works for

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,470
even more than 30,000 or if what if you

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,310
need to have separate sides and you want

00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:56,329
to be able to fully manage all your

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,010
clients connected to to the sides with

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:01,339
the current architecture with the units

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,839
one unit around several unit proxies you

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,189
will not be able to that because the

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,100
orders of the commands come from the

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:11,449
unit server but we have something called

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:15,410
the hub the unit hub that orchestrates

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:19,699
that all so far we have the happies

00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:23,600
available as a as an api only filter you

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:26,360
can already from the xml-rpc api have

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,400
several uni servers and from the half

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,690
server you will be able to orchestrate

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,240
that so i can again send commands from

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,700
the hub disconnect the servers for hours

00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,320
or days and it will just happen I don't

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,490
need to be connected more usability work

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,559
and said we have worked on the

00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:49,010
installation part on the upgrade path on

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:52,130
the UI part we will keep improving

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,770
and we want also to translate we unit

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,230
into several languages currently we have

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:59,330
I mean if you try to use a uni in a

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,270
language which is not English you will

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,280
notice that some strings are missing and

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:06,560
some strings don't really make sense

00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,550
that's because we hate it that

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,480
registering from space walk but we have

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:18,650
not updated them in a long long time

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,380
we want to revise that and to have also

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:24,320
their documentation translated at least

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,870
the installation part is upgrade the

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,790
client configuration guides maybe not

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,920
the administration guide which is quite

00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:35,300
big what the reference guide which is

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,870
huge and probably not enough food as I

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,170
started but for more advanced users and

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,350
of course want to build the communities

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,270
now something that comes up usually that

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,150
I saw when I was in Debian when it was a

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,830
kiddie developer is I want to contribute

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,510
to the community to uni I want to

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,420
conceive this project but I don't know

00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,050
where to start well if you don't want to

00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,690
code you can just do translations the UI

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,370
documentation it's pot files just

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,850
contact us on the mailing list because

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,120
not all of it is already right well it's

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:12,830
ready but not easy at this moment you

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,460
can also help with learning pills

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:18,890
articles videos quickest are guides you

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,230
can take a soul formula from upstream my

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,370
face is to install a Samba or configure

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,470
some server and web server

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,570
authentication that recently came in

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,020
mailing list and then a form that just

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:31,910
yeah mail file there's also some

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,920
interest in the community on how also

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:37,130
Debian and Debian based distributions do

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,790
not have this concept of Rada that rpm

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,280
based decisions have but this it's

00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,950
possible to emulate this and this gives

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
in the community so this can be

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,850
implemented we are missing out

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,750
installation suppose we have kickstart

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,730
and we have yes

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,280
also yes and we have something called

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,900
Yomi which is a salt based but we don't

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,360
have anything that works with Debian

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,940
which could be addressed by implementing

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,690
proceed support or kickstart support

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,249
which will

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,220
probably the easiest way to start

00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:10,190
accessible for Debian we have some

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,999
support forums only nukes - but we

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,149
cannot import SQL metadata one way will

00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,039
be to add SQLite metadata support into

00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:23,029
reporting the other way will be to just

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,679
combat SQL Lite - XML maybe beautiful

00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:29,330
host gathers for your favorite cloud

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:32,539
orbital ischium platform or something

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,599
more difficulty you want to get serious

00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:38,059
into coding GPT key management container

00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,440
mirroring and staging which we cannot do

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,210
we can build containers but we cannot

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,379
mirror container public registry for

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,059
instance or more real traditional stuff

00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:49,669
Microsoft Windows I love that that's my

00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:52,249
pet project I have a if you go to my

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:55,309
github I have a branch of the unit where

00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm working on that and not yet there

00:20:55,309 --> 00:21:02,869
but not that far either or we have some

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,359
editors or a file viewers in the UI

00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:08,090
wouldn't it be cool if it acquired

00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:11,330
language server protocol support and

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:14,570
then I will be able to highlight when

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:18,830
something is broken in the in the when I

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:22,039
make a typo or use a wrong commands like

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,019
that or even create my own dashboards

00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:26,239
because currently we have static

00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:29,359
dashboards and say you cannot change

00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:31,220
them but would they be cool to create

00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,679
your own dashboard kind of what you can

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,659
do with graph on but the more integrity

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,549
not taking data from the database

00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:40,519
without the need for a Prometheus

00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:45,229
exported for all of that now how do we

00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:47,539
install uni really is it just can't leap

00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:49,849
I had even revelatory and this solar

00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,759
pattern or you can download an appliance

00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:56,739
already made appliance from these Oviatt

00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:59,450
repository think of you uni

00:21:56,739 --> 00:22:01,879
important you need a fully qualified DNS

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,590
or the clients will not be able to

00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:07,009
connect because the SSL certificate will

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,599
fail in these wiki page either gonna be

00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:15,580
hard to do these easily for with it with

00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,680
rebuilt then

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,290
for leap you need to install something

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,540
called Swissvale utils and run visual

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,070
comment channels to add the channels you

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,140
will notice there are tons of channels

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,370
for all the operating systems that I

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,120
described and even the ocean

00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:33,010
repositories then this is robust part

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,460
ripple sync you need to mirror your

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,160
packages now we have made that six

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,660
hundred percent improvement in ripple

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,140
sync that will be part of the next

00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,270
series of in May so it's much much

00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:51,280
faster now essentially it goes as fast

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:53,830
as your downlink and goes and also going

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,830
this is one of the usability stuff that

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,390
we improved recently if you need to

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,280
create these boots our repository which

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,230
contains the initial packets the minimal

00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,930
set of packages to register a client

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,230
that's gone it it just works

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,030
automatically now you probably want to

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,520
create an activation key incision key is

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,810
something that brings together the few

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,120
channels that you want to subscribe a

00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,760
system to few configuration files and

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,570
some parameter you have three ways to

00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,110
reduce our client the web UI if you want

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:29,110
to only do one so a few currently you

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:32,290
only can do that one by one you can also

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,870
create a bootstrap script which you ran

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:37,240
from from cloud for instance or you can

00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,750
do the do it the in Reverse you saw the

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,420
assault minion on the client system

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,280
system and then configure what the

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,170
server will be and on the server side

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,970
you will get the request to accept the

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:54,640
key the lip of this repository already

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:58,270
includes patch information which will

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,910
also be used for audit and here we have

00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:04,030
a matrix with all the supported features

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:07,150
you can ask us in IOC your guitar if you

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,930
want to learn more details a full

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,230
training course

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,330
Sousa has released the three materials

00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,430
for the deployment anything confusion

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,490
which it's called deployment a single

00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:20,910
finish abut goes as far as content

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,580
lifecycle management so it's very good

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,980
material you will want to watch this to

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,260
get serious with the Uni for Center

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,320
where same thing users need to

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,880
use an external service to get the

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,920
errata because Center West does not

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,950
provide the errata in a way that you can

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,610
download it's fully documented how to do

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:45,460
this in the you need ox and also their

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,570
support metrics this is these are a few

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,330
screenshots how this looks you can see

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,780
that it's a rather big here for instance

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,080
I run a command and LS on our system and

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,330
I can see here the output when it was

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,020
executed and everything as you can see

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:08,110
here the quite a few features so there

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,760
are many different use cases for uni

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,620
here you can see for instance the

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,870
patches for centre wells that I

00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:18,400
synchronize using the similar service

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,820
and usual questions they get Center

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,190
wells

00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:26,440
it's it supported essentially everything

00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:30,730
even app streams which do not work with

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,860
a spacewalk and in in the release coming

00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,540
in in two weeks you will also be able to

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,900
pick the app streams from the UI

00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,270
currently you need to type them easily

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,970
available sent away snow if someone from

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,620
the community contributes it we will

00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,890
gladly accept and we are able to help

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,620
but Susie will not do that kind of uni

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:54,970
managed Microsoft Windows not yet my pet

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:57,580
project you want to help come to me and

00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,330
you can also join us so three minutes

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,330
