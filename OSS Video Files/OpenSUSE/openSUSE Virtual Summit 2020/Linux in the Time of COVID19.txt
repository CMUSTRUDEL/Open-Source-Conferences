	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
when when this whole covert 19 things

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,480
started happening we thought well this

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,849
is a great you know this is a great

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,230
solution if you've got a lot of money to

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:19,560
spend and and a lot of time to build it

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,750
and and do the planning to say reload or

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:29,039
your or your Windows machines to be

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:32,369
linux desktops but there was no there

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,350
was nothing sort of that was filling any

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,899
of the requirements that our customers

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,960
were asking us for so for example we've

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,000
got a customer that 20 or 30 users in

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:49,309
fact this is actually their air

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,510
management system and they've got linux

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:58,680
desktops on which they run an RDP client

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,770
to talk to their cloud-based windows RDP

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,500
servers and now suddenly they couldn't

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,780
go to their offices so the standard way

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,850
that I know a lot of other service

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,030
companies are doing is saying well just

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,710
buy a laptop and stick build your RDP

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,110
there put your RDP client on it and

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,049
connect to your window server and

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,250
everything's fine except you have a lot

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:29,390
of a lot of companies have they've

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:33,090
engineered their remote access solution

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:36,720
to the tune of say 10% of their

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,119
workforce requiring it because the sales

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,130
staff and the management staff and

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,950
certain members of staff would would

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,659
always be running remotely whereas your

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,200
back office staff would never be working

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:53,159
remotely so doing working in that

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,270
scenario you end up with a whole bunch

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,060
of problems

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,399
some of them being machine related so

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,009
hardware related either is there enough

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:07,500
other enough cause in this the CPUs that

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,369
are running your Windows or your your

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,540
Linux systems

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,530
is there enough memory to manage this

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,810
incredible upswing

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,220
of users that want to connect to your

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,310
service

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,500
is there enough even if there's enough

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,670
bandwidth or if you've got enough

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,260
licenses from Microsoft to to manage the

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,760
that you know the massive increase but

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:36,150
also how many people have you got on

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:40,650
hand to manage that kind of explosive

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,770
growth in connectivity and to talk talk

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,010
through the process of installing the

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:50,489
software onto someone's desktop or works

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,380
or a laptop at their home in order to

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,340
them to give them connect back to the

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,920
main systems of course then that

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,770
introduces another problem which is with

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,440
staff bandwidth and staff bandwidth the

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,420
way you've done you've got a whole bunch

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,870
of people that you know need this access

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,820
but you your limited IT staff can't

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,900
can't deal with that and did not have

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,670
people to service all your sudden

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:23,060
newfound native requirements for your

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:27,840
staff um for even stranger is the

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:32,970
realization that your your staff some of

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,100
them don't have computers at home some

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,730
of them the only place they touch a

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,290
computer is at work because they're

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,829
their experience of computing is via a

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,590
handheld device their mobile phone or a

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,390
tablet if they're lucky most people you

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,310
know there's a whole new generation of

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:57,680
people that their only experience of of

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:00,120
computing is via a handheld device so

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,360
going back to what our clients were

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,489
wanting we have this one a couple of

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,950
traditional clients and we had them

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,519
already running their their workloads in

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,650
in a cloud environment they didn't

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,370
necessarily have connectivity from home

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,100
so that the call was on to get everyone

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,430
connected remotely that was going to end

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,970
up being across a number of customers

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,130
a hundred hundred hours two hundred

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:35,880
hours of work just to get everyone

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:37,530
connected properly and that was going to

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,820
be a bit of an issue and I thought

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,860
there's got to be some sort of work

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,600
there's some sort of open source way of

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,210
doing it

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,490
and that's where I was doing some

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:56,009
research for a remote access for another

00:04:47,490 --> 00:05:00,599
customer and they are using they've got

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:04,560
they using leap and they do fluid

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:06,090
dynamic the fluid dynamics calculations

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,660
and software they write their own

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:13,199
software and some of their customers are

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,310
in aerospace Formula one you name it and

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,380
they're heavy-duty

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,690
users and they wanted a high performance

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,729
solution and we came across a number of

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:26,460
them this is the one that really struck

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:28,380
and you know really left out of me which

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,690
is called a pallet Apache you cuacamole

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,800
us and there's anyone heard of this is

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,960
familiar with this if this package you

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:46,310
can unmute if you want to unmute and

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:51,510
towing it's essentially it's a a proxy a

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:54,810
proxy server that you can connect to

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,240
your Windows systems to your Linux

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,550
systems your RDP systems and you know

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:07,050
VNC and SSH systems needn't tell MIT and

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:10,830
then suddenly you access that your your

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:16,169
work from anywhere because it's all

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,820
web-based it's a simple login looks like

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,680
that

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:23,909
and once you're logged in this is a live

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,490
version this is what it looks like and

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:29,509
these are the most recently connected

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,740
systems unless let's go to the customers

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:38,010
RDP server

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:39,840
and so I could remember there there is

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,130
an old part of the administrator

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:57,080
password I could probably get you in

00:06:41,130 --> 00:07:02,840
quite quickly and I'm not sure what the

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:05,660
performance is like for everyone there

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,760
that's about half they user a state or

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:14,850
three-quarters of their user of state

00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:18,870
running right now and we just want to go

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:24,090
use the browser key but back to the back

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:33,720
key it takes you back and you can go and

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:36,560
look at say a system monitor which is

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:43,040
this is actually the guacamole server

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,420
that is running the remote access for or

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,730
for those users and for what we're

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,470
looking for we've just logged into so

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,150
it's actually not doing anything this

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,820
and this you look around here and

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,880
there's there's almost no utilization

00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:00,480
and you've got you've got a six or seven

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,060
people working we've never seen it go

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,030
above 15% even with a hundred people

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,230
connected to it so it's it's pretty it's

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,700
very very low low touch in terms of CPU

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,490
usage

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,620
I remain I mentioned this in this

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,140
conference because when I tried to build

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:24,990
when I tried to look for these packages

00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:28,200
inside done inside the software it sees

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,450
that openSUSE org I couldn't find them

00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,130
there was one someone had built them but

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,170
they didn't work properly and none of

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,350
the integrations were working so I had

00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:39,440
to build it build it by hand so I'm not

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,169
that good with their building rpms or C

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,910
C files but once I did do that it

00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:51,700
works a treat you'd spend say probably

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:58,420
15 minutes putting together the Apache

00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:03,040
configuration so you can see here at the

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,329
top of the screen do you you could all

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:12,519
go to that and you'll see that that's

00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:15,579
that's the SE URL it's it's super simple

00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,529
no plugins were required on any custom

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:20,260
or any client machine that you connect

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:27,940
it works on mobile phones it works on

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:30,120
the iPads Mac's Android devices Linux

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,769
you know it it all runs everything

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,709
everywhere it's quite an amazing thing

00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:38,019
so how this session really is a call

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:41,980
outs like we get this built and included

00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:43,510
in leap as a and actually into into

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,970
openSUSE because they weren't oh sorry

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:51,420
into into the Susan Slayers packages

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:57,459
because it is an awesome piece of

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,779
software that it should so no concerns

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,529
you should be leading the way in terms

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,690
of covert and in recommending this the

00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:06,360
other thing that it comes with which I

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:10,660
can't really show you but there's a

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,380
there is a it comes the whole bunch of

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,839
different means of authentication

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:20,620
including something called viewing and

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,089
yuo is CSUN as recently being bought by

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,790
Cisco it's a two-factor authentication

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,899
provider and it one of the things that

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:36,069
this comes out of the box with natively

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:38,050
so it's completely secure and extremely

00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:40,449
high-quality open source code that is

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,720
solving some of my customers problems

00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,720
right now

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:56,140
and that's kind of really all I wanted

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:57,800
to to to to raise and to discuss if

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,370
anyone's got any questions

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,920
please feel free to ask I did have more

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:07,430
to present but it's been a long day and

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:14,029
I've been busy but I'm make the whole

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:25,640
conferencing system work which we

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:38,709
appreciate it's been interesting any

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:38,709
questions that's a very old slow system

00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,200
who's who installed that it wasn't me

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:08,629
I believe that this a lot of this is a

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:11,329
lot of this work was done with with the

00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:14,300
I think a lot of this is built into

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,430
things like OpenStack a lot of the codes

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:23,410
been built into - stackin thing and

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:23,410
projects like that management of systems

00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,579
those those packages that you said you

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,949
found and on software that openSUSE

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:42,189
norica but they were so they were just

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:44,660
built homebrew builds yeah yeah and I

00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:47,449
did I think I haven't checked for a

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:50,269
while but I've installed I've said I've

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:54,259
asked a question and I think anyone's

00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:59,029
responded so I just built I just

00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:01,550
downloaded the the the source builds and

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:09,500
built about it by hand

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:13,730
I can't I'm not so much of a see an RPM

00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:18,759
development fanatic that that means that

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,689
I can know how to build an RPM and

00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,569
compiler properly and have it

00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:26,600
supportable but I know that there was a

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:28,850
big push by by Caesar to come up with

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,829
something and I'm not sure if it

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,129
actually came if they come up with

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:35,750
anything that was really that

00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:39,019
interesting I think it was just a copy

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,970
you know sled plus something and a lot

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,490
of the other solutions that people have

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:51,319
come up with in require a in integration

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:53,149
and and actually had sweat blood and

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,120
tears to try and get something working

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:58,220
that will work for the customer but this

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,529
is the easier by far the easiest thing

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,889
to do I was literally up and running

00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:10,009
with this within two hours and able to

00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:15,639
provide people with a URL to point to to

00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:15,639
connect and and start working remotely

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,870
maybe a one question yeah so when I was

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,910
setting up

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,340
I guess ref since we are talking about

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,600
it in you know it had that position

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,600
since we are talking about it in the

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,550
chat one of the changes was actually to

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,460
set up the entire Active Directory and

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,530
basically the infrastructure so I can

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,140
get this easily working otherwise just

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,090
you know installing and deploying the

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,000
ref was not that difficult once you had

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:50,060
the infrastop is there some complex

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,830
infrasonic or does it just work out of

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,850
the box with some simplified login

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:58,180
mechanism cuz it a number of it's a good

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:02,840
question actually there are number of

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:09,890
ways you can go about it the easiest way

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:16,480
is which is the way we've done it is is

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:19,790
to have a simple log on so for example

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,500
this is one user and this one user if

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,830
you know they use a known password will

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,060
get you into into all these servers but

00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:34,640
you still need to get onto those servers

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:36,590
in the first place so it's it's a it's

00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,260
not necessarily that secure but you you

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:42,050
in the way we've architected it in our

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,600
cloud is you end up in a they store a

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:49,430
waiting room wedding for to give access

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,130
to for example that Windows system now I

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:56,870
had to log onto that so you can get if

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,540
you can get onto that you can build it

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:03,220
that way which is the easiest way

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,570
there's a static static means of

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:11,000
authentication

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:13,100
there's the duo solution which is

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,030
two-factor authentication so you have to

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,980
have a a key or an app on your mobile

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,010
phone that logs you in

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,880
I think the integration two ways to

00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:29,820
authenticate with with from

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:33,839
with Active Directory one is you have to

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:40,100
install your an RDA an Active Directory

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:42,660
schema so that guacamole wall effect

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,880
will have its own little bit of schemer

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,980
in Active Directory which a lot of

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,160
Active Directory administrators would

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,230
never like and they would never allow it

00:16:49,160 --> 00:17:00,480
or alternatively there is a solution we

00:16:52,230 --> 00:17:03,540
build a Postgres database with a level

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,709
of you know a few I guess an application

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,870
on that I haven't gone that far I've

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,300
gone this this far and that's that's

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:17,490
been good enough for my customers okay

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,850
thank you yeah the documentation is

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:26,010
really good and there's lots of it

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:33,840
lots of good scenarios and what-ifs on

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:35,490
this site and that tells you it tells

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,920
you everything and it's a its Apache

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:46,830
what can be wrong with that so they talk

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:48,179
now about those old out there is zero so

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,350
there's lots of different means of

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:54,950
authentication so you should be should

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,950
be okay with that

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:12,120
if anyone what's want any assistance to

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:15,480
deploy it I'm very very much available

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:19,500
to to help if people want follow it take

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,510
a look at using this provided of course

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:30,350
someone helps me build it build it

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:30,350
properly on on the openSUSE build system

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,760
any other questions

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:58,030
well I think that's probably about it

00:18:53,530 --> 00:19:01,630
I'll put everyone to sleep they say it's

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,760
a long long any CEC some people from you

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,260
know different places where you know I

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,860
mean since some could be put me to sleep

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:15,910
don't worry wow that's the kind of

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,679
feedback I made when I've got lots and

00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,160
lots of people bitching about the the

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,679
the conferencing software but actually

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:28,050
it's what's what's good is that there

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,580
are more people bitching about about the

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:34,780
unmuted microphones than they are about

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:38,550
the product but actually the unmuted

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:43,390
microphones is my fault so there you go

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:50,380
that wasn't meant to work properly no

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:52,720
that's it's been a long day but you know

00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,160
I think simply doing it on the system to

00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:03,640
is is also quite good is well you know I

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:13,750
mean open mics is always an issue with a

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:18,840
lot of things politician exactly exactly

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,840
and some that don't even care anymore

00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,730
well then the next step on the schedule

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:36,429
looks like we have Neil he's gonna be

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:44,860
doing a talk about I guess how they're

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:49,090
using OBS at dotto again you know very

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:53,920
sponsors we have so also I layers of

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:56,800
sponsor so very much appreciate

00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:02,070
of all the people that have taken part

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:06,610
in this so I guess we could probably

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:11,290
exit and then go into Neil stock yeah

00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:14,710
exit stage left everyone thank you for

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,880
thank you for listening in and see him

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,880
