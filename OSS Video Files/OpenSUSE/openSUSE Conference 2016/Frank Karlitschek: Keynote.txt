vice president of KDE he's also the

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,300
founder of own cloud and next cloud and

00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:31,880
I think we're all interested in what he

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,880
has to say today so please welcome Frank

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:43,800
thanks thanks a lot great so many people

are here and then the first talked this

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,610
morning and first tour is always tough

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,829
especially after than the second day of

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,860
a conference or thanks for thanks for

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,379
coming yeah Frank Otte Jake is my name

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm doing open source free software for

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,460
a long long time it's getting close to

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,680
20 years now so yes I'm old I know

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,320
started with Katie eat a lot of KDE work

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,549
started projects like the open desktop

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,260
or network the open pc project also the

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,509
integration is to open through the build

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,450
service or the open build service with

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,470
open desktop for a while but I think

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,720
nowadays I'm mostly known for four

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,950
founding own cloud and also founding

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,750
next cloud it's possible that some of

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,280
you are here to hear a little bit of the

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,799
background what's going on here but I

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,500
have to disappoint you so this is I'm

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,720
not going to talk about any any any

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,520
drama hear that because this is not fun

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,740
we want to avoid it I want to talk about

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,479
something a little bit more visionary

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,820
and mom as an outlook of by the internet

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,450
is going where free software is going

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,549
how clouds and the Internet what's going

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,710
on here and what we all can do here so

00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:03,060
but all I have to warn you I want to

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,250
make this talk a little bit more

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,009
interactive than usual so I'm going to

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:12,280
ask you questions so be prepared

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,959
I hope you are you're awake okay so the

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,110
topic of the color of this talk is

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,819
fixing the internet with free software

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,099
obviously a little bit provocative I

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,140
want to talk about first why it needs

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,549
fixing what's the problem with the

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,890
internet I mean we all use the internet

00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,440
every day and I think it's safe to say

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,810
that we all wouldn't be here without the

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,700
internet I mean without the Internet's

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,769
not I can't imagine how something like

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,290
linux linux kernel order or

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,730
distributions like opensuse could be

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,709
developed without the internet so

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,500
obviously this is all this is very

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,190
important so interesting about the

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,829
internet is that it started

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,750
decentralized so at the very beginning

00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:58,180
the internet was an project that was

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,230
driven forward by our universities and

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,489
research institutions all very

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,799
decentralized and I looked up the

00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:08,230
definition of the internet is the first

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,629
sentence of the VIP dia entry it says

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,180
the internet is a global system of

00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:15,310
interconnected computer networks so you

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,620
can already see that internet is not one

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,889
thing it's a connection of different

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:24,870
networks so it's all very distributed

00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:27,639
and of course also the very first

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,859
service providers and protocols and

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,629
services and applications and so on this

00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:36,069
is all basically very very distributed

00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:37,989
so what is distributed or decentralized

00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,930
what does this what does this actually

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,900
mean so I want you now I have the first

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:51,220
question any opinions what distributed

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:59,220
or decentralized means more things can

00:03:51,220 --> 00:04:03,010
failure true yeah yeah it's true yeah

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:08,079
yeah true here more opinions what is

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,599
decentralized can you repeat it can you

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,530
repeat what you said oh yes exactly

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,900
outside of the company yeah so

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,310
independent from a single company I

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,150
think you are the different entities

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,419
involved here other opinions what is

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,419
decentralized

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:32,130
loosely coupled loosely coupled yeah

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,949
exactly that's a very good point so I

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:38,770
think what we can say as sort of summary

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:42,340
is that this isn't there is no central

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,169
instance there is no central server of

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,060
the internet there's no central hub

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,060
there's no central cable there is no

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,760
central Central company it's all very

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,590
distributed and decentralized for

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,320
everything for everything there are

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,940
multiple providers most of the stuff you

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,639
can host yourself or you can go to a

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,600
service provider or hosted in your

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,940
university or wherever you want but

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,880
there more than one service provider

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,949
it's not like I don't know AOL or tea

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,060
online at a time where it was clearly

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:15,639
only one service run by one company

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,410
another thing is usually you have you

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,570
can choose between different server

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,850
software so if you want to run something

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,979
like email there's more than one email

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,199
server on this planet so you can choose

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,270
between different ones and that's the

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,060
same for clients they are more than one

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,430
client for email on this planet it's

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,580
also part of it and of course what it's

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,280
not not strictly part of decentralized

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,289
but it definitely helps a lot most of it

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,650
is free software so the free software

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,750
open source implementations for the

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,060
operating systems Linux obviously the

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,419
network's take the the service of the

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,680
client software and all this together

00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,400
basically means that this is

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,680
decentralized so decentralized services

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,139
at the beginning as i said the inter

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,389
that was very decentralized that someone

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:09,520
has examples of decentralized services

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:11,770
on Tintin imats on web service yep yeah

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,530
the web of course exactly a biggest

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,889
service probably other services that are

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:23,659
decentralized

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,659
named services yes of course email yeah

00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:31,050
okay i'll email not gmail that's

00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:34,620
different not a lot of people know

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,259
nowadays that this is different yet okay

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,629
so services i think email was one of the

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,689
very first services email is

00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:45,270
decentralized because i can run an email

00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:48,060
server at home i can go to a service

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,520
provider to get email i can run email at

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,360
my university or company or whatever and

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,039
i can choose between different server

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,500
software i can read with different

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,960
clients and the important thing is we

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,909
can all all we can all damn send each

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,969
other email all right so i can send an

00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:08,909
email for my my local email server at

00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:10,860
home at my raspberry pi to someone wears

00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,539
a gmail address and this person can send

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,400
send the email to accompany this all

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,400
works together because they're open

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,009
standards for head and the same for

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,409
usenet or news right you have if you

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,710
remember its i don't know if it's dead

00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:27,330
or zombie state at the moment I think

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,969
but the one of you were a little bit

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,339
older as I am know that at the time at

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:34,979
University they were running new service

00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:37,710
service and you can access these new

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,419
servers and read news and post news and

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,550
they are then distributed between your

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,680
different servers so this is all also

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:49,110
though it's decentralized and intent

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,699
yeah federated is he of course the same

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,259
they're different servers at different

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,389
lines I'm repeating myself as you know

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,589
it's open standards we can all talk to

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,689
each other the web was mentioned

00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:59,509
obviously very popular there's not a

00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,879
central depth serve on this planet

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:04,610
everybody can run a web server and

00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:09,120
linked to each other so it's distributed

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:12,089
XMPP is relatively new it's also an

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,159
example offer of a distributed messaging

00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:20,699
service okay so that's all good great

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:23,520
yay problem is nowadays there's a trend

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,139
to centralized services you might wonder

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,149
why this is a problem and come back to

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,139
this in a second but I think this is a

00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:35,209
trend which is not not so good as

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:37,550
has significant problems so one example

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:40,360
is filed soon can share but this is

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,950
basically the idea that you can

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,930
synchronize a file it on your phone to

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,060
your desktop and shared with someone

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,430
else and then access it from your tablet

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,459
from your work computer and so on and

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:55,130
this the popular services here are like

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:57,350
Dropbox and Google Drive and Microsoft

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,100
onedrive and this is a centralized

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,769
service because it exists only once this

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,740
the software is not free that's the

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,140
service of the end a client software and

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:11,329
it's yeah you have a complete log into

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,579
this too is one vendor but that's a

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:16,040
problem at the example our social

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:19,579
networking that's you know most popular

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,500
facebook twitter google+ and so on also

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:23,899
exists only once it's completely

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,959
proprietary we have a lock in it's not

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,750
an open service veet your voice I mean

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,490
that Google Hangouts the skype and so on

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,019
so also very very closed messaging

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,449
service is actually interesting because

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,699
as I said there is something like XMPP

00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,649
which is actually distributed but super

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:44,510
popular if you talk to the young people

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,100
nowadays and look at our phones you can

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,290
see they're running like 10 different

00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:54,890
messengers and they are all they're all

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,959
centralized here's a picture this is how

00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,339
it looks like you have one thing in the

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,130
middle you can call this a service

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:04,610
provider or software or the cloud if you

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,970
want and you have different users

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,339
connecting to the central instance okay

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,550
so what's the proper amounts or nice I

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,320
mean it set before if a big company in

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,690
the u.s. runs the service is probably

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,310
very stable and doesn't fail right it's

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,910
very centralized they have a big IT

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:25,519
departments all very good okay so what's

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,050
the problem first of all this is an open

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,089
source and free software conference here

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,740
right and all those services are not

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:33,529
open source and not free software I

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,329
think this on its own is already a big

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:40,069
problem the second problem is the cost

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,100
this might sound strange you might think

00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:45,530
that what's the problem here drop

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,590
I get a few gigabytes for free and it's

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,090
all very cheap and what's the problem

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,240
well if you really synchronize a lot of

00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,890
data if you have gigabytes and terabytes

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,150
some companies and research institution

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,860
has a lot of data you want to

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,980
synchronize that then it suddenly

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,130
becomes really empowering expensive so

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,990
cost is a is a problem and of course

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:09,260
with these consumer services you usually

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,240
pay with your data so if you use Google

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,340
service which is often free like hang

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,620
out but you have to give up the data of

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,620
your privacy and control over your data

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,860
and this is what you pay for my speech

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,810
speed is another thing you might think

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,000
yer I don't have a problem synchronizing

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,950
right my libra office files what's the

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,020
problem well if you have a lot of data

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,600
if your synchronized you complete hard

00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,830
disk everything your own and

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,750
synchronizing means copy everything

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,480
first from your local hardest to the US

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,480
and then back to your phone because you

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,600
want to watch a movie then this is a bit

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,240
strange and then speed is an issue legal

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,220
issue is obviously right i mean the you

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:56,000
especially in germany a very strict

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:57,950
privacy and data protection laws so copy

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,620
everything around the globe first is

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,090
interesting not always a good thing and

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,960
then of course the question is peg

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:08,180
dawson and espionage right no one knows

00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,650
what kind of backdoors this big service

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,260
provides have in their code no one knows

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,290
because its proprietary intent this is

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,660
all secret but it's an interesting

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,550
question right these entities are

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,680
basically of control of a big part of

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,290
all the data on this planet then the

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,180
question is is a valid one who has

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:31,550
access to this data okay so what can we

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,610
do what can we do here and of course

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,170
also why should we care and we are doing

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,700
linux here and doing this opensuse

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,710
distribution that's all fun why should

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,780
we care about the internet well I think

00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,850
we should care because as I said at the

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,710
beginning we all wouldn't be here

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,350
without the internet the Internet is a

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,500
unique opportunity for everyone on this

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,400
planet here for really free and

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,230
distributed communication infrastructure

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,360
to exchange knowledge to talk to each

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,350
other so this is all very critical so I

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:11,880
think we should care so what can we do

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:15,810
so different things fixing step one step

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,870
one would be free software so what do we

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,970
do well we have free software people who

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,210
easy we start on a free software an open

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,920
source project if you listed here H

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:30,960
Explorer nowadays called called PI do

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,940
then owncloud of course cozy cloud see

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,130
file there are a couple of free software

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,990
open source projects that basically

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,880
implement and I'm talking about file

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,540
sync and sherea implement this

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,240
proprietary services as open source okay

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,270
so first problem fixed yay great

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,040
everything is open source now well if

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,820
you look at this picture here then you

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,440
see well maybe this is my my Raspberry

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,720
Pi at home with a few people from my

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,390
family and then this is a company and

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,130
this is a service provider and this is

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,980
all good and this is all open source and

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,960
very very fast and you can look at the

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,850
code and host it was a aware your one

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,620
that's all good but as you can see

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:15,510
already well now we have a lot of

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,730
islands I mean here we only have one

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,560
thing and basically everybody on this

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,870
planet connects to one central instance

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,680
which means sharing data here is very

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:30,600
easy but if you basically if you have

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:34,440
that then well we have a lot of islands

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,980
and we are all very secure here but also

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,350
very isolated so that's the problem and

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,660
this was basing the state of the files

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,420
in which a free software world like two

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:52,230
years ago roughly so first part fixed

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:56,340
but not really okay so we need to do

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:59,250
more fixing step 2 this is what's called

00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,000
Federation so this is basically the idea

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,520
that hmm maybe this ireland's here maybe

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,209
they can talk to each other and this is

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,220
this sound strange at first

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,929
but if you compare it with other

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,389
services that as mentioned at the

00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,189
beginning like email for example well if

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,470
this is my email server here and this is

00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:21,139
like Gmail and this is like open suse

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,269
org we can all tell each other emails

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:27,319
and this all works because we have an

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:30,319
open protocol called Adam called smtp so

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:32,059
this all works works together here so

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,990
why is not possible to have exactly the

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:37,790
same for file exchange so that's

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,639
basically the idea with Federation you

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:44,449
can have lots and not like five but

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,490
maybe five million or 50 million servers

00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:49,309
on this planet and they can all talk to

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,860
each other that's the idea and this is

00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:53,929
like I said Federation and this is

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,809
implemented by own cloud or the by next

00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:59,119
load up I do have a few dots here I hope

00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,490
that more projects join this initiative

00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:03,889
and implement this open API it as an

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,999
open standard it's documented and this

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:09,619
already works today ok so we can already

00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:14,360
basically connect all those service

00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:17,860
together ok so how does this work in

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:22,069
reality this is here a screenshot I

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,259
didn't want to use some well-known

00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:29,079
software here so i created the opensuse

00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:29,079
cloud here as you can see it's green a

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:35,509
here are my documents so if I want to

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,129
share something I can click on it and

00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:42,230
then this share dialogue here opens and

00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:44,240
he has his input line and this input

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,929
line i can type in a name and this can

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,949
be someone on the same server or and

00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:51,980
that's the special thing about

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:55,149
Federation I can tape something I don't

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:59,029
know if you can read it username at at

00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:02,059
example here alright so this basically

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,470
means and this is the syntax is very

00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,959
similar to other services you have a

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,970
username at and then the hostname same

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,240
way as email right where every user name

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,459
and you have a hostname or XMPP Chapur

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,839
same you have a username and a hostname

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,149
this is usually hot federal how

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,640
federation works it's exactly the same

00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:23,060
if i type in here Frank at

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,970
Frank's superglued calm then this server

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,500
here sends a request to my servants a

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:31,880
header is his user called whatever Frank

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,190
also wants to share with each other

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,350
Frank do you want to accept that new

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,780
click yes and then those two servers

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,790
that communicate in the f is this shared

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:46,520
connection between them as you see on

00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:51,830
this picture so basically solved right

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:56,750
same as emails same as XMPP so problem

00:17:51,830 --> 00:18:03,530
solved and done with a presentation

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:06,350
victory problem solved ok well I'm not

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,510
so sure actually because I think we can

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,870
learn something from the from the past

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:15,680
from other services let's look for

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:19,970
example at diaspora versus facebook who

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,720
knows diaspora here yeah most people ok

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:27,260
so diaspora was basically a project who

00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,910
wanted to do competitor to Facebook with

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,550
the same functionality they even had a

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,110
few features more very good but the main

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,120
thing with the Aastra was that was

00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:37,610
federated so you can host like a

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,320
desperate serve on your machine and you

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,410
can use the social network with people

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,800
on different machines it's a very good

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,390
idea basically the same as as here all

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,290
right you type in something here and

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,470
there's other person gets a notification

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:55,220
and can like our status messages and

00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:01,690
look at our photos and all great fun ok

00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:07,840
victory again yeah so that's all good

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:10,370
but as we all know Diaspro hasn't won

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,830
facebook has one I'm sure that a square

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:15,530
has a few users but I'm sure this is

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,590
like less than 1% of facebook so what

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,590
went wrong someone has an idea here

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:32,899
people are too lazy to move yeah true so

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:43,909
what could we do that people move I was

00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:45,500
moving other ideas yeah well maybe for

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,169
those who haven't heard my comment in

00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,590
the back so I was saying that it's the

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:53,600
inertia people are simply well too lazy

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,429
or maybe not even technically

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,549
experienced enough to set up their own

00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,860
desk but I don't have to write I mean

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,110
that you can get a dice per hour service

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,669
provider somewhere same as Facebook sure

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,129
but everyone is on facebook there's

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:10,399
nobody on there's no catch 22 and not

00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:13,009
five years ago yeah I mean we've got it

00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:17,629
with with but things like we tend to do

00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:19,190
social or people using yeah messaging

00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,230
service isn't there lots of free

00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,179
alternatives take telegram a signal

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,370
right there really hard to gain a

00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,500
critical mass and people start moving

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,500
because there is no real pressure most

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,600
people are not aware of the concerns of

00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,049
the security of their being surveilled

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,639
it observed yeah yeah that's true not

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:40,519
love people care about privacy and all

00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:43,840
of people care about centralization yeah

00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,840
other ideas

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,030
I'm really strange I've never joined

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,490
facebook I've never played with diaspora

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,860
but as I understand it it's about the

00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,260
other people who are on the service hmm

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,170
and that's really the critical issue

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,770
you've got a tendency to want to speak

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:09,220
to our friends yeah exactly yeah it's

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:11,020
similar to the to the picture I showed

00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,240
earlier about the file singing and share

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,910
you can have your own server and it's

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,800
very secure but it's a bit lonely right

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,900
yeah busy you're alone on your server

00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,300
and share with others is not so much fun

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,280
and if you look at social networking

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,670
it's all about sharing know people are

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,400
there then yeah it's a bit lonely so

00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,280
next example X and P versus what's up

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,980
right when XMPP like I said open

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,550
standard lots of service lots of clients

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,080
open protocol great but and what's up is

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,050
only an example here obviously there are

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,760
many million others but obviously if you

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,800
look at schools and young people

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,570
nowadays that don't use XMPP they use

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:55,750
all this sudden messengers so probably

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:57,760
very very similar reasons as mentioned

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,700
before you have to move as mentioned

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,290
before you have to you have to find your

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,340
friends if your friends are not there

00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:10,330
then this is boring I tend to cover his

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,130
Twitter same example at Endicott open

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,100
source you can host it yourself it's all

00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,950
federated son great but everybody's

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,560
using theatre again same reasons in my

00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,810
opinion you have to brighter reason why

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,430
people should switch what you have to

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,470
product could use your experience fun

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:31,230
features or a modern and you have to

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:35,110
find your friends ekiga versus skype and

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,430
so on and i think if you look at what

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,650
we're building here with cloud

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,960
Federation versus dropbox and google or

00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:44,410
the danger is that we are making the

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,870
same mistake again that we think while

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,000
this is great like on cloud and next

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,190
cloud and tidy all right we Confederate

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,750
and just have to type in this ID and it

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,410
all works together and technically this

00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,980
is all good and fun but the danger is

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:03,220
that people actually use other services

00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,160
and we actually might lose your building

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,830
something that is technically great and

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,080
a lot of thought went to enter that but

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,419
the danger is that actually maybe the

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,280
big services they've in again and what

00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,290
we are doing we can be proud of our

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,870
selfie credit great open source and free

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,780
software but do we really fix the

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:27,040
internet we really made a difference

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:31,540
that's not completely clear okay so why

00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:34,510
why didn't this work I already asked you

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,640
a few few of you I think I completely

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,790
agree with their answers you can

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,110
summarize it with first finding people

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:46,980
also called the critical mass so that's

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:49,870
a that's a term and social networking

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,309
which basically means if if you are

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,470
known if you don't find your friends

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,820
then this is a problem if one of two or

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,230
one of two of your friends are not on

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,360
this platform that's okay that's not a

00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,620
big disaster but most of your people

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,230
should be there you should have the

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,630
critical mass and the second thing is

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,340
integration user experience we really

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,110
need innovative features it has to be

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:12,220
fun it has to be integrated with other

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,860
services otherwise otherwise people

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:17,350
won't use it and it's about these stupid

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,740
stuff like if you look at chat where you

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:24,130
can see that all this messenger has

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,710
crazy emojis and animations you might

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,559
think are all who cares my XMPP can do

00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:35,110
everything oh but if it's not really fun

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:39,669
then then this is a problem okay so what

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:42,160
can we do here how can we fix that they

00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,809
have a lot of things to do first let's

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,929
talk about finding context in the

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,940
critical mass that's a fundamental

00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,799
problem of this distributed and

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,679
federated services because it's in the

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,010
nature of itself has to be has to

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,380
protect your privacy no one should know

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,500
that I have a profile on my diaspora

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:04,770
server it has to be very private on the

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,320
other hand my friends should find me

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,450
that's that's a bit of a problem all

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,860
right and this is also i think at the

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,070
end i think this was the biggest problem

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,930
of times bro everybody was really it's

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,470
really about privacy but you can't find

00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:21,630
anyone and the solution for that is or

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,160
that a proposal at least is that we have

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:26,070
something like a look observer or

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,940
distributed hash table it is basically

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,940
like a public telephone book so you can

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,130
basically compares it with a phone if

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,460
you get a new phone and you telephone

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:41,090
number you can choose if you want to

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,820
have an entry in the public phone book

00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:46,170
basically and you can say no I care

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,230
about privacy I don't want to have this

00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,000
entry then people can't find you but you

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,250
can still give your telephone number to

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,850
your friends and I can call you but you

00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:59,130
have to do this like one one by one all

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,140
you can say all right you like that

00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,600
people call me and communicate with me I

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,880
want to have this phone book this phone

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,400
book entry and then I want to decide

00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,370
should I be found by only my name or

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,470
maybe my I don't know my the city where

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,720
I live in my address or maybe even more

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:19,260
making maybe a picture of mine and this

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,830
would be exactly the proposal here that

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,060
you can choose that if you want to be

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,380
found by others and with which data and

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,130
this can be done with a lookup server

00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,530
look up server could be done similar to

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,630
a TV cheeky server for example if you

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,340
know that something that you publish

00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,800
your information which is public anyway

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,520
like public key and this key in this M

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,980
example your name and your Federation ID

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,140
you can publish that and that doesn't

00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,140
protect your privacy at all doesn't have

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:56,910
to because that should be public that's

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:59,640
the purpose of it ok second thing is

00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:02,790
integration and user experience I think

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,670
we all should open ourselves a bit more

00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:08,250
with integrating other services so if

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:10,740
you're looking for someone to to chat

00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:14,640
with if you're looking for someone to do

00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:18,030
a free software version of a skype call

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,950
with maybe we should try to look into

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,530
other services like Facebook or Twitter

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,740
to find actually my friends and then and

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,309
then do the connection and of course

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,779
integration as

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,480
integration with other services like

00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:33,700
chat and voice video social interaction

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,919
this all belongs together so if you

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,320
think that the service like Dropbox will

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,509
be focused on only synchronizing files I

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,159
think this is wrong at the end you want

00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:43,480
to share a file with someone and then

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,759
you also want to communicate with this

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,940
person so integration I think it's also

00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:54,779
also super important ok so I think then

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,279
presentation so far this was all super

00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:01,330
theoretical and I only showed like one

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,369
or two pictures really boring so now I

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,919
want to show you a little bit more

00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:08,169
real-world examples which I think this

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,559
all makes it a little bit easier to to

00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,970
understand what I try to say here so

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:18,369
what I'm going to show you is part

00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:20,019
reality but part also the future so the

00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:22,149
first thing we need to solve the first

00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:24,100
thing that people should be able to do

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,110
is first and need to as mentioned before

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,899
you should be able to get your own

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,909
server I mean if everybody registered on

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:32,830
same service provider then there's

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:36,009
nothing to win so you want to have your

00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,529
own your own instance and there are

00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:40,690
different examples right you can

00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:43,299
basically use something like that that's

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,549
a Raspberry Pi in the case or something

00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:47,740
like that or you can go to a service

00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,720
provider like a big hosting center where

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,879
I don't want to have hardware at my home

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,499
I don't care i'm fine with going to a

00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:54,999
service provider but it should be it

00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,429
should be possible at more than one and

00:28:54,999 --> 00:29:00,759
I don't like one I want to be able to

00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,549
switch to a different one or I get this

00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:06,580
for my company or I have a linux server

00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:09,639
somewhere maybe opensuse just with a

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:12,399
simple zipper command install the

00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:14,409
software on it nicely packaged and

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,960
pre-configured and boom then I have my

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:20,679
own server so the first step that's

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,220
needed we have to make it super easy for

00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,169
everyone to get a server and it doesn't

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,840
mean like hosting an hour or not

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,940
everybody's linux admin could be that

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,840
doesn't answer but it's important of

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,490
different options okay then the next

00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,750
thing I want to use this service

00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,510
obviously

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:44,200
I created an example example is I'm

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:46,630
going on vacation and I'm basically

00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,510
taking lots of photos and I want to

00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,580
upload those photos to my cloud and here

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,130
I have two examples this is an iOS

00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,830
mobile app this is the only desktop

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,060
client so and we are and of course there

00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,580
are more options you can also do this

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,700
with web interface so we have to make it

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,630
super easy to automatically upload our

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:10,000
pictures in our data I mean mr. with the

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,070
iOS client there's and there's an full

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,570
automatic photo upload feature which

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,790
means every time you take a photo it's

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:19,330
automatically uploaded same as out

00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,190
iCloud or same as with Google photo this

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,080
would be easy desktop client is the same

00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,370
you just have to take your photos put it

00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,410
into one director it's automatically

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,380
uploaded web interface works the same

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:30,550
okay so I'm just walking around

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,800
somewhere the sea taking nice photos

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,860
with my phone and I don't have to do

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,850
anything they automatically uploaded to

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,400
one of my service here it doesn't matter

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:44,590
so it's super easy okay now my photos

00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,780
are uploaded that's great and I can go

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,060
to my to my web in the face and then I

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,430
see something like that as you can see

00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,130
here the awesome opensuse cloud here

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,800
again and he have a photo gallery of all

00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:59,830
my photos at great i can look at them

00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,500
and that's fun okay but again it's a bit

00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:07,300
lonely i'm only alone here I want to

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:10,290
show this to other people so what can I

00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,210
do i click on a on this icon here and

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:17,080
then i can share this with other people

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,120
in the current version of the software

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,040
and this is the case for own cloud and

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,710
next cloud and tidy on everybody else

00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,720
you click here and then you can type in

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,180
an ID and a name and then this person

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,890
gets a notification as i said before

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,410
that's a bit boring and also about

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:36,970
critical mass who can how can i find

00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,950
people on other servers and then we need

00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:42,250
something like that click on that and

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,900
then you can see a list of people well

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,170
these are the people that I interacted

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:50,290
with last time I just click on them

00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,940
and then the shares done easy but

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,010
obviously you know that this planet has

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,860
a little bit more a few more people here

00:31:54,010 --> 00:32:00,580
than just three so what we need here is

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,500
also contact a search field here and the

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,360
idea is if i type in a name here it

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,030
obviously searches the own server and

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,670
also searches full service that i'm

00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:12,610
connected with but also it should search

00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:15,850
the global phone book this lookup server

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,740
that i mentioned before so then i have

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,480
basically see the results here and as

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,550
you nice pictures oh yeah this is like

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,850
here this is like richard from from

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:27,820
opensuse yeah I recognized the picture

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:29,230
and the description here click Share so

00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,590
this is how it this is how it should

00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,600
work obviously sharing is not all so

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,850
maybe there's another menu where I can

00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,220
say additionally i also want to call

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,950
this person or send an email or start a

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,450
chat session share something look up the

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:48,580
details yeah and of course this is all

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,590
federated at calling with web RTC for

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,680
example email obviously federated chat

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:56,380
XMPP ends on so I think this is how it

00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,680
should work and you might wonder ok how

00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:03,700
can I find Richard sorry for using the

00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,770
example so this is a screenshot this

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,380
doesn't exist yet this is basically

00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,660
prototype software here but this is

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,880
something this is a personal page from

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,740
from own cloud or next load where you

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,390
can upload your profile photo and type

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,390
in your name and email address and

00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,300
everything the new feature here is that

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:25,870
here you have two small icons you can

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,580
see this is public this is private if

00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,240
you click on them you get a drop-down

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:34,270
like that where you can say ok my email

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,620
address should be only private I don't

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,680
want to share my email address with

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,440
anyone or you can say my email address

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,390
should be shared with my contacts or my

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,180
email address should be shared in public

00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:49,210
and with a shared with public and people

00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:51,520
can actually find me that can type in

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,710
any sharing dialogue of any server on

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,780
this planet my email address and then

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,110
boom you can see how yeah that's Frankie

00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:02,170
as a picture you can already call him

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:04,240
chat with him and also share with him so

00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:07,139
that's basically the idea every time I

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,639
select public here the entry that I

00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:11,440
marked as public is pushed to the

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,669
central lookup server and then people

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,639
can find me that's the idea that's all

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:20,470
we already work going on for this for

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,720
this lookup server the ideas that do not

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,359
have one obviously it should be done as

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,399
gpg keys with us a bit where you have

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,379
different ones with multi-master

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:33,970
replication so it's it's basically

00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:38,320
doesn't go down as mentioned before

00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:40,060
because Federation is always done in the

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,970
future the idea is to do with

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,700
distributed hash tables I'm working with

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,050
the w3c organization to work on a

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,510
standard for that so that more people

00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,280
implement that and of course you also

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,590
want to integrate proprietary services

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,280
so if you don't find if I don't find my

00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,780
my uncle here then maybe I can say work

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,640
out and maybe then look at facebook

00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:05,500
maybe my uncle is on facebook mayor can

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,210
find my uncle there okay so the next

00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:13,450
thing we want to do is its integration

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:16,090
so this is another screenshot of the

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,160
awesome opensuse cloud where you can see

00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,350
my vacation pictures here if I click on

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,380
a picture you can see that you can do

00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:27,850
comments here okay so you can basically

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:30,580
say okay comment this picture and you

00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:32,800
can also post a comment and basically do

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,080
social networking you can also do a

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,840
favorite here something like like and

00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,090
maybe in the future can also tech people

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,700
very similar to through social networks

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:46,150
but this is all again on my server but

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:49,540
federated between different servers okay

00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:52,090
but again that should be more maybe I

00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,490
can click on young here and maybe then I

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,280
get a menu which is like to a call or

00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:00,130
send the email or start a church okay

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,109
because basically commenting here might

00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,359
be fun but maybe I want to directly call

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:06,609
this person arcade this photo where is

00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,769
it how did you do it

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:12,369
can we go there together to take another

00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:14,380
photo or something okay then maybe click

00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:17,289
on chat and done something like that

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,329
opens that's a chat window and then you

00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:22,660
can directly Chet here and talk about

00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:25,450
this photo and obviously this should be

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,210
all open protocols and free software as

00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:31,569
before so for this chat app which exists

00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:33,099
by the way already this is all XMPP as

00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,289
you don't have to do this on this page

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:39,849
here because there are other ways to

00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:43,569
also to chat and this is another example

00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:46,119
maybe if i click on call maybe then that

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,160
are dizzy window opens where directly

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,279
can talk with someone and talk about

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,009
this photo but this is not only about

00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:57,339
the web like this is a screenshot of an

00:36:54,009 --> 00:36:59,170
android XMPP checkland so obviously you

00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:01,839
can do exactly the same chat that

00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,089
happens here about my photo also here on

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,220
your phone or if you want to call

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:09,489
someone you can do it in the browser web

00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,499
RTC but there should also be a a mobile

00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:16,720
app I can directly call people on the

00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:19,230
phone so this is basically the overview

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,989
how I think this all should work

00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,390
basically we have open source file sync

00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:27,430
and share solutions like own cloud for

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,890
example i can host myself with

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,989
Federation which already exists that's

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,349
great but I think we have to bring this

00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:37,089
to the next level in two areas first of

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:40,089
all we have to solve the critical mass

00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:43,380
problem we have to find people only if

00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:46,779
you find people then people will use it

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,450
so basically have to give up the privacy

00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:51,430
a little bit like similar to a to a

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,650
public phone book I can say ok I want to

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,359
be found then it's fun and the other

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:59,440
thing is I think we have to integrate

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:04,839
with other services like here with video

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,819
and voice and chat and so on I when you

00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:09,839
have one slide left and your summary and

00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:14,109
then I was hoping for discussion anyways

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,569
so the summary is I think to fix the

00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:19,540
internet from this centralized cloud

00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:20,800
services we can do something here

00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,800
but I think we have to do it in the

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,500
right way we have to implement this free

00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,020
software servers and clients it has to

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,760
be super easy to host maybe it's a

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,560
docker image now it's a package for

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,350
opensuse and maybe as it with a device

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,840
that you can buy so the easy to hold to

00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:40,540
host powerful features and good user

00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,310
experience sometimes developers like us

00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:46,000
we sometimes forget the user experience

00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:47,680
but it's actually important we have to

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,230
solve the critical mass problem we have

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,330
to find other people we have to

00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,890
integrate with other services all the

00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:57,310
communication between the different

00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,610
nodes has to be open standards and this

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:03,130
all has to be federated and distributed

00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:06,550
so and this is now the the end of my

00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:11,830
presentation and now I'm hoping to have

00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:14,500
a discussion ok thanks for the vision um

00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,060
but might be her etiquette question but

00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,100
aren't you just creating another central

00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,130
service with their phone directory who

00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,380
owns it and how can you protect it from

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,940
being misused and this is spammers

00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,860
heaven what you're creating in this

00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,050
current form yeah and how do you

00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,820
validate that the person you're finding

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,800
in the address book is really the person

00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,830
you're looking for not somebody who set

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,870
up a fake account yeah yeah excellent

00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:41,050
question this is not not so easy i think

00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:43,720
that to question this is how you prevent

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:46,030
another central and entity and a second

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,500
this validation of people i think

00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,430
answering the second question first

00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,980
validation is something with the web of

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:56,560
trust probably or you can see ok this

00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,080
person is like confront the other people

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,240
as a higher karma or something and this

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,100
is not implemented yet but something

00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,190
like a web of trust which is also bit

00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:08,410
similar to how gpg works i think this

00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,140
could be a could be an idea but a first

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:17,220
question about central and entity yeah i

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,450
mean that's a that's a tough one what

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,520
we're building here at the moment is

00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,620
something that is not running on one

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,620
machine but on different which it had

00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,450
replicated around so it's a multi-master

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,520
replication that the idea is that not

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,410
one entity hosts of

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,080
and that you can host one server but

00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,240
then you have I don't know me 10 trusted

00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,370
organizations may be over zoos is one of

00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,500
it maybe rachel is one of it maybe I

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,850
don't know someone else is one of it and

00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,910
we're basically replicating the data

00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:49,240
around of course I agree today the

00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:51,400
database itself is still very it's a

00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,330
centralized database here that's true

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,730
but yeah I mean it's difficult to solve

00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,590
it's possible that there are different

00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,910
databases and then maybe a server

00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,800
various different ones same as gbg clans

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,250
we were different servers instead of

00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:15,460
just one but yeah that's a that's a

00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:17,200
problem so well I think one of the

00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,140
interesting questions is bad because

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,450
we'll learn in different ways that's

00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:26,170
famous too funny things that you don't

00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:29,860
want to have and the other point is the

00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:32,230
treaty gamers I think the best way even

00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,530
if you don't like it is some indication

00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:38,290
where Facebook Google topics whatever

00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:42,130
because moving to people here in the

00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:46,960
room is easy but moving our friends have

00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:48,670
fun yeah i agree i mean that's what i

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,640
said earlier we have to integrate with

00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:54,100
other services where the users are we

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,630
have to win them over of course I'm the

00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,280
real vision at the end is that we don't

00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,130
need as other services anymore at some

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,810
point so I think we should have an

00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,210
infrastructure that can we live without

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,940
it but at least for the beginning it's I

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:14,320
think it's important to build purchase

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:19,150
yeah things can you build any groups or

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,360
anything it's that you can say i don't

00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:25,090
want to have the other people on my own

00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,030
cloud or anything like that but we have

00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:33,010
got this security but we don't get any

00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:34,630
spam or anything else yeah so um these

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,390
people that i'm talking about that not

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:40,480
necessarily uses of my own server

00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:44,290
I mean I myself can decide which what

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,720
accounts are great on my own entity so

00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:49,200
no one is using any resources or storage

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,060
or anything on myself if I don't want to

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,410
but this is more about interaction with

00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,610
people on different machines like have a

00:42:53,410 --> 00:43:02,170
shared directory we are crude sharing

00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:04,240
adders is your your power user I can see

00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,790
it because that's missing group sharing

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,620
is impossible with local users at the

00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:11,650
moment group sharing start yet possible

00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:17,380
federated users yes that's work to be

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:19,120
done so two thoughts spring to mind 1

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,040
i'm just going to chuck out there which

00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:25,870
is probably really hated by everybody in

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:29,050
this room and that is i find it hard not

00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:32,560
to join facebook because there are bands

00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:35,530
that will give me free music so they can

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,320
get my surveillance details there are

00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,870
companies that I can't even browse their

00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:44,520
product list because they insist on

00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:47,530
having my identity surveillance details

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:51,100
how are you ever going to get critical

00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:54,010
mass of users if people aren't going to

00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,680
be able to buy your contact details and

00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:59,890
by the details to follow your behavior

00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,010
online that's one of the reasons why all

00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,990
these companies like McDonald's

00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:07,210
advertising facebook over and over again

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,360
and I don't think you have the marketing

00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:14,020
budget to combat all of the companies

00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:16,240
who pay to advertise Facebook in

00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:20,280
response to the tracking details so

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,350
that's point one like it point two is

00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:28,660
identity provision both for individuals

00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:31,120
and services is a complicated thing you

00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,140
can either go down the PGP area or you

00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,980
can go down the x5

00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,720
nine type models pgp is very good for

00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,330
slow building communities where people

00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,210
have met each other many times but it's

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,740
not very good for things like group

00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,800
authentication and more importantly deal

00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,920
with indication yeah and how do you work

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,860
in a web of trust system when you want

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,550
to say hey this element of the web of

00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:00,280
trust I no longer trust it's okay for

00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:04,860
deals indicating individuals but not for

00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,760
the authenticating groups and so I have

00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,740
interesting areas of who's actually

00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,800
going to discuss terms of services

00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,630
betweens identity providers or services

00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,640
how are you going to manage all of that

00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:18,310
there's actually a lot of complications

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,350
in Federation that we've seen before in

00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:22,150
other communities have done Federation

00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:26,050
and yeah you haven't touched on any of

00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:30,970
those yeah yeah lots of questions let's

00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:33,250
start at the beginning so yeah as we all

00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,720
know Facebook Google Twitter and so on

00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,350
they have interesting business models as

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,690
you mentioned maybe they're directly

00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,990
selling your data or they are making it

00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:45,940
available to advertisers but whatever

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:52,450
out there basically the business model

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:54,670
is is your data so I'm not sure we

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,320
really need something like that here if

00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,330
you look at the examples that I

00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,800
mentioned before like I do an own cloud

00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,140
and neckla on the others we actually

00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,330
have different business models I don't

00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,630
want to go into details here but none of

00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:10,360
those entities is getting earning money

00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:12,270
by selling any data and I think it's

00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,550
possible have a business model like that

00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:19,270
then to your second point is

00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:22,360
advertisement I'm yes sort of disagree I

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:25,600
myself haven't seen any single Facebook

00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,490
TV spot or radio spot or something I

00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,800
think Facebook and Twitter that

00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,950
basically we're growing out on their own

00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,400
I think we can grow this too without the

00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:38,740
advertising budget maybe I'm not even we

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,940
will need at some point TV spots but I

00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,610
am Not sure

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:46,600
it is a good service maybe we can do

00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:48,310
without it so I hope I totally agree

00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,700
that we need to have a business model

00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,990
need to pay the developers but I really

00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,140
really think this can be done without

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:58,960
selling any user data so there's not

00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:03,640
this not mandatory to a second point

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,250
about Federation and I BP I'm well aware

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,680
of the fact that a lot of way more

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:11,530
clever people than I am thought for a

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,280
long long time about that and the tough

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:17,310
problems and I'm not standing here

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,050
because I'm saying that I can solve that

00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:25,150
but we probably want to learn something

00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:28,590
from existing solutions and I mean you

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:31,780
mentioned tpg there's a lot of work and

00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:33,310
brain power went into that and I hope

00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,900
that we can learn from that I'm not

00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,360
standing here I'm saying that I can

00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,790
reinvent it and make it better it's just

00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:45,630
basically bringing these concepts into

00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:47,830
this ideas that is answer the question

00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:50,230
but I have a follow-up question on the

00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,460
first part so if you're integrating with

00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:54,310
all these cloud services like Facebook

00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,610
and etc which exist with a business

00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,140
model to just sell your data how are you

00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,210
going to avoid them abusing that

00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:05,730
integration to end up selling the data

00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:09,180
of your federated users yeah

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,490
yeah yeah that's true if you

00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,320
authenticate against facebook you

00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:15,510
already give away some of your data

00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,390
that's and there's no way around it I

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:21,060
don't know what they're doing so this is

00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,380
basically this is a risk I mean

00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,869
obviously you wouldn't upload your own

00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,119
your own address book I think you don't

00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:30,210
have to this is a special decried as far

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,980
as I know that you can block but at that

00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:34,950
point at least Facebook knows who you

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,710
are that's true that's that's a

00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:39,570
compromise why I think also at the end

00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,970
we need to have our own infrastructure

00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:51,300
we shouldn't rely on those others to

00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:53,790
find our front it's only temporary so

00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,850
I'm playing the devil's advocate for

00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:59,119
facebook now my facebook is not selling

00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:02,850
your data what they sell is

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:07,350
advertisement by Dennis ASL is targeting

00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:10,830
clusters of users or groups of users the

00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:12,810
only situation where you actually give

00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:15,300
away something like your email address

00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:17,250
is when you allow a facebook app to

00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:21,660
access your data so and that's basically

00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:25,730
opt-in on the other hand that means if

00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:29,910
you were to build this one big directory

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:34,040
it could also be something with AB its

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:37,470
business model driven by advertising so

00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,900
I'm sorry for saying this it would be

00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,090
one possible business model like in 10

00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,310
years from now I will probably regret it

00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,820
if somebody really

00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:52,590
meant that yeah but it could be in

00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:57,030
theory doing advertisement in the same

00:49:52,590 --> 00:50:00,840
way that respect privacy it so yeah okay

00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:03,960
enough playing devil's advocate not exam

00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:07,350
very very important questions and if you

00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,120
look at a public telephone book I think

00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:11,250
at least commercial ones actually has

00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,370
advertisement in the public telephone

00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:15,870
book not sure this can be completed

00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:19,580
translated to something like that but I

00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,580
completely agree yes of course I mean

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,150
the only solution i have for that at the

00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,160
moment that the server is open source

00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:28,860
everybody can host it themselves and we

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,570
become part of this master replication

00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,150
network and then offer service without

00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:35,430
advertisement and then hopefully shuts

00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:37,800
down this other energy which is has a

00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,930
website full of advertisement but that's

00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:42,000
yeah something to consider a completely

00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:43,890
agree and i also agree with your

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,780
statement about facebook i think this is

00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,730
a misconception a lot of people think

00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,410
that facebook might sell your names or

00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:53,040
something a lot of people use facebook

00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:55,740
under a fake name facebook doesn't sell

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,200
your name in fact facebook doesn't care

00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,030
at all about your name the only thing

00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,940
facebook cares about that there is one

00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,470
person where's this interests and always

00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,870
drives in the morning from this location

00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:09,450
to that location and is friended with

00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,980
his other with his other entity so he's

00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:13,170
in the perfect target group for this

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,600
specific advertisement and then

00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,180
necessarily this advertisement they

00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:25,170
don't care how you what your name is so

00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:27,930
yeah that's true so maybe also kind of

00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:30,420
the devil's advocate here well and the

00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:31,980
success of services like Facebook or

00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,260
Twitter basically has shown that a

00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,270
centralized service has merits because

00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,690
well people find each other they are all

00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:42,350
bear and well I guess you have to

00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:44,670
separate between the technical term but

00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,110
Twitter's also distributed all across

00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,900
the globe it's not just a single machine

00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:51,510
somewhere

00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:53,980
but i think the real concern is that

00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,049
there's always a commercial entity

00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,260
behind it that owns all this data and

00:51:56,049 --> 00:52:01,180
that's the concern and maybe an

00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,099
alternative food need to come up with a

00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:06,430
service that is centralized from a

00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:08,440
technical point of view but also has

00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,869
technical measures that allows to

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,510
prevent privacy breaches from happening

00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:15,549
because well let's say the data on the

00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,650
central service is always encrypted so

00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,930
the one hosting service can't even make

00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:22,270
use of the database or down there but it

00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,039
has a benefit for the users because they

00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,130
are all interconnected to each other

00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:28,839
inconvenient yeah yeah now I mean at I

00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,640
totally agree and then there are ideas I

00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:32,170
think it had on my slide that in the

00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,150
future like a full distributed hash

00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:37,150
table could be something which is done

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:39,460
fully or distributed another thing is in

00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:41,140
my ms green shirt i showed earlier i

00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,390
think i forgot to mention that when i

00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,730
show the email address of a person this

00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:49,170
could be hashed for example I this could

00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:52,000
be stored in a hashed way which mean I

00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:53,559
can't like autocomplete all email

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,390
addresses on this planet this would be a

00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,190
bit strange right but it would work that

00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:59,529
if i type in your email address and

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:05,430
after type in the last letter it says

00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:09,910
found with a hash so did but yeah

00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:14,200
something to go god somebody was

00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,660
mentioning that facebook is interested

00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:20,230
in your name they're only interested in

00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:22,450
your location what you need in your new

00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,270
advertising profile I think it's not

00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,920
only advertising because you also

00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:31,390
mentioned they're using location-based

00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:34,960
services means that if you have a mobile

00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:38,349
device they're tracking where you are in

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,660
the advertising model since we began

00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:43,059
with location-based services in the

00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:45,220
telecommunications industry is that

00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:46,900
would it be great apps

00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,359
as walking through a shopping arcade and

00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,240
then the advertisement for that shot

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:56,470
before their nose will pop up on their

00:53:52,240 --> 00:54:01,050
mobile phone fine but you don't need a

00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:03,670
real name if we transfer data to

00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,680
somebody else we need to be very certain

00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,320
that is that somebody that we think of

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,970
this yeah yeah I could be degree

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,280
actually I want to encourage everyone

00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:15,369
here to look at the facebook advertising

00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,650
page this is super important if you just

00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:19,450
go to Facebook and say I want to book

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,760
advertisement want to book a banner

00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:26,380
there that's super important you can do

00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:29,710
something like i want to buy like 10,000

00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:32,230
or thousand been of use from people who

00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:34,119
drive by this pizzeria because i'm a

00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:36,790
pizzeria drive by this pizzeria are

00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,170
every evening between five and six

00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:39,670
because at five to see that i don't have

00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:41,980
customers i want to have customers on a

00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,750
buying pizza between five and six so i

00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,849
want to show this banner to every all

00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,890
the people with oil every evening drive

00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:50,290
by my pizzeria at the time so you can

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:53,470
buy stuff like that on their website

00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:57,670
this is this is why this works so much

00:54:53,470 --> 00:55:00,660
better than TV advertisement yeah okay

00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,880
so one more question after burn hurts

00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:07,270
okay so i wanted to mention is that

00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:09,220
there are centralized services run by

00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,109
non commercial entities like the colonel

00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,930
org and TV and project and OpenStack

00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:16,630
foundation and these things and they

00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:18,730
generally work very well I don't think

00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,980
they are concerned about these so it

00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:23,650
need not all be decentralized but

00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:27,220
commercial rests need to be taken care

00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:29,430
of now I have obviously hurt I mean this

00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,570
was a bit provocative here are basically

00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,369
decentralize always good central is

00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,920
obvious bed obviously in durand as a

00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:39,190
gray area in the middle but overall I

00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,170
think it is a good thing to have to not

00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:44,140
have vital services of the internet in

00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:49,589
the hands of single entities so that's

00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:49,589
mainly the pond okay any more questions

00:55:49,740 --> 00:56:00,010
that's what I you the first one on stage

00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:03,599
that I here saying that we should leave

00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:06,190
the idea of the open source community

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,289
telling the rest of the world to screw

00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:11,579
up with their commercial ideas but

00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:14,440
rather step out contact them and use

00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:17,400
them as a basis to get information we

00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:21,339
need to get our own stuff running I'm

00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,410
not sure I understood correctly you're

00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:25,359
for me you're the first 1i here on state

00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,099
saying that we should step out and

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:30,640
contact proprietary services like

00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:34,869
Facebook Twitter a letter to get data we

00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,700
need to get our own stuff rolling yeah I

00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:38,500
think we need to build britches all

00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:41,319
right i mean for example we're all using

00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,880
ilc more or less i think most of us

00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:44,920
somehow all right and i think we are all

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,740
happy with the service and has lots of

00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,049
benefits but we can be also have to

00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,849
realize that most of the young people

00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:53,559
they use I don't know what's about

00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:56,920
facebook Messenger whatever and of

00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:58,390
course we can be proud of our choice and

00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,279
say where is the better technology and

00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:01,960
multi q and everything but if you really

00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:03,730
want to change the world if you really

00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,740
want to make it better this was one of

00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,599
my first slide here I mean if it's only

00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,089
bought myself what what what works for

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,190
me sure I mean I have all everything I

00:57:10,089 --> 00:57:13,960
need but if you really want to change

00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,880
the world and make it better that we

00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,880
have to build purchase there if somehow

00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:22,750
I'm not proposing to do a pact with the

00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,730
devil right but I mean we have to build
