Title: h01ger: Reproducible builds everywhere and beyond
Publication date: 2016-06-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2016
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/996-reproducible-builds-everywhere-and-beyond

The presentation will describe how the Debian reproducible builds team made 85% of the Debian archive reproducible, what steps are left to reach 100% and what steps are needed beyond reproducible builds, so that every user can easily and meaningful benefit from them.

While the presentation will be largely about the Debian work on the area, it will also portray many other projects collaborative work on reproducible builds, as our goal is to make reproducible builds the norm for free software: "It's not free software if it's not reproducible."
