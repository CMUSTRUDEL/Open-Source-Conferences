After the SUSE Manager team had chosen Salt as the future engine behind SUSE Manager, Joachim "Joe" Werner, the product manager for SUSE Manager, spent some time to learn the project hands-on.

This is a very personal report about that experience, from extending Salt with code to manage WIFI-controlled LED lamps for a demo at the SUSECon conference to first experiments with writing a Salt module for Snapper.

This talk is for you if you don't just want to know about using Salt for configuration management, but are more interested in contributing to it or hacking it for your own needs. Basic Python skills recommended to make sense of the example code. ;-)
