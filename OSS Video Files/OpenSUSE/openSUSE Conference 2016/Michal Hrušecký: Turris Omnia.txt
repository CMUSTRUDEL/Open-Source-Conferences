CZ.NIC is working hard on releasing their new router called Turris Omnia. It is open source and open hardware, high-performance ARM box that can become the central server of your home as it can actually do much more than just routing. Why is it interesting? What can it do? Can it run openSUSE? All of that and more will be the topic of this talk.
