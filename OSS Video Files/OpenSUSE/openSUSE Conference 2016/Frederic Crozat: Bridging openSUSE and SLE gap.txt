Starting with (upcoming) Leap 42.2 and SLE 12 SP2, a lot of cooperation has been done to bridge gaps between the two distributions.

We'll talk of one specific example, GNOME desktop, where openSUSE and SLE teams worked together on improving our common work and how it helped both teams.

This is still a work in progress at the time of this writing, we'll be sharing what we achieved, how we did it, what failed (if it did) and how we can improve.
