Title: Frederic Crozat: Bridging openSUSE and SLE gap
Publication date: 2016-06-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2016
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/904-bridging-opensuse-and-sle-gap

Starting with (upcoming) Leap 42.2 and SLE 12 SP2, a lot of cooperation has been done to bridge gaps between the two distributions.

We'll talk of one specific example, GNOME desktop, where openSUSE and SLE teams worked together on improving our common work and how it helped both teams.

This is still a work in progress at the time of this writing, we'll be sharing what we achieved, how we did it, what failed (if it did) and how we can improve.

okay so let's start thank you everybody

00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:21,189
for attending this talk my name

00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,759
rakossa i work at susie for almost six

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:28,360
years now and for those who don't know

00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:32,410
me a long time ago i took care of

00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:36,040
pushing systemd in opensuse but these

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,860
days i try to break less things so I'm

00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,680
taking care of suse linux enterprise

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,739
desktop and i'm the release manager

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,860
there and i bring the other Slee release

00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:53,559
manager so today i will talk about

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:59,320
bridging the gap between opensuse n and

00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:01,180
see if you look at our schedules it was

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,509
bridging the gap between three and leap

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:07,720
and I just renamed the talk because it's

00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:12,070
not really Ludwick we'll talk about it

00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:18,130
later but yeah and the example will be

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:21,729
around noon so what a problem we are

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:25,509
currently facing between slid on one

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:28,810
side and opens is on the other side so

00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:33,040
this talk will be mostly about me

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,799
speaking with a slick at still being an

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,070
open source contributor but with the

00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,659
sleep perspective and how we can improve

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:49,799
our community participation in opensuse

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:54,970
so in the past for those of you knows

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,990
falsely 12 week or sometime it s b0 so

00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:02,290
for the first rays of least 12 we used

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:07,149
opensuse factory as a basis as a cause

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:10,239
base after 13 dot 1 was released which

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:13,160
included blooms read attendant something

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:18,230
oh 3 dot n dot 3

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:22,100
and based on this the desktop

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:25,250
engineering engineers a to z worked on

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,490
fixing bugs bugs from customer bugs

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,720
found by our rock you a work phone by a

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,620
lot of people they also worked on back

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,080
rotting feature which we are in the 11

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,140
cut paste because we have to maintain

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,640
the feature set from previous enterprise

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,370
product in the new releases and we had

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,670
to make sure that for our enterprise

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,740
users the usual experience was silly now

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,760
we can change the user experience but it

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:06,320
still has to be acceptable for

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,280
enterprise users which means that for

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,980
those of you who have used minimum 3

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,170
there is a radical changes there are

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:21,260
radical changes in the user experience

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:24,080
by the cliq gnome shell which some time

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,910
is not really appreciated by everybody

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:32,270
because it's really a radical so gnome

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,760
signum people upstream try to change

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,720
this and allowed us a different way of

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,390
doing things which is called on classic

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,810
but non classic was not suitable for us

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:48,620
for for suse linux enterprise desktop

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,020
because it was still a two-panel thing

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,690
pinging you have a pan around the top

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,900
and open a browser bottom a bit like mac

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,270
OS if you if you like so we worked on

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:04,400
something which would be similar to slab

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:08,209
for people who remember c11 and old open

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,360
to the release them to had a final

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:15,680
result bottom with a big menu which has

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,560
quarks lab and we worked on trying to

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,229
get a user experience a bit similar to

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,850
that which is called sleek classic so

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:25,760
this this is for instance a feature

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,530
which is at the moment only available in

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,190
well it's not a variable on pursuit

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:35,350
we'll come to that later so we had

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,890
people region ears which worked a lot on

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:43,030
stabilizing and developing first stuff

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:48,800
fog gnome but firstly not for a purpose

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:52,700
and which means that it was a huge work

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,500
for the engineers the developers the

00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:02,150
curate to make this usable by for

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,120
enterprise customer and which means at

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:11,320
some time when you have a lot of work to

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:17,720
do you have a tight schedule sorry sorry

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:20,390
because for enterprise distribution we

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,080
have deadlines and we really work out to

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,200
meet those deadlines it's very much more

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,300
difficult to push deadlines compared to

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,820
a community distribution so sometimes or

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,400
Susan engineers didn't always had the

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,210
time to submit changes 4tube gnome

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,080
factory which is not really good but

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,450
that's life and also we had also another

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,490
problem it's at low factory was no

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,180
longer on the same version of gnomes

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,700
that we were working in sleep because we

00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,830
gnome releases a new version every six

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,810
months we were stuck in a dinner on the

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,420
release tree top 10 dot something but

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:08,230
factory was already got three dot 11 dot

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,380
something which means that for our

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:16,310
engineers if they wanted to put their

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,910
fixes there are new feature too opensuse

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,480
it means the doing the work twice one

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:27,670
time for soup hoarsely 12 and another

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:30,980
time sometimes reread rewrite everything

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:33,350
for for opensuse and again tight

00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,300
schedule means we didn't have time to do

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,810
that we said what we will do that later

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,199
also we didn't had a bunch way when we

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,310
worked on ski 12 SP 0 it was still in

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,680
the infancy it was starting to be used

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,560
for tumbleweed so I was not even temper

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,050
with other time I mean the one we know

00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:01,110
today as double with it was great KH

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:05,940
tamper with so we focused on making a

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,009
slit where r SP 0 rock solid and yeah we

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,090
will take care of web streaming a work

00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:14,460
later yeah yeah okay so that was the

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:20,250
past so what's the problem the problem

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:22,590
is that life continues even when you

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,090
have when you release a product sleep

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,129
well as p0 we still had to do or people

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,659
out to do say day to day job meaning

00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:38,669
fixing bugs coming from support firstly

00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:43,110
11 force the 11 service pack 3 or sleet

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:45,240
12 sp sp 0 they had to work on the new

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:50,430
service back for stealin they have to

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,949
take care of also security fixes when

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:58,229
the security team asker's asks engineer

00:07:52,949 --> 00:08:01,199
to help etc etc etc so we said okay

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,870
we'll do that falsely 12 sp1 because

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:09,020
it's a stabilization release we should

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:13,830
have enough time to upstream all work no

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:19,289
no because we really want it again to do

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:22,529
a rock-solid distro and working just to

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,080
stabilize the code because after you

00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,810
read is a product even if you have a lot

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,419
of beta testing a lot of works are

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,110
discovered one sec the destroyer is out

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,349
we know that it's true falsely it's true

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,449
for opensuse people test go not during

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,060
beta test the test after it's released

00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:44,970
and then they start to complain we know

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,430
that so we after that we do a new

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:52,830
service back after year

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:56,670
fix bugs and again yeah people were too

00:08:52,830 --> 00:09:00,089
busy to upstream the network on opensuse

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:04,140
and we are we where at this point where

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:07,620
we had three detained at something with

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:11,070
a lot of bug fixes some feature in the

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:15,690
c12 code code stream on one side and we

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:18,899
had leap or opensuse factory w it on the

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:23,690
other side which was much more which

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:28,470
while running much more recent code and

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:33,120
we weren't really happy because yeah

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:37,529
it's it's not something good to do even

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,170
in the open source open source world

00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,360
it's something which everybody knows

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,180
it's not something you should do you can

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,640
do it for a while but you shouldn't do

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,320
that in the long term because it's not

00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:58,050
sustainable so we wonder what can we do

00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:02,060
with service pack 2 so from the

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:10,070
beginning for service back to we decided

00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:14,790
to sync again with opensuse n in a agile

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:17,310
jargon reimburse our technical depth so

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,370
for people doing scrums or any kind of

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:28,050
agile method they will know what what it

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:31,560
means it's those funky buzzword so we

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:35,820
can also think changed on the open to

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,450
the side of the world after 3 12's busy

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,440
while is released and after sp1 whether

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:49,430
it is opensuse decided to create a new

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:55,680
distro openSUSE leap based on sisley

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:57,530
codes code base so maybe we buy we again

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,410
i have nicely hat

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:04,830
sooo de Souza desktop team we have two

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,620
teams maybe the desktop team that Susie

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,520
could work with the opensuse with home

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:15,180
team and maybe we could work in in good

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:18,960
intelligence and collaborate to make

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,950
sure that the work we do on at Susie can

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,740
benefit everybody not just the sleek

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:30,600
customer this is a customer but also the

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:35,130
community at large so that was one thing

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:39,290
we had in mind and the other was for

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:43,920
service back to go we weave all product

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:46,260
management people we decided to create

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,650
the desktop stack which is something

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,290
that in the past was not really done

00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:57,590
during service back at Susan it was on

00:11:52,290 --> 00:12:02,340
one or two chime dings 11 but usually

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:05,580
sorry sorry for your ears usually it's

00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,850
at something in the past we were less

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:12,750
doing are changing things during service

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:16,020
back but yes so now we change Colonel

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:19,950
even upgrade kernels to major releases

00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:22,710
as respect so it's like as my boss said

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,840
it's like changing the engine in a in a

00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:28,080
flight where you are flying you know

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:32,160
okay we can do that so why not upgrade

00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,730
the desktop so the plan was to upgrade

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:40,740
the desktop stack we weren't sure we

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,800
don't three dot 18 or three 220 yeah we

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,430
were unsure also we talked with the

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,460
opensuse bloom team and told them what

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:54,650
while our plan we wanted to create a

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,650
desktop we want it to

00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,809
and we wanted to know what they were

00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:02,869
planning to do for their next leap

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:05,869
release next leap release meaning the

00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:11,119
one which is going to happen in october

00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:13,670
november this year 42 the two maybe we

00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:17,149
could work together maybe we could make

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:20,540
sure that we use the same source code

00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:26,959
for the next service back and the next

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:31,999
leap that would be nice so we had to

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:36,860
choose which version of Rome to pick for

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:39,949
service back to and probably we had

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,149
touched to option 3 dot 18 at the time

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:47,089
so it was end of last year you give you

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,999
a rose idea three dot 18 was already

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:53,389
released it was already in tumbleweed

00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:58,129
which means open QA was running on it

00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:04,339
people were already using it yeah it's

00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:08,240
released we could reduce that it would

00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:12,850
be easy because it's already there but

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:18,529
it would mean that if we do bug fixes

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:21,110
because we do when we test stuff we need

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,379
to carry those bug fixes for a while

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,959
until they are major upstream on the

00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,389
other hand if you start working on a

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,629
code base which is not released upstream

00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:38,119
yet if you send your patches and they

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:40,309
are merged when the stable product is

00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:41,959
released by upstream you don't even have

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:46,699
to maintain your patch they already

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:50,569
upstream so we had 3 10 3 at a time it

00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:53,569
was not yet released we were yeah

00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:58,010
something like November or December last

00:14:53,569 --> 00:15:00,380
year but

00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,080
sweetened tea was not released it was

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,860
still in development but it would be

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:10,400
probably the release the opensuse leaper

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,740
people would take so on one side we had

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,220
something which would be already

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,720
released table but on the other side we

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,950
had something which would be released

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:28,850
soon but not it's not yet but it would

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:31,490
be used by opensuse and the con side of

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,830
using three don t is that it would be

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,670
released stable by the upstream

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:41,120
community shortly before we start sebat

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:44,800
beta cycle off of sp2 so it would mean

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,920
the schedule would be a bit a bit tight

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,320
so what did we do we were unsure we knew

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,480
that three dot 18 was already in

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,990
tumbleweed so we could test that it was

00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:07,300
easy we with prepared by the battle plan

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:12,320
we created a mirror on urban service

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:15,320
building on sleet wealth the next nom

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,410
version so the opensuse chrome team is

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,690
always by catching the next version of

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,480
Nome which is in development in a repo

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:28,120
which is called poonam next and thanks

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:31,130
to the OBS feature we were able to

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,420
basically follow second on the next

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:37,760
project but rebuild it not on top of

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:41,660
openSUSE leap or on top of temple we

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,150
were on top of sleet wealth and this way

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,470
we were able to detect all the things

00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:51,110
which would break because yes there is a

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:53,870
dependency on new software which we

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,590
don't have in slit wealth so we were we

00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:00,290
would either need to in integrated

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,690
upgraded sometimes its charge we need a

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,199
new version or we would disable the

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,100
feature but with that

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,909
after a while we were able to have a

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:18,049
open Suzie version of genome built on

00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:20,809
sleet wealth sp1 when we did that we

00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:25,010
would install it on top of sleet wealth

00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:29,750
and test it yes it works fine so we have

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:32,419
a good base which is ok which works fine

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,669
which doesn't integrate all the work

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:36,740
that was done by this user people

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:45,769
runners on the gnome 3 to 10 but that's

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:50,840
ok we have time to do the backboard ok

00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:57,019
so we decided just will go to 320 the

00:17:50,840 --> 00:18:00,769
gnomes 320 then we decided also to mimic

00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:04,549
what the gnome people in opensuse are

00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:08,360
doing right now and no people but i

00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:11,630
would say i could say all the packager

00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,659
and contributor on opensuse factor we

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,940
are doing which is using a divil project

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:19,580
so he if you are already contributed to

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,519
to factory you know that you never

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,200
submit something directly to factory you

00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:29,480
have to branch from a divil project you

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,700
get your changes integrated in the devil

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,649
project and from there you send the

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:38,090
changes from the devel project to

00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:42,620
factory and we decided to start to doing

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:46,600
that for genome internally falsely 12s

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:51,080
be too so we set up a divil project and

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:55,159
we decided also to have peer review

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,080
between our desktop developers when they

00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,380
submit something somebody else in the

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,750
team is going to review what I did and

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,870
if they are ok with that then it will be

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,770
submitted to the 312 code stream where

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,950
the release manager and the

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:16,960
project manager will review the code

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:20,140
before accepting it and we also add a

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:24,970
huge task among in front of us we had to

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:31,900
repace about something like 300 packages

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:37,720
and yeah that was a challenge you can

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:42,460
say that okay updating 300 packages yes

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:47,380
that's easy okay it's simple except that

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:50,290
you had to check the difference code in

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:55,210
the codebase between what you had in

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:57,490
slit 12 so minimum 3 to 10 plus the

00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,580
feature we create it plus the bug fix

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,680
until today and all the other high on

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,310
the other side you had a genome three

00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,520
dot twenty-three dot 19 so the 20 code

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:14,710
base meaning all the changes I went in

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:19,210
opensuse since the day we branch falsely

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:23,350
12 until now in opensuse tumbleweed and

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:25,770
of course we also had to push if

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:30,040
possible so patch is the feature

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:33,670
upstream no because again our goal is

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,290
not to keep the code we write for us but

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,320
making sure it's available to everybody

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:46,840
because in the long term it's easier to

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:49,830
maintain okay so that's a pattern plan

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:55,840
was it a success

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:59,980
not entirely so for the better one of

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,910
those back too we were able to get the

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:08,020
gnomes read or 20 dot one in so it was

00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:11,170
difficult until the last minute but we

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:15,550
were able to get it in so this but we

00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:19,150
can say it was a success but again due

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:24,180
to time constraint we weren't able to

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:27,490
push back to opensuse all the changes

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,670
resulting from the merge of the slit 12

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:36,660
codebase ends tumbleweed code base by

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:42,610
beta 1 so now we are still in the beta

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:45,280
beta test phase of SB 2 and we are

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,990
really discussing heavily between this

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,260
is the developer on one side and the

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:54,550
opensuse bloom team and why didn't we

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:58,480
succeed ok have you ever tried to submit

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:02,080
changes to ignore factory with trailing

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:07,030
spaces in the changelog they will reject

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:11,110
that say check for typos say check for a

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,570
dot at the end of a sentence said check

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:19,120
for capitalization of phrases of

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:23,790
sentence no I'm kidding but that was not

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:28,960
a real problem it's just that the rules

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:33,130
the guidelines for contributing to bloom

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:37,720
factory takes a lot of time to to learn

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:40,150
and yeah so our people also the people

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:46,420
are learning that but are not that they

00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:52,120
are yet we are walking on that the next

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:55,000
step we really really really really want

00:22:52,120 --> 00:23:02,010
to merge or service back to change to

00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:06,760
factory and do it now not in six months

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:10,810
so with the help of the opensuse chrome

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:16,060
team since now the code base of service

00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:18,870
back to is a variable in OBS everybody

00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:24,220
can look at it we sink it for each beta

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:26,140
release air every milestone so the

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,060
opensuse chrome team was able to look at

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:33,160
the code stream force 40 so I respect to

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,290
make some comments oh yes there you are

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:40,090
doing crazy stuff don't do it or do it

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:45,430
in a different way and now we are

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:50,920
working together on making sure that we

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:53,640
close the gap between opensuse n NC so

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,510
that when we do changes to a code

00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,450
sometimes we will make the changes

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,830
available on opensuse because it's

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:06,610
relevant it's if it's a bug fix

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:10,000
obviously everybody wants it sometimes

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,400
it's more a design decision which is all

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,780
because we have a use case which are

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,670
reduced compared to you opensuse so we

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,760
focus on one thing we change our

00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:25,930
behavior and sometimes changing this

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:29,680
behavior is okay in enterprise world but

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,680
not in a open to the world so in that

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,070
case maybe we lose ships a patch but we

00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:40,780
won't apply it when building 44 winces n

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:45,040
our ultimate goal

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:47,800
is for the next lip and service pack 2

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:52,390
to have the same source package so the

00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:54,820
s.s rpm should be the same but building

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:58,090
those might result in different binary

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:02,530
packages because sometimes we will not

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:08,910
enable some feature on opensuse or only

00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:12,130
palm honestly and the good thing is that

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:18,010
the opensuse young team really want us

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:22,630
to succeed for a selfish reason if they

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:24,660
use the same source as sp2 they won't

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:28,180
have to take care of the maintenance of

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,090
Nome for the next leap because it will

00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:36,370
be inherited from sales back to you

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:39,250
meaning we so desktop guys Pat Susie we

00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:43,330
take care of the maintenance I'm sure

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:48,280
they will help us but now I saying no in

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:51,880
the back I know him but seriously this

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,860
means that we again community and so

00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,070
they will be able to work together on

00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:01,000
maintaining a high quality environment

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:06,220
for the Destin and right now we just

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,620
have 54 packages remaining which in

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,680
books Lee classic but don't worry it

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:16,150
will be there and we even have a stretch

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:19,990
goal getting more packages available for

00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:25,360

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,120
is respected not sure and i can tell you

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,940
that if you are using sleet where sp1

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,000

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:53,279
this monday we have KD 5 available for

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,399
skin 12 sp1 which is something people

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,970
have been asking for so again this is

00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,730
something where community and Susie work

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:08,399
and a hand to end and yeah we really

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:11,100
want to increase that you oops and with

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:21,210
that questions of my P reaction you can

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:33,809
throw me tomatoes if you want look one

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:40,200
question takashi okay turn on the mic

00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:42,539
might work better yes oh the question my

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,289
question is that what happens in after

00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:49,820
they will release of sp2 and deep 42

00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:55,639
Dodger so which whether IPS were obvious

00:27:49,820 --> 00:28:02,850
with the base of the medina's packages

00:27:55,639 --> 00:28:04,590
so we have the strict rules at IBS so

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,110
for those people who are not working at

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,970
in a Tuesday we have another abit

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,480
service which is internal which is we

00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:15,929
call IBS which is private where we will

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,330
sleep well and so how we are going to

00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:21,179
end all maintenance I would say we will

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,490
handle it dries just like we do right

00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,789
now it will be a handle internally

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:32,429
because for packages in a lip which are

00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:35,480
the same as in ensley 12 the work is

00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:37,860
done internally and then when the

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,559
maintenance teams open tues maintenance

00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,480
team enters through the maintenance team

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,799
decided to release a package then it's

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:52,049
available outside but we are able to

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:55,670
fetch changes from obs so if a community

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:58,790
member do a bug fix for package

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:02,350
you can make it available for us to pick

00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:06,080
on OBS and we'll just pick the changes

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,870
push that in IBS and then it will be

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,350
pushed through the regular maintenance

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,620
channel 2 on one side slit 12 sp2 and

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:19,250
other the other side the next clip we

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:25,180
really want to prevent divergence code

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:25,180
divergence just like we had and yep

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:35,300
other questions no we are a bit late

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:41,270
compared to the schedules I still have

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:45,250
