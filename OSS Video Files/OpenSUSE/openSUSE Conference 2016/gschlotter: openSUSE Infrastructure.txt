okay hello and some of you may know me

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:19,480
or not that's why I shortly introduce

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:23,560
myself I'm GAD slaughter I'm at this

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,590
loser for nearly 45 years and I am

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:32,169
working as in opensuse admin since two

00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:35,110
years you can reach me for in the air is

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:37,840
see under if slaughter in some channels

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:42,400
like opensuse admin and opensuse mirrors

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,250
and also permits will give LaTourette

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,810
opens to the orcs with a calm and so on

00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:52,720
for the first point of the

00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:58,240
infrastructure would be who are the

00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:02,620
people who made all this stuff so we are

00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,720
I give you some names Marcus records who

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,009
is a who seems not to be here today

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,560
sadly also known as starix I think one

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:20,979
of the longest opensuse admin members

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:22,630
then last folks who is my boss and he

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,600
also provides the monitoring for

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:31,299
opensuse and also fixes lot of stuff for

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:35,290
the service next one is till he is our

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,810
practical air one of our products he is

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,369
the master of all this puppet and salt

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:46,090
stuff we are running there then we have

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:48,340
our the intruder he must be here

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,740
somewhere true he's like the OBS

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:56,080
mastermind so if something is related to

00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,610
obvious he's like one of their contact

00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,330
eyes the next one on the list is Hannah

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:06,700
Vogelsong he is the mailing list

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:12,989
administrator and the guy responsible

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:19,109
for the server there then Stefan culo

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:19,109
who is helping with the OBS and open QA

00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:29,329
then the last pro colleague Martin chai

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,459
who is doing the video stuff here today

00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:38,780
and also taking care of the mirror set

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:42,260
up in opensuse and oh yeah then look no

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,769
sir who is the guy responsible at the

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,889
moment for open QA I think many of you

00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:51,769
should know him also and there are many

00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:55,010
more people so don't blame me if I

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,659
forgot someone or didn't mention it if I

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,639
would say everyone we would see to

00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:07,969
tomorrow I think then what hardware do

00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:12,200
we run I have got some pictures from

00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:15,109
some of the server service there in our

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,790
server room from storage to build

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:25,040
workers to our VMs lots of many machines

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:28,430
are there located and some specific more

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,280
specific stuff we run at the moment were

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:37,879
fully machines last year it was around

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:42,040
17 so we moved some old ones there to

00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:48,979
some other locations I our priorities

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:53,629
around 130 build workers for em opensuse

00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:56,930
arc so obvious and open QA last year it

00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:59,799
was around 96 so you can guess where

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,829
some of the oils hardware machines went

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:08,650
and we have 16 virtual machines at the

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:11,209
moment last year it was 26 so the

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:16,070
functions that the service we moved out

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:19,009
head are now all virtualized we also

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,730
have lots of switches in use with many

00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:25,530
different VLANs

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:28,470
and we have also have a number one

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:33,420
external server called a sink opensuse

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,400
arc in a different location if worst

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,420
case in our office is completely shut

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:43,320
down and we have from souza sponsored

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,470
around 40 terabytes of FC storage so

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,570
that we can run download opensuse and so

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,840
on and we switched in the last year from

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,430
and one gigabit interconnect between all

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,190
the servers to attend gigabit

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:06,180
interconnect so that we can assume datos

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:08,280
faster and so on then we have some setup

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,630
improve oh it's a cluster of around

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:18,300
three machines on these servers run

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:22,110
services like www and Vicky lizards and

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:26,790
so on but they are not managed by his

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:33,240
own community yet we try to change the

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:39,090
next year then some of the highlights of

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,400
this services the first one is Miro

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,600
brain you should know it as Donald

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,020
opensuse arc you maybe don't notice it

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,270
because mirror brains witches him if you

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,960
try to exist on the opensuse orpheus

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,300
zipper or something else it switches it

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,390
switched to the next best mirror to of

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,390
your location so that you have a better

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,160
connection at that we don't have an shut

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,690
down because too many people are trying

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,650
to access our download server the next

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:17,630
one is the open bed service and then

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:23,810
meet in the last year it grew up it

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:27,770
minimal yeah it builds around nearly

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,770
300,000 packages in the meantime

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,140
and it started to build even s390 since

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,740
this year but not with high priority at

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,680
the moment so in like next year we will

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:47,830
be able to build opensuse completely for

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,990
s390 next one will be our battle station

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,930
platform where you have all these

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,720
standard services like software opensuse

00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:01,720
org and else running so even connect

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,290
once there it was once called Alice in

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:11,470
Wonderland's from men let's say historic

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:14,320
reason and it's planned to be a cloud in

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,630
the future so that's the people or the

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,050
community who needs a new vm can created

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:24,790
themselves there and don't need to write

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:29,770
tickets and so on then vr i still have

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:40,169
some more let's say a smaller services

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:42,760
which run there many of them are our

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:46,690
part of them are improve apart in

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,210
Limburg so the plan is in the future

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,000
that we can move all the way all the

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,520
services between pro-bono back in may be

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,400
other locations in the future when we

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,500
want or when we need it so i like if

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,680
once they say one server room will be

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,240
shut down for some reason then we can

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,600
move everything to a different location

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:13,390
and nearly have no down time to

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:17,740
completely no downtime then what is our

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:23,860
operating system ok dream on us we only

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,380
use less on opensuse but at least we

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,770
have it at the latest versions and with

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:33,460
the latest updates on it and we also

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:38,750
have around more than 400 special

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:42,349
packages only for this infrastructure

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,610
because we want to have for each service

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:49,340
and package that we can better run or

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,890
administrate his services so that we

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,350
don't need to download a tarball or

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,980
something like that or trinsic change

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:05,300
the config files after we updated the

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:08,300
service yeah okay some informations

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,600
about open QA and open and the OBS in

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:16,130
the last year there were some bigger

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,290
changes one is their main machines of

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,560
the open QA and open paid service are

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:25,370
now completely virtualized that means we

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,850
have four open f 00 BS at least at a own

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,280
cluster but Rhonda with something like

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,650
one and a half terabyte REM that the

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:39,200
obvious have enough power and open QA

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,770
got a completely new network design

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,360
because around this time last year the

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:49,820
tests couldn't even reach internet or

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,160
www opensuse org and in the meantime it

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,320
is possible it's even behind a proxy

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,240
though that we have a better secure

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:03,740
there and of course we got more workers

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,200
for them we got around I think it was

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,320
more than hundreds workers only for the

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:17,240
OBS and there must be like six or eight

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:24,320
workers for the open QA some challenges

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:27,530
for the future for us admins I have some

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,980
backup k wasn't planned then I need to

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:33,650
improvise it and one plan for the future

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,560
is to have an automated system so that

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,000
we can say we need to update everything

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,970
if you don't need to update everything

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,110
manually or even we want to set up the

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,390
new vm with the same data so you want to

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,530
have an configuration management system

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,499
for each VM online so at the moment we

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,229
still run

00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:59,699
puppet on the machines we changed last

00:10:55,229 --> 00:11:01,469
year and the future should be solved to

00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:05,369
check all the versions we also have a

00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:08,849
kid lab instance reachable via get them

00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:11,819
open to the arc where we check

00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:17,609
everything in and corrective the work of

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:20,249
the other admins then some other topic

00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:22,619
for the future is called marrow pinky

00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:26,279
which is still in work in progress there

00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:28,589
Moreau pinky should replace the work we

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,629
have with all the mirrors like retention

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:33,839
IP address can you change it in your

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:39,509
files or we need x is for an additional

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:42,629
server we need more feel and if you can

00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:46,019
we get less bandwidth and so on that the

00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:51,059
mirrors can administrate themselves in

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:54,059
the database layer and the big topic

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:58,319
which i already said is try to you will

00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:01,919
try to run cloud in the future so that

00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,869
week that the MS can be created by the

00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,220
community themselves and not only by the

00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:11,879
up mins you need to figure out some

00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,649
finding a fine last details there but at

00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:15,929
the moment it looks good from the

00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:20,489
planning and the test configuration we

00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:23,609
already had this setup should start in

00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:29,279
provo then there we also try to meet

00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:32,279
great Vicky www box allah and so on to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,139
wither to the new cluster there that we

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,789
have incomplete own hardware for

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,379
opensuse and don't need to wait for

00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:43,079
other people to have time to

00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:49,319
administrate it which we have at the

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:52,829
moment some problems there I think that

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:58,729
some of the biggest changes biggest

00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:58,729
plans for the future then

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,410
if you have some questions about the

00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:10,589
topics right now you can ask it if you

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,589

00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:16,329
pressure how is how easy is it to get

00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:20,230
involved might kill has the answer it

perspective we are willing to accept any

00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:28,480
help that we can get we have already

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:31,119
some external contributors that they are

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,449
working on fixing tickets here and there

00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:35,949
not something very big and the most

00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,540
important part problem that we have

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:39,670
right now is that we have some network

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,709
restrictions because of some asses that

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,869
are still in provo so we cannot accept

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,029
food external contributory a fully

00:14:43,869 --> 00:14:48,129
administrator because parts being inside

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,230
she said we are doing with all very good

00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:53,860
progress of moving those services

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,990
outside these are sorry this is where I

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,749
spend most of my time actually the past

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,990
two years in the in the team on posting

00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:03,879
service outside and I plan to have it

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,379
finished soon so we can actually send

00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:08,259
the way a big announcement that we can

00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:11,170
accept full external contributors but

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:13,089
even now if somebody wants to reach us

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,429
and help with administration tasks have

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:18,220
plenty of work to give to external

00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:20,529
people without even giving them full

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,119
access to something so if you can get if

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,220
you want to let us generate a season

00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:27,839
ericsson open society nor the in our

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,839
mail and we can get your help

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:43,150
yes you said that you will set up a

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:47,650
cloud do you use openstack cloud or what

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,160
kind of it will be us with a cloud as a

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:53,590
as it is planned for the moment so you

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,750
don't know based on OpenStack yes yeah

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,910
that's clear but so you don't say me

00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,820
from the opensuse community takes a real

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:11,290
openstack cloud from the OpenStack

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:14,560
community you stick okay thanks so so

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:19,900
you said you use four hundred additional

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:23,110
packages on top of / yes do you uh where

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:25,240
do you maintain those and maybe you

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:29,470
could contribute those two packaged app

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,710
or at least part of those and can you

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,650
repeat the second part please so my

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,710
question was since you have to maintain

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:42,670
for Android additional packages force

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:45,400
less which are not part of less where do

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,610
you maintain those maybe on OBS I don't

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,190
know and if so it would be nice to

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:54,490
contribute those who'll which can be

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,830
used by other people in opensuse

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,120
backboards or also known as by kesha

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:04,380
process yeah at the moment we are

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,490
maintaining them in the end Intel

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:12,190
enterprise food service which we at

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:16,600
azusa I think we can create something

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:19,449
like a project for in the OBS for it so

00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:25,180
that the community can better check

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:28,340
something like this in it and um at the

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:32,100
moment it's like

00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:44,999
we are around 10 people salvaged from

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:47,789
Kings these packages when are we going

00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:51,450
to pull the black on all the bit rotting

00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:57,859
applications that we have like the wiki

00:17:51,450 --> 00:18:01,259
the mailing lists connect wordpress and

00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:05,789
I know that you take care more of the

00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:09,389
application level but and I didn't

00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:12,029
understand it completely we're now we're

00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:16,440
going to turn off the infrastructure

00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:19,859
that isn't working anymore we just try

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,909
to have the wiki workshop in the in the

00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:30,029
in the room above and you can't edit

00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:32,190
move or whatever to a wiki page no yeah

00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:35,999
which is at the moment as special case

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:40,859
because of this bad mature going on

00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:44,429
there the biggest problem is that we can

00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:47,460
that the opensuse admins here in number

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:53,309
and sprack cannot login to wiki because

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,649
it's match for microfocus IT and so we

00:18:53,309 --> 00:19:00,539
need to do something there we need to

00:18:55,649 --> 00:19:03,539
wait for a response from them that's the

00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:07,619
reason why we try to and get it under

00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:09,679
our hands and then you will take care

00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,629
also of the application level so

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,470
problems with the actual applications

00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:19,409
and not the underlying with then we will

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,489
try to get rid of every problems we have

00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,489
there okay

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:34,350
in one of your previous slides I you had

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,120
a line OBS now knows how to be idle what

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,040
exactly does it mean because it sounds

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:53,750
an awful lot like humans know now how to

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:58,610
be lazy you mean this Lud next that one

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,610
obvious knows how to idle what is up

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:16,310
as gap has not seen to know the answer

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:19,130
before we added these other 30 workers

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,470
the old service was never idle it has

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:25,760
always had always some back rock to

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:30,110
build and outside of the Christmas week

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,390
and now that we edit these additional

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,870
workers or other sponsor these

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:38,390
additional workers i should say i guess

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,520
suddenly we have every weekend in idle

00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,460
field service which means we have really

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,480
no package that could be built which was

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,480
never the case before

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:06,250
thanks for our presentation if we

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:09,269
wouldn't have other questions I still

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,269
got have some

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:23,970
the next part of my would be I don't of

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,370
the slit either and if you have some

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,490
ideas or tips what we can do in the

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:33,090
future or which services do you think

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,710
would be best that we need to create or

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:40,290
shorts look at it if you want to create

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,290
it and use it

00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:25,600
so no one okay then if you have some

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:28,289
questions later you can join in there on

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,629
the free note ASC opensuse admin and

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,610
ping me there or write your message my

00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:37,960
client is locked in there all the time

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:43,499
so I get the message if I'm not working

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,499
