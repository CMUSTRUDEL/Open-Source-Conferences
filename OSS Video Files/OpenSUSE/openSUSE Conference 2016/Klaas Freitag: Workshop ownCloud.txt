hi I'm classf I talk um I therefore own

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,119
law today and but have a long story with

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,320
Luther and I took over heavily took over

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,500
the talk from somebody's who's name i

00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,960
forgot he wanted to do this how to run

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,180
owned Lord and opensuse and that's easy

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:39,219
enough so I can do it so what is it

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,500
about small look on the agenda actually

00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:46,120
I understood the topic like how can you

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,670
easily use on opensuse the couple of

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,000
ways to do that are supported and others

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:56,610
not and a bit complicated or not so we

00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,450
will go through all these and check some

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,059
options you might have since that is a

00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,159
bit boring maybe I want to take the

00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,460
opportunity to go a bit further and talk

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,010
about some steps we like to do with on

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,710
Claude and opensuse and I already did

00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:18,880
and also maybe name some challenges that

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,159
we experienced over the last more than

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:28,600
four years that i am with jean-claude

00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:30,610
know so how do we run on clothes on an

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
open to the server the server

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,299
installation of old law can be of course

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,869
done by a simple top oil installations

00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:41,710
similar to what i did in the mid-90s on

00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:44,860
my LST linux distribution back in the

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:49,420
days yeah right unpacking a tarball not

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:52,570
working so on and so on I had to learn

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:57,850
that web developers like to do with it

00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:00,130
still today yeah how is it done you

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,759
unpack the top oil try to configure your

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,729
web server to where you are do stuff

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,810
handle permissions and that's not really

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:12,730
working it smelt it say yeah we have a

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,680
lot of talk about that or you can do it

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,900
and for some reasons some people really

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,450
prefer this way of installations

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,900
of course from the perspective of a

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:30,430
proper linux distributions we don't

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,530
recommend it so what we of course want

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:39,659
to do is instead install from RPM

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:43,890
packages that is also challenges because

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:48,220
packaging web applications is hard

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,290
because web developers tend to add a lot

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,139
of the party dependencies that are not

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:58,629
really properly packaged on opensuse or

00:02:53,139 --> 00:03:00,909
any other Linux distribution it is

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,519
difficult to handle all the

00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:06,760
configuration options on Claud

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,079
especially on Claud server is running in

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:14,769
a lot of different configurations like

00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:17,680
different databases and and different

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:20,290
memory caches and stuff like that and if

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,099
you try to package that properly you end

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,709
up with a huge amount of different

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,139
options and different sub packages that

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,109
people need to install to get this or

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:35,199
that configuration running and we tried

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:39,069
all that during was sitting here was

00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:42,790
going through a long history of changing

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:46,239
land and fiddling with packages and we

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:50,169
got a lot of a bad feedback about that

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,590
works so at one point we went back to a

00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:58,810
very simple and other flexible approach

00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:01,750
that is to server packages they

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,280
basically just install files to where

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:08,470
they belong like server something um and

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,799
a very minimal configuration option for

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,930
Apache and that's one package that just

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,459
installed the files and the other

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,070
package is including dependencies

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,990
specific opensuse dependencies why do we

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,389
have a package with our dependencies the

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:30,000
reasoner's in enterprise environments

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:33,080
people don't want packages to pull

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,569
arbitrary dependencies lie

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,150
they use engineers and then the package

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,879
pulls Apache which is bad and then the

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,310
admin has problem and stuff like that so

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,620
for the power enterprise customers

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:53,620
especially we came up with very simple

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:56,930
just fired based packages so on via

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,120
download on load art there's this page

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,949
that you probably own ovum will be as

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,520
well you can pick the the packages for

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:11,449
the distributions that are important we

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,849
use would be s from day one to provide

00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:18,110
packages for customers and for the

00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:20,030
community and we also have no a lot of

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,500
experience with cosplay foam packaging

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:27,949
which works very nicely and yeah

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:31,729
actually is i don't i don't know another

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:37,669
way of doing this work without OBS it's

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:40,069
actually a great we have this packages

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,919
that don't download on loud arc so we

00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:46,430
are not using the download form opensuse

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,289
anymore the reason for that is basically

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,379
that we wanted to have download numbers

00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:53,020
of the packages and usage statistics how

00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:56,210
meant how many people use which

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,629
distribution and stuff and since OBS is

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,440
not providing this data we were at some

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:10,370
point driven to go away and create our

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:13,250
own repository server okay that was so

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:17,960
yeah here is the replacement repository

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,539
setup that we had in OBS it is it was

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,639
also a long learning curve how we can

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,580
set up all these repositories that we

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,060
needed all these are subprojects of is

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,129
beyond claude community we started over

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,569
voice for top five that was when when i

00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,500
joined on cloud and started the

00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:38,529
packaging and went over five and six and

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:43,100
created all these major versions

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:45,740
underneath this community project

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,710
on the other the major version numbers

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,540
plus the testing repository so users can

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:58,070
choose between stable repositories like

00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,950
a tool or the nightly builds that we

00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,180
automatically packaged up and build

00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:07,100
every night and all of the testing

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:14,210
releases which are better and our seas

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:16,310
and stuff yeah of course this is a

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,730
workshop I mean if you if you have

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,990
comments or questions also just speak up

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,610
please that's that's cool so this is a

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,420
different story this is about the zoom

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:32,630
climb the zoom client is a cute based

00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,490
software which needs to be compiled in

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:39,170
opposite to the server which is just

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:41,690
plain scripting um and compiling is more

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:45,890
difficult because its arch dependent and

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,890
everything and as you see here this is a

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:53,240
piece of OBS injured of OBS that didn't

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,830
fit vertically so I flipped it and you

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,240
see all the distributions I'd be

00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:02,120
building in OBS for customers that

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,660
starts with center is six yes we put a

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,150
cute five based software on st. 26 and

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,350
also seven and DB ends and fedoras and

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,650
there and up to all flavors of opensuse

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:18,050
of course so we gained a lot of

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:24,410
experience with cross platform building

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:27,340
and I can show how we do it maybe let me

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:34,240
check unfortunately my computer was

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:34,240
putting the big summer so let's see

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,910
it's not you

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,370
one second

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:20,430
champions box integration two things

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:32,310
client of yours let's look into this

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:35,820
backfire where is it and sorry I hit the

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,100
preferred a prepared everything but the

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:44,700
example crash it's going to be so of

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:46,650
course we don't want to so the cost

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,750
platforms back fights are pretty complex

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:53,730
you know that you need a lot of ifs and

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:56,820
and distinctions between is it an own

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,279
load line or not because as you might

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,710
know that the own law client comes white

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,930
labeled for customers so you can have a

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,880
for example CERN has a certain box

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,360
that's not an uncloudy line it's a

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,330
certain box so we have a pretty decent

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,190
way of customizing the whole thing so

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,900
that it has different logos and

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,210
different texts of course in the

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,980
different name and safe locations and

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,050
everything is changing is changeable and

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,970
in addition to that we have a tool it's

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,970
called own render that gives the

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,980
customers the opportunity to maintain

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,190
their brandings by themselves in a web

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:40,010
application pretty nice customer service

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,360
that people can use if when they buy a

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:47,760
Enterprise subscription they get access

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:50,370
to this bed tool to maintain the bonding

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,930
and also built a client's so how can we

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,520
do that of course we don't want to

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:58,950
maintain a 150 spec files for each of

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,760
these landing customers and so we have a

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:05,900
little machine behind it that takes the

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,119
bonding and the templates big file and

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,459
mumbles everything together and

00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:15,729
swaziland tuned and we'll be s of course

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:18,939
this is not the loser will be s anymore

00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:23,769
but our private instance because I get

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:25,839
the feeling that we that we yeah the

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:29,979
edits not okay to build so much software

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,619
on OBS for commercial customers and also

00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:41,229
it it wouldn't be allowed I think from

00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:45,609
the OBS idea so this templating works

00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:47,669
with us is a simple templating engine as

00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:50,049
you see here we don't we don't call it

00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,149
ownCloud client it's called shortname

00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:55,089
client and this short name template

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,949
thing is replaced by the actual name for

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,199
example cern boxes then a short name

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:02,549
Sirhan box and you then the package name

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:06,999
is named in the end of a sandbox client

00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:09,639
yeah okay and this cause platform spec

00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,469
file of course I don't know who who

00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,109
tries to maintain something

00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:18,239
cross-platform you will end up with a

00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:20,919
lot of statements like here long if

00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:23,769
centers version equals blah blah and

00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:26,889
blah blah blah blah so what usually

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:29,019
happens is like that you changed I have

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,899
to change provides of acquires package

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,909
names are different or features are

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,929
different and all kind of that and then

00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:42,179
you end up with this pretty complex spec

00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:45,999
file it looks ugly is ugly but it gives

00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:48,129
still provides a lot of power I mean

00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:50,679
we're building hundreds literally

00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:59,759
hundreds of packages with this spec

00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:59,759
fight so it's it's really powerful okay

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:13,870
okay so this is about now the only

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,910
client the right way to do it of course

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,310
would be to maintain not not as

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:24,220
maintaining like the client in our

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:26,230
private environment especially about the

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,500
community version it should be s

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,780
downstream as possible so I worked on

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,190
that for I don't know I'm almost a year

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:38,650
I think but finally today I made another

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,690
pull request to a factory so that we

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,370
have their own cloud client then for

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,450
zoos are maintained in opens was

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:49,060
effectively if you want to help i am

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,350
happy to receive any help because it's

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,970
not easy to get such a cross-platform

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,860
spec file into opens was effectively

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:03,640
that the woods are strict and it's not

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:06,910
easy to get to it this this pull request

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,460
was already declined but maybe I get it

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:13,350
through and then we can then we will

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:16,030
have our is V on Cloud Desktop

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:21,610
repository that we use for the community

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:24,790
builds as a devil devil project for the

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:29,170
decline in factory I personally would

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:33,790
say that's very nice of course I like

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,400
the idea of using OBS finally there's

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,040
the the I set that we have a white

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,250
labeling for for the client so what we

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,950
could do is we could create an open

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:50,080
through the pounding of the client so

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,770
that every user that who installs on the

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,250
desktop client from opens water gets a

00:14:52,770 --> 00:15:00,970
green branded opens wizard like looking

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,720
client I'm happy to do the technical

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:08,470
side but I'm very bad at edge design and

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,520
and stuff and icons and so on so if

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,860
anybody is interested in

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,050
work on the theming please contact me

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:19,640
and then we create can creator through

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:29,120
the branding and have a nice rendered

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:34,010
client on opensuse okay so let's talk

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:37,370
about it challenges a bit um building

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,500
packages is really challenging not only

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,260
for server also for client that we end

00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:46,190
up with literally hundreds of packages

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,410
on a ton of of distributions and it's

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,560
really hard to to get everything right

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,920
and you always end up with a missing

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,670
file on debian or I don't know some

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:02,390
flake set in the wrong way and in the

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:06,050
build fails and all these things so it's

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:10,940
really like a sec first word to maintain

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:13,400
all these these templates to create on

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,270
the spec files and Debian built

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,430
instructions so we don't really have an

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:23,390
answer on that yet how to test him

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:27,730
endeavour attempt to do toker based

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:30,260
install environments where we put the

00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,790
packages the try to install them see if

00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:36,020
they're fight complex and all these

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,990
things and and dependencies that always

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,350
kind of works but then it turns out that

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,470
it's still not enough so it's continues

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,410
to be hard another challenge that we

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:54,890
face this the acceptance of OBS and

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:58,460
other distributions is very little so

00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:01,910
open to users who are the unfortunately

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:06,380
the huge majority of Linux users they

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:08,959
just claim there is no ippo and we

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,620
continue to say they're the OBS you can

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,350
register this download repository you

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,959
can install import the key and then you

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:22,339
have a fully functional proper software

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,670
repository for 12 and it took us ages to

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:30,090
get people use

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:33,000
that unfortunately and davion building

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,100
in general in OBS is some pretty

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,070
challenging because the court that you

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:46,140
need an OBS is not compatible to debian

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:47,700
upstream or downstream is it it's not

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,760
comparable to a debian downstream

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,980
packaging so if you for example copy a

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,160
debian package from launch pad into OB

00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,130
as it will not work you need to put the

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,870
fights differently and fit it around and

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:05,310
stuff like that and it's also something

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:11,640
sometimes a bit um yes polish magic in

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:13,080
in this convergence good yeah okay and

00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,920
then we had challenges of course with

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,050
rebuild speeds and predictability often

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,570
behalf releases where we have to zoom up

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:26,040
with marketing and release at a certain

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:28,410
point of time and of course you cannot

00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,940
steer the build so it's not it's simply

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,790
not the purpose of the build service to

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:37,530
provide software the time marketing once

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,720
I know that and it's it's okay but we

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:44,160
had challenges with that yeah um

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:54,900
probably there more you can do we want

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:57,090
to add something I can give some more

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,030
details about how the packaging really

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,950
works if people are interested so we can

00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,150
we can do that on the screen if you

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,340
large or we can do it offline later so

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,260
basically this is a call for help so the

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,780
best with what class or you try to

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:16,260
announce what we want to achieve is that

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,880
more people take care about the packages

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,270
that we have in the build service right

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,690
now it's not yet in factory but it is in

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,330
our correct me if I'm wrong it's in our

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,130
development what is it called double

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,130
project our our own

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,940
submit request is already on the way

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,060
okay so we have some technical details

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,460
until it can go into factory and to be

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,160
prepared for a good packaging in factory

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,590
I would like to invite as many people as

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,740
possible to look over that and make the

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:53,340
package pass all the requested tests

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,490
because currently what we behave as you

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,650
support many platforms but possibly not

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,020
exactly the way that is required for

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,940
Souza factory so if there's anybody

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,370
wants to help and look there that's cool

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,460
and the other requests that i want to

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:12,270
add is especially for the debian side i

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:15,390
have a lot of DPN dipping control debian

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:18,330
rules vivian whatever files sitting in

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,010
the package and i've never seen such a

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,470
package with all the d being configured

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,480
and go into factory maybe there is

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,510
examples i would love to know about them

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,300
and learn how it's probably done so

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,990
that's that's what interesting thing

00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,750
having a real existing important package

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,460
in the Susa factory that is really

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,540
trying to be cross-platform and even

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,550
supports the the other world not the RPM

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:52,950
given in the Buddha world so if there's

00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:55,620
any help let us know all right okay so

00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:00,110
my last word is thank you for hosting us

00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:02,910
on us on on OBS that was 44 own cloud

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:07,370
for their own cloud project which which

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:10,500
always so we always put a huge value in

00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:13,590
easy installation and easy running on as

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,830
many platforms as possible and that was

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,170
also only possible because we started on

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,740
OBS and could clear white packages or

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:28,110
widely for a lot of systems we went

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:30,450
along so a long way of learning with it

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,870
and some things work nicely others not

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,240
so but in general it has helped us a lot

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,810
and being used on now an internal build

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,660
service for our

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:44,020
to build so it's a a BS in general it's

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,990
a great tool and die I really like to

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,720
encourage the community to continue

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,610
doing that it's very great great piece

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,550
of software and i really wonder why not

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,700
more projects jump on it it's a bit

00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,860
unfortunately okay thank you so much i

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,410
hope this sock was meeting your

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,340
expectations i'm not sure because it was

00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:17,980
maybe a bit off topic but if you have

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:21,120
questions just ask now okay then thank

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,120
