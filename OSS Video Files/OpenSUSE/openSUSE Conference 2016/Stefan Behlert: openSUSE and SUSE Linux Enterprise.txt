        Leap and the SUSE Linux Enterprise products share
        a lot of things in common. At the same time, they vary in a lot of
        aspects. Some of them are caused by fundamental differences in the
        philosophy and the basic properties of the projects.
        With the upcoming SP2 of CODE 12 of SUSE Linux Enterprise it's time to look at
        those differences and similarities, as the codebases will be getting closer again.
