This talk will show stories from the trenches of developing tests for SSSD and 
Samba. How we developed complete integration tests that exercise all the 
capabilities of our software and run in environments without a real network 
access, without requiring root or sudo or touching the important OS 
interfaces.

The authors of this talk work on SSSD, Samba and libssh - software that 
communicates over the network, often requires root access and communicates 
through OS interfaces. In this talk, we will show how we developed complete 
integration tests that exercise all the capabilities of our software and run 
in environments without a real network access, without requiring root or sudo 
or touching the important OS interfaces.

In addition, our goal was that the tests must be easy to develop and must run 
both locally on developer's machine as well as inside popular CI engines of 
today, like Travis or Semaphore. To meet these goals, we had to leverage 
existing testing tools, but also build new ones such as pam_wrapper or 
libpamtest to be able to test OS-level PAM authentication and authorization.

This talk will be useful for developers who write tests for software that is 
normally not easy to test -- attending the talk will show you how to test 
complex software systems in isolation.
