OpenQA is openSUSE's powerful installation testing environment. It normally tests whole ISO images that need to be mastered first it is not very straightforward to check single packages within the development process of new features or bug fixes. I'll show you how we managed to test our stuff as early as possible without mastering whole ISOs and how we enabled our developers to easily adapt existing openQA tests to changes in YaST's behaviour and user interface to be able to deliver updated openQA tests along with updated YaST versions.
