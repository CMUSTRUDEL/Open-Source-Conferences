that I actually initially drafted the

00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,519
slides of German and the thinking that

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,730
went into it was in German so I

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,740
translated it it will probably in parts

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,719
not appear entirely professional the way

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,970
it is now but I hope we get through it

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,789
properly it shouldn't matter too much

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,359
because it's a strange language stuff

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,070
anyway from from the beginning thank you

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,949
for the introduction it's actually a

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,219
very good point and I can start with

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,430
that because if the UK or parts of it

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:39,780
who knows actually ends up leaving the

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,480
European Union um it might still be in

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,450
the end part of the european economic

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,190
area so it might end up with the status

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,730
something like Norway or Switzerland

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,910
does that so that it in terms of data

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,350
protection the European Economic Area at

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,440
this point is more or less the same

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,010
shall we say and as the European Union

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,600
but it might end up and you know people

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,939
are pushing for that it might end up

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,250
having a special status you know the

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,460
best of both worlds stuff and that may

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,830
end up with you can it not being part of

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,430
the european economic area and therefore

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,640
it might well need a privacy UK UK

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,189
privacy shield because because this is

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,500
what this is about transferring personal

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,470
data in the terms of you know its legal

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:35,040
meaning two countries were not part of

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:37,229
the European Economic Area and to start

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,740
the whole thing oh it doesn't make a

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,689
whole lot of sense to me to look at what

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,140
the private shield privacy shield is

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:49,560
what it might be once it's done without

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,659
really starting with what the whole you

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,579
know what cost the whole problem why do

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,750
people have to work so hard to come up

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,469
with something so complicated why is

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,860
that there is an history a certain

00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:09,929
former legal setting that requires that

00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:12,660
and i will then only briefly spend some

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,840
time at what other ways are to try

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,390
there and we'll then end up at the

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,840
privacy shield and trying to have a look

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,630
at what not in detail but when in

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,430
principle is written there and how it is

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:32,550
supposed to work and where we stand in

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:38,100
the process the core of the problem is

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:41,880
that from an EU law perspective he was

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,010
good or the EA is good and everything

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,240
that happens within that those

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:51,090
territories is good and uniform and

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,700
assessed as okay and therefore there are

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,840
no problems with cross-border data

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,340
transfers within that area but

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,920
consequently everything that is outside

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,640
that area is what we don't know how bad

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,000
it is but that not us not knowing means

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,340
that we have to treat it as bad as

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,670
forbidden territories if you will so you

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,090
can't transfer data there unless certain

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,520
conditions are met and those conditions

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,550
there are some statutory ones not get to

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,420
those that sound good but hardly ever

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:31,440
apply and then there is the more muddled

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,850
stuff that you may have come into

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,670
contact with that are called modern

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,580
clauses and with a view to the United

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:44,430
States formerly a safe harbor principle

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:49,770
thus I harbor framework um the idea was

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:53,610
that essentially the the you was looking

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,170
for a way to counter its own the problem

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,230
that he created itself by saying

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,230
everything outside the use bad so it

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,350
gave the Commission the power to make

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,750
decisions with a capital D this is a

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,090
formal way to get there which basically

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,000
has binding power on the Member States

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:15,150
and that decision can be that in a

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,190
particular country third country on the

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,750
level of data protection afforded by the

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,460
laws the system or whatever is actually

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,949
sufficiently adequate

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,280
in comparison with what we have a me you

00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:33,630
to say that data may actually lawfully

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,910
be transferred there um the U has I'm

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,970
actually not really am speaking run

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,410
freely as opposed not really sticking to

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,120
my slides um the U has made a number of

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,340
decisions to that effect where it has

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,580
said that certain entire countries are

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,220
actually okay in terms of receiving

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,520
personal data from the you for example

00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,150
Argentina Switzerland Israel and Uruguay

00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,139
as well and some others some other well

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:08,580
I think one or two more so which kind of

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:11,130
transported those countries to you know

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,820
take part in what we like so much which

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,919
is our data protection realm in the you

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,199
and that did not work with the United

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,400
States they could have I mean you know

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,690
they could have tried to go the same way

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,699
but they did not because I'm assuming I

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,250
think nothing has ever been published to

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,409
that effect but I'm assuming that the

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,389
Commission couldn't quite come to terms

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:37,050
you know couldn't quite arrive at the

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:39,560
conclusion that the general statutory

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,630
data protection level is actually

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:50,969
comparable to the you so what they did

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:53,669
was they well creating them it created a

00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:56,310
framework and it's called safe harbor

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:02,580
for me but it's just a catch phrase they

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:04,800
created that um and what it was is it's

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,840
an adequate gee you know it was it is a

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,759
decision that basically said well the

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,699
country itself is not adequately

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:17,610
protected but if companies that process

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:20,310
data in that country will have its seat

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:23,039
in that country if they adhere to

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,340
certain principles and self-certify

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:31,830
accordingly and register for a list that

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:35,750
those you know not the country but those

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,960
companies were actually safe places

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,980
seif personal data from the EU and it

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,780
was always a bit flimsy and there had

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,300
always for years and especially in the

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,970
last five six years has been a lot of

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,520
criticisms saying that the framework

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,560
doesn't work and no one's ever looking

00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:00,440
into it and it's just a smokescreen and

00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:04,030
so on and so on and that criticism

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,530
obviously of criticism is you know

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,530
without anything else doesn't change

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:12,410
anything so we needed essentially a

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,460
court case for someone to look into that

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,860
and mr. Spence I don't know guy from

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,810
Austria probably heard of him took it

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,230
upon himself not only in this setting

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:28,010
but fairly generally to take it to

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:32,900
Facebook basically um and you know going

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,460
out down all kinds roads to well whether

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,760
you like it or not proclaim that

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:40,190
Facebook is essentially abusing the

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:45,350
users data and so on and one of the rows

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:47,540
he took is he complained in Ireland to

00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,150
the local data protection authorities

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,990
saying but because Facebook Europe has

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:57,620
its seat there and so basically said you

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,990
got to do something because Facebook

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,390
Europe you're the competent competent

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,240
authority to do something about it and

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,669
you can't just look you know at all

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,940
those wrongdoings that happen in your

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:13,340
country it's your job so and and then

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,750
the authority did look at it and came to

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,640
the conclusion that everything is okay

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:23,660
and were maybe things are not okay they

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,330
couldn't look into it because you know

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,700
the the data transfers from Europe to

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,790
the United States were shall we say

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:34,219
protected by the safe harbor harbor

00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,640
decision made by the Commission into two

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:41,210
thousand so they said well whatever we

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,969
may think there is the safe harbor

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,130
principle and we gotta stick to that we

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,640
can't make our own decisions

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:53,810
in some in some respects so so there you

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,850
have it but they recognized and I went

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,710
to the course in Ireland and the court

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:02,470
in iron said well we got to bring that

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:05,810
up to the European Court of judgment

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,370
according judgment routine court ICJ

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,660
quarter doesn't that's what it is m and

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,300
the the court came to the conclusion

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,580
that indeed the decision that is the

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,450
safe harbor framework the commission

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:24,400
decision is in fact invalid and in there

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:30,530
boy simply no longer exists its history

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:36,170
you know and what that meant was that

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:38,060
one of the the most used fundament for

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,590
transferring data to the United States

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,520
was there were they brought there by

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:45,290
gone from one day to the next space city

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,260
so ever since then people have been

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,850
trying to work at replacing the safe

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,090
harbor framework and that ends up being

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:56,230
the privacy shield we'll get to that um

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,790
as you can see in the timeline actually

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,340
when it comes to business people start

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,020
to work rather swiftly normal but

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,110
normally everything in terms of you know

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,670
au legislation takes years and years and

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,620
years and if you as you can see I mean

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,530
people have started to work on stuff in

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,290
2013 essentially but when you look at

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:19,690
the timeline it is not even half a year

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,890
after the the judgment was passed that

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,040
the United States and the Commission

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,890
agree on a draft for a replacement of

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,980
the safe harbor decision which will now

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,440
probably be the e us privacy shield

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,910
decision says the same set up

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,540
essentially it's just called differently

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,150
has different rules and people have had

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:44,270
a chance to voice their opinions which

00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:48,230
mostly have been rather critical of what

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:52,220
the draft says and latest stuff in April

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,170
and and currently negotiations are

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,750
ongoing so we're still working with the

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,500
draft that

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,270
we got in February this year but it is

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,130
known that negotiations have been

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,260
ongoing people have been working on the

00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,950
wording of the decision the draft

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,770
decision and it is currently in the

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,990
article 31 working group that's where

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:18,390
it's placed and actually really gene

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:20,760
working both times as I as I just now

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,490
see the and that features the

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,820
representative of the member states and

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,470
the article 31 version two weeks to

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,080
essentially consent to the decision

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,460
otherwise it can't be made that's what

00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,100
we stand but the plan is actually to

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,920
have some in place a final draft with

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:44,100
everyone's consent in August this year

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:47,640
so it's two months to go still and now

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:52,850
when we look at the future that the

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:55,670
privacy shield may or may not have we to

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,320
think about well what made the court

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,480
European Court of Justice actually say

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,339
that the safe harbor decision is invalid

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,940
essentially the new law prescribes that

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:11,130
if if the Commission wants to decide

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,500
that a country or a certain framework is

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,130
actually adequately protective of

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,330
personal data it needs to assess the

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:23,970
state of the law in that particular

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:28,290
country in depth compensable and the ICJ

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,790
did not say that the state of the data

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,610
protection laws in the United States is

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:36,150
bad what they said is Commission you

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,310
didn't look at it you just came up with

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,980
something without actually taking a look

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:44,760
at what you're actually deciding you

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,890
know you have to assess this you know

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,640
the laws and you didn't do that so for

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,380
that for that procedural problem alone

00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,610
the decision safe harbor decision is

00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:04,170
invalid and secondly what they said is

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:06,550
that the member states have independent

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,920
data protection authorities they have to

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,970
independent out at the core of the whole

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:17,529
thing and no commission decision can

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:21,130
restrict the decision-making power and a

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:26,350
power to investigate a case on just

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,029
because it thinks that the the state of

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,390
data protection laws in other country is

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:33,730
actually adequate that takes away from

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,610
the independence of the data protection

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:45,670
authorities so that was the second

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:50,980
problem and the result is that since the

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:54,459
safe harbor decision is gone the United

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:57,010
States is as bad the country and data

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,320
protection terms as any other country in

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:07,269
the world regardless of how it actually

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:11,370
is and all data transfers that have

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:14,500
relied on safe harbor are essentially

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,570
unlawful now we wanted it annexed there

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,370
has been I get to that but if a grace

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,459
period but that grace period ending the

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,000
end of februari so at this point you

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,910
can't you can't just transfer data

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,160
United States doesn't matter how well

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:35,790
regarded or whatever your recipient

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,790
company is you need to do something

00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:41,670
additional to be allowed to transfer

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,780
and that is I now have to briefly

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,840
mention that because they've been in the

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,730
press as well and and one of the one of

00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,530
those instruments the only influence

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,250
that the only instrument that you can

00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,920
actually control as a company or come up

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,640
with yourself use yourself is the

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,590
so-called EU modern clauses you will

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,320
probably order that it's the same thing

00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,730
as in German it's usually off start

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,820
and file by don't work it works

00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,640
differently but it's kind of like the

00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,770
shall we say equivalent of that when you

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,630
when it comes to data transfers from for

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:26,380
example Germany or France or whatever to

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:29,410
the United States but and hear hear the

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,210
differences begin at this point the

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,820
modern clauses don't relate specifically

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:36,520
to United States it's any third country

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,920
outside your european economic area so

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,960
that makes it different it's a set of

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,120
contractual clauses it looks like an

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,860
agreement it starts off it has a lot of

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,830
clauses and it ends with signatures and

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:53,080
certain appendage dependencies and and

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:56,380
you no one can like him or not there are

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:59,050
different kind of instrument so what

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,920
we've had what we've read a lot over the

00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:07,390
past months in even qualified shall we

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:11,670
say papers you know is that the fact

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:14,910
that the safe harbor framework is dead

00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:18,520
also means that the you mother clause

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,960
idea is dead that is not the case it

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,360
can't be because of us completely

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,340
differently the only thing that we can

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,100
think about is whether some of what are

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:32,920
some of the accusations that the ICJ

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:37,390
directed at the Commission kind of

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:41,200
applies by analogy to the emoticons as

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:46,210
well and that could be of course the non

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:49,840
assessment of a certain status of data

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:54,250
protection law but that is optionally

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,580
not the case because um the very idea of

00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,890
the montrose is that

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,100
in the recipient country there is no

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:06,170
adequate data protection level otherwise

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,900
you don't need them so there is no there

00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,060
is no requirement for the Commission to

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,250
assess a certain state all they have to

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,339
do is come up with a set of clauses that

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,740
in themselves or by themselves allow a

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,750
further a sufficient amount of trust

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:25,459
that the recipient company will treat

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:28,670
the person data as prescribed um so

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:31,520
there is no direct spillover and I don't

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,110
know I don't know if you've heard of

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,280
that her about that discussion there's a

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,720
lot of people say well you can't

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,690
transfer date of the United States there

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,970
is no at this point there is not nothing

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,340
no tool that you can use to make that

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,170
happen that's not true and the

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,400
authorities have admitted as much I mean

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,590
if never really liked them on your

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,080
clauses but you know the member state

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,950
authorities but they can help it because

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:59,390
it's a commission decision that at this

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:02,510
point is has a statutory power so this

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:06,170
it's expanding you know no member state

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,140
authority can say I don't recognize the

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:14,420
model class framework but those remains

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,580
remain for now but people have been

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,900
trying and there is at least one case

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:23,690
under way it seems to bring the mud

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,090
claws claws questions whatever they may

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,450
be up to the European Court of Justice

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:32,090
as well because it's the same impetus

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,250
that people have saying safe harbor

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,880
doesn't work my losses don't don't work

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,790
and the only institution that can say

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,600
that is the court so let's bring it up

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:48,050
to the court so what I can tell you is

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:55,730
for now they exist but they may not

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:57,110
forever I'll skip the alternative

00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,270
instruments by the way because they're

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,520
not really interesting of course if a if

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:05,240
an individual says like really freely

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,559
and expressly consents to data being

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,330
transferred to you now say

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,340
that over was everything but the

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:14,179
question no case as always is it really

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,639
a free an informed decision and the

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:20,059
authorities for the most part rightly or

00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:21,980
wrongly tend to assume that if it's a

00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,779
big company in the one hand and the

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,529
video on the other hand it's never a

00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,950
free and informed decision plus for the

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:32,870
most part they you know they don't

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,629
consider the privacy policies are

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,330
published on the web sites sufficient

00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:43,249
information because and in part at least

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:45,740
from what you know if you look at and

00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:47,809
I'm certainly not like a Google of

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,899
Facebook hater but if you look at the

00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:53,179
privacy policies that they publish you

00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:56,419
don't really learn a whole lot when you

00:19:53,179 --> 00:20:00,830
read that and not even my right the I

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:03,470
write those things and so yeah it's it's

00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:09,169
it's rather opaque as Boris Johnson

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:11,749
would say yes well you is opaque we all

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:17,269
know that we just today we've learned

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:19,009
that sadly um I might add and what the

00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:21,080
what the data protection authorities

00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,450
have done is they have granted a grace

00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:28,299
period up until the end of februari of

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:31,399
this year um that's gone so if people

00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:35,269
companies and thousands and thousands

00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:38,059
still do rely on safe harbor um they

00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:42,080
they actually committing a lot unlawful

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,759
act and in Hamburg the local DPA has

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,669
kind of tried to set an example by

00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,769
actually handing down administrative

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,230
fines they're not particularly high of

00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:53,570
course it's more like a symbol but they

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,059
did that to make a clear companies that

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,399
when they mean enter februari they

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:01,190
actually mean enter februari so they

00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:04,129
started proceedings in immediately

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:09,649
afterwards just to make the point so

00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:11,720
safe harbors really died I'm now on to

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:13,279
replacing or trying to replace safe

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,960
harbor was something better something

00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:20,120
that look you know the Court of Justice

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:25,040
may possibly

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:27,410
actually allow because of course the

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,150
previous a shield once it's done will be

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,240
brought up to the Court of Justice as

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,700
soon as possible by someone so that's

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,390
that's for sure it won't last unchecked

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:42,380
as long as safe harbor ass safe harbors

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:44,300
but wasn't place for 15 years and you

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,900
know the new framework will be tested I

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:51,020
am assuming within the first one or two

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,530
years of its existence now what are

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,870
people trying to do when we talk about

00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,430
replacing safe harbor or not in a formal

00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:03,500
sense and how it is structured is

00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:06,140
actually rather similar so again it will

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,020
be a commission decision with the

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:16,040
capital d binding upon the member states

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:19,370
that says that if companies comply with

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,580
a certain set of principles and if they

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,460
set up themselves in certain formal ways

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:30,710
and register for a list and do this that

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:34,190
the other self-certify themselves they

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:38,320
are suitable recipients for personal

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:42,890
data phone from the you so it's the same

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,110
basic idea as safe harbor was there just

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,250
trying to do a better job whether if

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,150
they've done that is a different

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,460
question what we know at this point and

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:56,390
i can only say we gotta be a bit

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:59,300
cautious we have an outdated draft of

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:02,390
the end of februari of this year and

00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:06,290
people are working rapidly on the whole

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,890
on the whole thing on so even though it

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,690
hasn't been published we can assume that

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,240
there is a more current state of the

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,910
graph that will at least in part look

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,160
differently so i don't know what's going

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:22,910
to be in the point she'll decision at

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,500
this point but probably the general

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,110
setup was the same and the way it's

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,710
supposed to work is a lot of stuff our

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:33,650
textbook 35th 40 pages where the

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,870
commission explains how it came

00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,200
to its decision the background of it

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:41,630
principles behind it and all that and

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,110
the actual core of the thing will be

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,900
placed in annexes there will be an annex

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,450
to that essentially contains the rules

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,280
that people need to follow and then then

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:57,080
there is a bunch of other and exists six

00:23:52,280 --> 00:24:03,970
to get all together we're certain US

00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:07,670
authorities in letter form I'll explain

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:10,430
how US law will work how it will work

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:13,430
also in context with the new safe harbor

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:17,510
principles and practice your principles

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:19,880
and what they do to control it and what

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,470
we course people have in the United

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,480
States and there are different points of

00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,330
contact and all that so it's not going

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,280
to be a treaty where you know you have

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,290
the TV cameras rolling and people get

00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,600
their fountain pens and you have flags

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,320
in the background and people sign it's

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,210
going to be it'll be a piece of paper

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,850
essentially or online I mean it's going

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:45,440
to be paper a PDF published by the

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:48,590
commission that kind of contains other

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,190
pieces of paper where us says this is

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,490
what we'll do to safeguard the entire

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:59,470
framework it's close to treaty but it

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:01,850
won't be this is one of the criticisms

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,920
essentially because this is you know

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:11,990
people say is empty promises essentially

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:15,740
um now there's two what what will happen

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:18,200
then is that if if a US company sells

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,860
certifying itself registers for that

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:26,800
list it'll be bound to the principles

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,820
that a safe harbor and X 2 contains

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,400
there will be certain checks and

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,840
safeguards I'll get to those um but it's

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,850
a cell certifying process so in that

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,300
sense it's the same thing as safe harbor

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:42,470
which of course leads to the

00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:44,180
corresponding criticism um and the from

00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,120
a European perspective what will also

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,100
remain the same

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,440
is that no matter how well or badly the

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,309
system works in the United States it'll

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,950
always be the company in Europe which

00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,540
remains responsible for what happens

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,730
with the data they remain responsible

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,020
for the decision to transfer the data to

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,600
the United States and if things go badly

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:13,559
they've gotta stop it so they can't say

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,270
well we have everything right what

00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,420
matters what will matter is that the

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:21,840
result remains right and if it's not

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,280
it's going to stop but that's that's

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:32,760
nothing new either that's the same thing

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:36,059
as well as we had prior to 2015 so in

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,510
terms of what the US companies have to

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:41,580
do have to comply with not that much

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,410
changes is more wordings and the

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,460
principles are more detail but the

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:52,410
general weighted way to handle this is

00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:54,360
the same what does change is the at

00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,240
least on paper of course the commitment

00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,300
of the United States government to

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:07,340
actually look out for the system to

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:11,880
control it and to get there shall we say

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:15,090
the U has has required on from their

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,100
perspective a lot of information on how

00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,110
things work in the United States in

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,780
particular of course with a view to the

00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,990
intelligence community so I would say

00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:28,020
and they have received information now

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,970
of course we can debate for months and

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,910
months months where this information is

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,610
telling sufficient detail enough but

00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:38,429
they have received 1020 pagers by

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:42,450
various authorities explaining certain

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:45,059
things and you know how we go back to

00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,420
the accusation that the Commission has

00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,620
not did not assess the state of the data

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,600
protection laws in the United States

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,200
when it did safe harbor that's

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,680
essentially the way that by which they

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
can

00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,920
the Commission wants to make sure that

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,100
this time it has assessed the situation

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,040
with sufficient comprehensiveness so

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,010
that's that's what they do to protect

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:14,460
themselves against the try to do to

00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:17,090
protect themselves against the against

00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,490
you know experiencing the same result

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:24,750
you know before the court another time

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,250
say a second time and that was one of

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,870
the elements there was missing in safe

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,870
harbor safe harbor was really nothing

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,030
now what they were trying to do when

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:40,890
setting up the principles is they were

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:44,880
trying I use the word try on purpose try

00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:48,020
to mirror reflect essentially the

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,580
current data protection directive that

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,590
forms the basis of all the national data

00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,600
protection laws in Europe at this point

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,480
I will get something else in two years

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,680
but for now that's the way it is so

00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,770
they've tried to come up with a set of

00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:07,460
principles a set of you know what do I

00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:10,320
have to do or what do I can I not do

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,190
internal company and they'll right

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,290
there's simply a list and I don't think

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,680
it would be particularly fruitful to

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:23,820
really have an in detail look at this

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:26,370
point what the principal's want to

00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:31,100
achieve and they don't but they want to

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:35,030
achieve is essentially you know kind of

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,230
transferring our our principles or

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,340
regulation on data protection to the

00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:44,280
United States which will never work but

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,520
it's an attempt but when you're reading

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:50,220
of this but when you compare it to what

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,190
we have in Europe you it takes five

00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,890
seconds to notice that it is not

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:59,190
congruent it is not the same thing

00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:02,940
there's a lot of gaps a lot of

00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:05,670
contradictions at this point the way

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,960
it's drafted at the moment I you know

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,590
I'm sticking my head

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:16,289
but I predict that it will never pass

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:18,210
and I CJ test but then again people have

00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:20,460
I'm not the only smart guy in the room

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,700
so people have seen it and I know that

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,230
that people are working on a text as we

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,350
speak and they have for the past three

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,870
months so this is not the final state of

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:38,730
things though lovely more work done on

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:41,250
that because of course the the the day

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,169
protection people in Europe if it only

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:45,690
took a couple of days essentially for

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,929
people that I realize that there's a lot

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:52,409
of things to be criticized and just some

00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,630
of those some of them are kind of like a

00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:57,840
principle almost political nature and

00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:00,570
other criticisms are really only from

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,130
foot from lawyers shall we say but

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,049
they're not less important when it comes

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:08,580
to actually working with with the thing

00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:12,480
in your life what they're saying is it

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,970
the whole thing is just super

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,059
complicated you've got to skip back and

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,299
forth to find stuff and you know from a

00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:23,010
scientific perspective that may not be

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:26,820
so bad so it's just a bit more work but

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,220
you'll find it but in practice that's a

00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,620
bad thing for a statute and it

00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,520
essentially it isn't statute you've got

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,980
a you have to be able to apply it to a

00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,890
real-life situation without taking two

00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,529
hours to find the different bits that

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:47,970
you need to qualify situation so it's

00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:51,450
just simply badly drafted even worse the

00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:54,840
terminology doesn't fit at all with our

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:57,750
data protection terminology and even

00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,750
worse um it's inconsistent in

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,770
contradictory at least in the current

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:07,380
breath in itself there's stuff that

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:10,140
simply doesn't go together there is a

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,990
choice principle which is not a choice

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,360
principle bud and opt-out option which

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,460
is not quite the same and then you don't

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,240
know when you can exercise it for

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,830
example

00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,910
and one of the things just to give you

00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,590
an example one of the things you're

00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:26,490
supposed to help out of be able to out

00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,770
of is to say I want no onward transfer

00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:33,040
you know if if you US company receiving

00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:36,100
certain data about me I want to say

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,890
that's fine but you can't transfer that

00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,260
data onwards to someone else for

00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,470
whatever reason I can opt out of that

00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:46,900
now you gotta ask the question why do I

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,170
actually have have to opt out of it does

00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,450
that mean if I don't opt out is it

00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:54,670
lawful to transfer the data on words and

00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,650
if yes why on what basis should that be

00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:04,420
the case I mean then you look at another

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:07,240
principle that says well you can only do

00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:10,030
stuff as data if it is within the

00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,870
original purpose for why you collected

00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:16,360
the data in the first place so those

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,390
things don't really go together if I say

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,660
that I have a purpose limitation how

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:25,030
would I ever or in most cases how why

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:28,179
would I be allowed to transfer data on

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:32,050
words why should someone have to opt out

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:33,550
of something that well according to

00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,620
one's principles shouldn't be lawful in

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,170
the first place so there's a lot of that

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,480
stuff you can do ten or fifteen within

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,130
two minutes if you you know if you look

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,920
at it with an experienced lie so there's

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,540
a lot of work to be done and those

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,770
things they're not they're not petty

00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:53,140
business there it's one thing to like

00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,660
something on a political level or an

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,940
abstract level and you can discuss

00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,580
whatever but if you have a set of legal

00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,610
rules that you cannot apply you can

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,950
simply forfeit the political discussion

00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,809
because it is not simply not going to

00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,909
work and as we stand I don't think it's

00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:15,909
going to work regardless of whether I

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:18,820
like it or not now again they say

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:22,330
Commission you can't just you can't do

00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:24,310
your job assessing how things work in

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:28,810
the United States by letting other

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:30,649
people tell you how it works you have to

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,029
look at it yourself

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,099
the letters that receive the

00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,839
representations that receive don't do

00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:41,349
the job so that's another criticism

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,819
which will play a role in a assumed

00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:51,770
court case because that was the reason

00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:57,529
why I safe harbor or shut down there is

00:34:51,770 --> 00:35:02,510
no agreement at this point of when do we

00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:04,579
apply the whatever us set of data

00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:09,529
protection rules to a case and when do

00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:12,349
we apply European set of rules and a lot

00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:14,480
of work has gone into that very question

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:19,430
when they came up with free data

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,339
protection directive in 95 and and now

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:24,200
we have the data protection regulation

00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,849
which has actually entered into force

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,880
and will be applicable in two years time

00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:33,559
a lot of thought has gone into that and

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,480
the princess shield doesn't simply kind

00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:40,819
of it steps away from that question but

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:42,170
that's a very core question because if

00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,390
you're an individual and you want to

00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:47,059
take recourse to someone you have to

00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,980
tell the court why you on what set a

00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:53,390
rule on which basis you want to do that

00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:56,779
it is something that I think to make it

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:58,789
work you'd have to require the form the

00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:02,390
framework to provide a solution for that

00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:05,000
question otherwise you know the judicial

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,670
recourse that they want to establish

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,710
simply how's that supposed to work and

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:13,220
it'll make everything very difficult

00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:17,000
very complicated and very risky for

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:21,880
anyone to claim their rights so that's

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:26,510
another criticism right there they say

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,819
you know critics say that even though we

00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,670
you know the Commission has received

00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:33,710
information on how the intelligence and

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:37,270
on what basis the intelligence community

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:39,810
United States essentially draws data

00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,520
it's still not enough

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:44,220
we still don't know enough now that's of

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,610
course never going to change for honest

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:51,690
so that criticism will never disappear

00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:54,900
for reasons of logic there is no there

00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,550
is no rule on when data actually maybe

00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,950
actually at some point has to be deleted

00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,610
because you know you collectives for

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:04,230
some reason and that purpose normally

00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,290
expires at some point no one ever

00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:11,000
deletes data at least God if they don't

00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:11,000
if aren't forced to so that's a problem

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:18,270
and the other my sister's a bit specific

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,870
shall be saying I'll skip that so now

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:28,260
what will happen um of course I don't

00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:30,330
know um as I said the representatives of

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,900
the member states still have to consent

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,460
so whatever draft we end up with we

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,420
don't know that after yet you don't know

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:42,300
what improvements may have been made but

00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:47,160
if but ice but I expect and it usually

00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:50,160
happens on EU level member states will

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,620
consent in the end because you know they

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,210
spend so much energy on the regulation

00:37:52,620 --> 00:38:01,610
that's taken four years to finalize that

00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:04,530
I don't think that anyone will really

00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,990
you know deny the Commission their

00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,630
consent because that would mean that you

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,000
know from a business perspective people

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:15,600
would run into huge problems and that on

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,490
the 11th century won't happen so there

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,750
will be consent so it will probably have

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:21,210
something I don't know if we have

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,440
something by August but this year

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:30,180
probably will have a you know improved

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,690
safe harbor to and once that's in place

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:37,710
is finding you can use it you as a

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:39,390
company you can rely on it but on the

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,130
first day it's in place people will

00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:44,940
start people will again try to shoot it

00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:48,840
down and if it does not change

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,910
fundamentally it might well be said you

00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:55,599
know shot down within the first 12 years

00:38:51,910 --> 00:39:00,089
because you know the reasons that the

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,829
ICJ gave provides the fishing ground if

00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:06,789
you apply them strictly to shoot that

00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:09,880
down as well and the court doesn't have

00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:15,930
to go into the details you know it's

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:19,059
just the the the directive calls for a

00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,400
comparable level of data protection in

00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:22,780
the two countries involved you will be

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,260
one the one hand and the recipient

00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,690
country any other hand and that simply

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,039
is not the case it's not comparable I'm

00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,079
not going to say it's worse or better

00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:34,750
that's that's that's a debate for

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,609
another day but it's certainly not

00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,339
comparable so if that's if that's the

00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:42,400
test comparability it'll fail that's

00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:46,780
what I believe in East so the bottom

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,599
line is our today and in one year's time

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:54,430
in two years time I think that it'll be

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,349
and remain very difficult to transfer

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,450
data into the United States and other

00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:01,029
countries by the way but we always focus

00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:04,119
on the United States you know for

00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:07,809
historic reasons it'll remain difficult

00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,099
and leave in terms and companies and but

00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:11,230
they have them in the past and I'm sure

00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:12,400
they will do in the future as well

00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,890
they're willing to take that risk

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,670
because you don't have a choice the

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:22,150
question of course is product wise will

00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:25,119
we have will the consumer or the company

00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:28,539
customer of well alternative products

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,289
that essentially you know offer the same

00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:34,299
or comparable quality and range and

00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:39,010
because when we look at it the reason

00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:41,440
why that at least for most people hasn't

00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:44,049
been the case is because you know the

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,789
competition doesn't work essentially so

00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:47,559
that would be no no one we wouldn't be

00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:49,690
talking facebook and google this of that

00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:51,789
if there was an alternative you know

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:56,319
there isn't anything since it hasn't

00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:57,470
been I don't know but um that

00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,070
essentially is a reason

00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:03,050
behind the whole problem because from a

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,410
from a company's perspective of course

00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:10,010
that's an attorney's perspective as well

00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:11,390
is at this you know this at this point

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,240
most companies say I don't have a choice

00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:17,510
I simply don't have a choice in business

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,170
terms I have to for example starbucks i

00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:23,330
want to use Amazon Web Services give me

00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,160
something else but I don't know it I'll

00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:29,030
just use it because everyone else does I

00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,210
know it works supposedly so that that's

00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:34,250
that's that won't change now previously

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,470
shield whatever it's going to be the

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,940
same the same question and the only

00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:42,650
solution really lies you know in

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,010
competitive products really and we'll

00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:49,190
see where we end up no one knows at this

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:53,030
point so I thank you for your attention

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:57,109
I know it's not it's not for everyone

00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,490
that stuff but you've been quiet so I

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:04,420
thank you for the happy could have been

00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:04,420
typing well and thank you for having

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,270
