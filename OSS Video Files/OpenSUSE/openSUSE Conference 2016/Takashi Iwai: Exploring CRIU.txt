CRIU (Checkpoint Restore In Userspace) [*] is a tool for freezing and restoring user processes to/from a disk image.  It can be seen as a kind of "software suspend" per process.

This talk will show the basic design and usages of CRIU, the recent development and adaption by containers, and study a bit details about its implementation in kernel and user-space, as well as a short demo.
