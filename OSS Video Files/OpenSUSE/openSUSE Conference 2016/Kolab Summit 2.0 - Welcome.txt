	00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:12,809
good morning everyone and welcome to the

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,139
second call up summit here in a very hot

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:18,300
number we decided to leave the black

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,699
things on the windows because that gives

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,820
us better chances of not dying of heat

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,400
stroke during the day it also makes

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,080
doing very cozy in bar like which is

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,369
kind of fitting since you see over there

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,719
all the collab taster outfit we have

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:36,180
including the demo stations and the

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,550
noise which has now been slightly

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,050
reduced in fact heralds the coop summit

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,980
and some of the things we want to talk

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:50,430
about since it kemps comes from the

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,620
power 8 server we have with us so

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,660
there's an actual live power 8 machine

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,579
here it runs call up over Wi-Fi we're

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,930
connecting those little demo stations

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,369
that you see there so you can actually

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,950
live try call up on power as it runs all

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,420
of this is real it is life it is there's

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,000
no you know it live demos have a certain

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,780
reputation the tech industry we go for

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,500
it anyway because that's who we are so a

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,400
few logistics to to begin with um you

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,670
see those wonderful red bottles they are

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,759
for I was told everyone who has signed

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,829
up to summit call up the dork sign up

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,900
there and you get a bottle and in fact

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,640
spread the word about that as well we

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,369
also encourage you everyone grab

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,790
lanyards run around with them and invite

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,579
people in so people know where to go to

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,520
get all the knowledge about call out the

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:55,140
program for today is mostly on the

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:59,119
technical but also some legal side um we

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:04,590
have Aaron who will be talking to us

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:08,069
shortly in in the tech realm and our CTO

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,819
and cycle many of you who've been in the

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,080
KDE world as well know him rather well

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:15,360
he's going to give you an idea of

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,650
where we are technically and where

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,020
things are going and after that I'm very

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,260
very happy that we can welcome dr. Maya

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,690
from IBM director of how to research in

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,520
burb Lincoln and he will talk to us

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:35,220
about power but power the future um so I

00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,600
asked him um to also make it a little

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,700
bit more technical for this audience

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:44,820
today um because well you know this is a

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,280
geek event we're once more hosting it

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,250
together with the opensuse community so

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,900
I figure Tech is good and I hope you

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,030
hear all about nanotechnology and

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,290
nanotubes and and all the problems that

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,360
you have from you try to make things

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,240
smaller and faster and you know have

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
them all you know run even faster I mean

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,740
we'd also have followed the hardware

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,230
world have seen that intel has now

00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,440
started to reduce the clock right on its

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,480
chips again over the past year so we're

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,820
hitting physical limits like actual

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,620
physical barriers in the way we've

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,930
designed these things so now we need to

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,820
find better in new ways and that's

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,350
exactly what we were here about so I'm

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,600
very very happy that you're here with us

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:29,790
thank you very much and also you can

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,480
happen has also here with us to give us

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,280
a legal perspective which I mean we

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,530
didn't plan it this way but especially

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
today seems to have a certain

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,280
undercurrent since he's going to talk

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,850
about EU legislation we all know that

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,600
safe harbor is dead privacy shield is

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,519
about to die kinda like there's a

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,320
certain expectation that it won't really

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,000
last very long and of course today

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,030
social media are more interesting than

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,130
on many other days even that the whole

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,970
brexit referendum has surprised quite a

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,850
few bookkeepers um so everything is up

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,690
in the air the question is where will

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:19,260
the pieces fall um we hope to give you

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,620
some answers on that at least from the

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,920
things we can see and we know and to

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,460
talk about building the technology

00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:36,120
that actually can give you confidence in

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:39,540
collaboration back and that requires the

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,700
entire spectrum right from the hardware

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,430
you need hardware that is open

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,020
transparent powerful but actually

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,840
something that you could verify built

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,970
yourself innovate upon that's the power

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,110
story you need the operating systems I

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,790
mean we are here with the Zulu

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,060
conference loser runs perfectly in power

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,640
always has right Souza actually has its

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,370
origins more in that field then on the

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,090
internal hardware so I'm zuza and redhat

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,410
both run on power perfectly well and

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,810
then of course you have the solution on

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:15,480
top which is colon obviously so that's

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,920
kind of the the program for the day

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,830
hands to heart will then close it off

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,690
with a niche market perspective one of

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,360
our long-standing partners from the

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,970
Netherlands he in fact has worked with

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,420
us also in the health care sector and

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,650
has been working a lot on the previous

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,740
collapse salmon for those of you who

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,600
were there because he organized or was

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,400
one of the organizers of the opensuse

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,770
conference in The Hague where we

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:49,200
co-located this for the last time that's

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,290
it and since we feel that's kind of

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,720
enough in terms of talks right we figure

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,460
we take this outside since the weather

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,830
is wonderful I mean up until last week I

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,330
made the joke that this summer is kind

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,140
of one of the hardest winters we've seen

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:10,110
in a while um but this week that seems

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,220
to have changed very radically so let's

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,010
make the best of the end and actually

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,330
have some barbecue and beer outside I

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,630
mean it's a wonderful lovely area there

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,060
so from four o'clock Leisha right for

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,860
clock from four o'clock onward have you

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,930
all invited as our guest to just you

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,660
know have some sausages some need some

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,790
beer enjoy life you know talk to each

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,780
other and when you want to cool off a

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:35,460
little bit you just come back in and

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,910
play around with call out there's all

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,750
these demonstrations also ask every one

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,550
of us

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,470
at any point in time about things that

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,630
you are interested in I mean we have a

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,160
large part of the whole app team here in

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:51,380
fact quite a few people who are very

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,580
significant contributors I should say

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,100
starting from Erin of course we will

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,370
speak shortly but then your own just

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,730
wave once place is our senior architect

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,430
he is the guy who thinks about how the

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,950
puzzle pieces go together meds behind

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:12,170
them is our technical team manager we

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,170
have Christian all the way in the back

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,169
exactly who is leading our desktop

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,150
client so currently of course contact

00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:25,280
based on Katie pin but we're gonna hear

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,870
the exciting things about cube um I

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,240
shouldn't ask you from stage but maybe

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,400
you even get to see something during

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,550
these days that'd be wonderful because

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,020
cube has really developed nicely on we

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,169
have quite a few things to show already

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,790
and those of you have not subscribed to

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,680
his blog i would recommend that you do

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,090
all just go and call out the door can go

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,310
in the blog section where you find it

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,900
aggregated i like of course as well as

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,320
is also here we didn't even say hello

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,960
yet you must have snuck in when when I

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,930
wasn't paying attention who's working

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,850
for on the web client drunk you and of

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,430
course roundcube next is also something

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:04,050
that for us is very important so there's

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:07,860
a few things that we have to talk about

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,990
the technical side and therefore I hope

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,540
that all of you will enjoy this and will

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,270
spend this day with us get interactive

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,120
engage with us collaborate with us I

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,919
mean for us this is an interactive thing

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,290
right i mean this is not supposed to be

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,530
a we stand here all day and just give

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,630
long speeches but a let's get into some

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,510
sort of exchange with each other so

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,020
therefore please you know just ask

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:38,870
questions be interactive um get engaged

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,870
and collaborate thank you very much

00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:52,149
all right once Aaron is ready which I'm

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,920
sure he's going to be in a moment I

00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,920
think we'll just switch straight over

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:52,010
great so let me just get this

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:54,860
presentation back to you slide 1 great

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,180
so we're going to be talking about yes I

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,710
have to wonder what are two people might

00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,660
find that has stepped a little bit

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,960
humorous so we're gonna be talking about

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,930
initially the technical future and

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,430
roadmap of colab we did this at the last

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,190
moment as well gave try to give

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,200
everybody an idea where we were going

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,760
and where we were and so this is

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,980
becoming a regular thing in the summit

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,150
which is good and hopefully will give

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:25,190
you a very nice idea of where we are now

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:30,010
as well I'm going to see if I can see if

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,010
this baby works oh it does beautiful

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:37,700
because now I can roam great so the

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,590
technical roadmap this year it was

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,030
interesting at last year or we talked

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:45,320
about what we were planning technically

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:48,350
we talked a lot about features and we're

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,760
removing the technology and and this

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,110
year the presentation is we're going to

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,760
be talking about features as well and

00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,130
what we're doing new but we're actually

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,730
going to be starting with the results of

00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:01,070
a lot of work that we put in in 2015 as

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,700
well as this year that I've started to

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,620
produce and noticeable results so we're

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,650
gonna start with the the topic of

00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,440
releasing colab when is it available how

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,810
is it made available in the past we had

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,940
a community edition and an enterprise

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,560
edition and the community edition was

00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,230
released approximately every six months

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,700
and the Enterprise Edition would

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,550
eventually would usually then take one

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,790
of those or some point in time version

00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:31,040
of that and try and stabilize it there

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:36,110
was some flux in when things became

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:39,800
available and and how so we moved to a

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,750
very nice fabricator based system to

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,300
propel our development along and

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,400
organize it a lot more and that isn't

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,960
allowed us to actually sit down and go

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,900
how would

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,080
really want to release this in a more

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,090
reliable in a more predictable fashion

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,890
so we actually now have a release

00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,230
schedule which we've been working on

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,170
internally and the coop 16 release is

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,610
actually the first one that has

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,210
participated if you will in this release

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,190
schedule so this is what kolab the the

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,930
release kind of rhythm is going to look

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:16,000
like from here on in 44 colab so in

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,180
January you're going to get a new major

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,510
release of colab this January we

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,450
released collab 16 and that had

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,430
significant new technology previews and

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,250
that's when we will be putting in major

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,890
new version major new components major

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,840
new features introducing things that are

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,850
even still a little experimental but we

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,740
want our user base and our customers to

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,740
be able to actually play with it and

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,170
help us direct the future for those

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,070
items as well so for instance in January

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,740
we released with the IMAP proxy and

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:55,090
filter Guam and as well as a technical

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:57,340
preview of collaborative editing and so

00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,700
this version is comes out in January

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:04,750
every year and public access for

00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:10,960
everyone to participate in install use

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:12,730
it and feedback to us in march june ish

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,950
this will vary depending on the amount

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,580
of effort necessary but between january

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,860
and this point the entire team community

00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,470
will be working on bringing in you know

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,090
feedback bug reports etc so with the

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,530
coop 16 release in January we

00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,790
immediately have got you know people

00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,890
that said oh I installed it in this way

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,810
and I did this upgrade and this didn't

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,210
quite work as I expected and so bug

00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:36,280
reports came in this is fantastic they

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,950
were addressed and so we've been working

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,770
incrementally towards and the ability to

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:45,250
release a stability update so should be

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,060
a 16.1 or necessary at 16.2 this will

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,580
happen again every year these releases

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,610
will actually stamp them as this one is

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:57,250
now recommended for production use if

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,339
you go to docs Cole a Borg right now and

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,259
go to the deployment installation

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,749
documentation you'll see there what the

00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,829
recommended version is for production

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:08,709
deployments right now that's call of

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:11,889
enterprise 14 when we release the

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,660
16-point ones update then that will

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,180
probably update to recommend

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,999
reproduction is 16.1 this gives us the

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,850
ability to put on a major release not

00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:23,439
risk your data with a brand new release

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,329
but allow us to engage in a feedback

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,800
cycle to get to the point where we had

00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:29,259
in the past done with call of enterprise

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,529
and processes to something that we can

00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:34,240
put into production and then provide

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,600
that wonderful guarantee of five years

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,339
of extended support and is at this point

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,269
that commercial support for that version

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,569
begins as well throughout that entire

00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,860
time feature development and

00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:49,540
improvements in performance targeting

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,379
new hardware platforms new operating

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,600
systems will be continuously ongoing in

00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:57,790
september-october there'll be a feature

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,100
freeze and at which point we go okay

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,829
anything that is essentially there and

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,439
available right now we're going to work

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:09,490
on targeting that for the major release

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:11,110
in January and it loops back around so

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,329
anybody who wants to get anything in the

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,360
next major version of colab it needs to

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,920
be available and ready mm or at least in

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,290
in a state that you could say yeah we

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,089
can we can get this in good shape by

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,449
January we're going to make those

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:26,920
decisions in september-october and then

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,870
from this point forward we focus on

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,999
stability and performance of the new

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,490
features as well as existing ones we

00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:36,160
work on things such as integration

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,829
packaging upgrade paths etc so we just

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,370
focus on polishing so we can loop back

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:44,769
around to January and do it all over

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:53,769
again and this will create a nice rhythm

00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:55,809
that we that we can follow together so

00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,360
then we have platform support which goes

00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:01,600
a long hand in hand with this

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,929
development cycle and we'll see how in a

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,249
moment here very visually and one thing

00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:08,980
that we've tried to do is define a

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:12,069
little more explicitly what platforms we

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,900
are supporting at what level so this

00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:17,110
year we introduced Winterfell with

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,870
is a kind of a rolling release build

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,490
version of collab that anyone in the

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,100
community we use it as well of course

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,580
Michael of systems but anyone can take a

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,950
colab and target it to a given platform

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:33,520
by that's hardware or software operating

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,620
system but we want to make it very clear

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,720
what we're targeting what we're aiming

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,590
for just to bring some again

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:45,400
predictability and and clarity for users

00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,480
of Cola so we've settled on a tier two

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,530
support strategy and which actually maps

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,820
very closely it's actually not really

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,440
changing much what we've done we're just

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:57,190
actually being able to communicate it

00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,400
now so we've got the three tiers we've

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,930
got primary and this are platforms that

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,270
we say there'll be packages on release

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,339
day that's what we focus on in club

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,630
systems to make sure that there are good

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,120
high quality packages for those

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,680
platforms we have alternate platforms

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,270
and these are platforms that we

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,950
guarantee there will be availability for

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,920
so if you're on that platform you go ok

00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,180
I'm going to get a version of 16.1 with

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,790
commercial support available for my

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,250
platform but there'll be a time delay it

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,459
will lag behind the the primary

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,920
platforms and finally experimental and

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,140
this is the realm of the Winterfell and

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,760
whatnot and this there are no guarantees

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,800
they may be available they may be

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,160
dropped and this will be at the feedback

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,050
and participation of both you know

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,630
people inside and outside of Kolob

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:47,140
systems this is the community movement

00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:49,510
area and between these three tiers over

00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,010
time operating systems and hardware

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,170
platforms can move so something that is

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,120
X alternate today may become primary

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,510
tomorrow and this is completely going to

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,310
be done in response to the demand from

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,560
our user base what are people actually

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,570
using we want to be able to focus our

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,370
time and our efforts in our energy and

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,230
producing good quality results that

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,400
people are actually going to use versus

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,180
try and guess what people actually want

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:17,410
to use so we're going to start with

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,430
hardware and and normally we I don't

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,920
think I've talked very much about

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,470
hardware in the past with colab our

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,270
primary platform remains Intel x86 for

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,490
now because that's just where we where

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,679
we are but

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,179
and as geared mentioned earlier and as

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,150
you can still hear that high-pitched

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:37,809
whine in the background we have a new

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,790
alternate a platform that we're working

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,550
on polishing so that it will very soon

00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:45,490
actually end up in the primary target

00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,309
and that is power eight this is a very

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,540
exciting platform for us not only in

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,120
part because we get to work with the

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:55,330
likes of IBM and a lot of ISVs such as

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,950
oven at and etc but it is a really

00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,040
exciting hardware platform in terms of

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,570
openness which really meshes with our I

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,929
our ideals and our way of looking at the

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,200
world but it's also serious hardware for

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:13,450
serious deployment we're working with

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:17,010
one of the IBM is vs or be a partner

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,210
story avnet to define three different

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,550
profiles of power right hardware that

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,070
you'll be able to just order with colab

00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,630
already installed certified to run colab

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:29,230
so you can just say I need a colab box

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,120
or I need 10 Cola boxes put in the right

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,160
skew IBM will ship them to you

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,470
completely done you can slap them into

00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,580
your racks in a way you go so this is a

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,990
very exciting development for us and as

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,309
soon as we've got to the packages to

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,080
where we go yeah these are rock-solid

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,630
deployment ready this will be moving

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,160
from the alternate to the primary tier

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,309
and that really shows how that tiering

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,210
helps us communicate clearly when things

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:57,130
are ready and how things can move around

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:01,030
we still have experimental packages for

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,320
arm and you can install it we've done

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,530
this week I she download it before at

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,020
asda meeeeee but this is an experimental

00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:12,429
platform participation is more than

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:17,679
welcome great so on to the operating

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:21,990
system this server picture I find

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,190
remarkably it was the only non

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,510
encumbered image of a server I could

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,770
find with the white background and it's

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,040
like the ugliest thing ever it's

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:33,370
fantastic so the operating system side

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:36,760
we retain our primary focus on redhat

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,260
rell and and Santos in fact the power 8

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,100
box it's running right now is running

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,990
redhat enterprise

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,179
linux this is where we focus our efforts

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:49,870
on right now and it is not our only

00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:52,690
target however we have as alternative

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,630
typos and as alternate and operating

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,210
systems at that level and we have debian

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,059
ubuntu LTS so these are platforms that

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,480
we will be targeting again with that

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,650
time leg and then docker with Cooper net

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,850
days is another thing that we continue

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,860
to work on and continue to make progress

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,450
on and I put that in it in it's not

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,080
really an operating system I know but

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,480
it's a target platform and I expect one

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,970
or more of these to move from alternate

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,470
up to primary and then not so distant

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,450
future and again this is really going to

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:28,000
be driven by demand and usage we've got

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,159
a bunch of experimental operating

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,440
systems right now I love to see these

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,570
move up to the alternate tier and then

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,909
eventually maybe two primary and this

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,280
includes a operating systems such as

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:42,010
souza we've been work with clearos we're

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,330
working to bring colab 16 with

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,770
commercial support to you know vention

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,130
right now this enterprise 14 available

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:50,440
on it and and we're working on all of

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,590
these to move them up to the the

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,289
alternate tier but for now this is where

00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:00,340
they live so how does that actually work

00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:03,190
in in practice I'm going to show you a

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:07,390
so they can find the where's my mouse

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:13,240
there it is ah a spreadsheet let's take

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:17,440
a look at the spreadsheets yeah that's

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,700
better so this is a a provisional

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
especially but it gives you an idea of

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,590
how this this the release rhythm with

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,280
the platform targeting kind of works

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:30,760
hand-in-hand so as we have colab with

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,360
enterprise 14 and in primary recommended

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,330
production or for production and call of

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,220
16 comes out it is then stabilized it

00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,740
becomes the recommended version for

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,950
production and revised 14 goes into

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,260
long-term support for five years since

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:50,520
the point it was released 16 goes into

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:54,780
primary usage and then again in jan you

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:58,110
2017 will have 17 will have the the

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,700
stabilisation update of it etc so in

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,560
this version of the actually this is a

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,400
version of you playing with to see what

00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,830
it would look like to actually have

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,230
every second year Enterprise release

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,780
versus every year but then you can see

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:13,320
how this this filters down into the

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:16,530
platforms so Enterprise 14 is already

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,330
available on debian santos rel so we've

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,350
got all of our platforms covered there's

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,430
actually quite a few more down as we

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,100
scroll down but i won't bore you with

00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:26,040
every single platform when enterprise

00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,920
are when a club 16 it enters commercial

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,980
support then again it becomes

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:36,720
recommended we have the version of rail

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:40,920
that we focus on and over time so when

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,780
well come sorry when the enterprise or

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,220
when call up 17 comes out then it does

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,380
the same kind of dance for the pack just

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,630
become available call of 16 is available

00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,060
with long-term support etc and sent us

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:54,720
the same thing will notice that with

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:58,380
debian for instance as a secondary

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:03,810
platform oh that's like doing it in a

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:06,900
mirror and it's awkward so you can see

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:09,240
that there's an expected time delay

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,560
between delivery on our primary

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,570
platforms and our secondary platforms

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,970
this is simply a matter of prioritizing

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,960
our resources and making sure we can

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:23,580
deliver good experiences to people so

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,120
and you can also see where you know we

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,710
have whse at Debbie nine stretch you see

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,510
a little bit of red over here and I'm

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,190
not gonna try to the mouse dance again

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,690
you'll have to trust me on this one but

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:39,000
oh oh I can scroll with this apparently

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:41,430
but what happens is when as a secondary

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,170
platform when new versions of the

00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:48,090
operating system come out ere we go

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,610
while we will be providing support for

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,660
those who already already have say

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,580
collab 16 on debian 8 we will no longer

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,230
be supporting new installations on that

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,800
operating systems will be following more

00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,090
closely the upstream rhythm of the of

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,610
the base platform

00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,840
for our primary platforms we can

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,370
continue to support multiple versions

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,320
that's no problem and that's really

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,030
about that that again that allocation of

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,170
extra resources allocation of extra time

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,420
and care so as we nail this down this

00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,830
will actually be eventually shared with

00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,840
the world at large we're still

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,760
experimenting with some of the finer

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,030
details of it but this gives you an idea

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,250
what we're looking to achieve in our

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,800
hope with that is that as our users and

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,360
our community and our customers this

00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,010
then gives you the ability to plan more

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,790
effectively to go okay I know and this

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:41,040
is going to come i'm on debian i know

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,020
that when 17 comes out I'm gonna have to

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,910
yep so Q 2 will be the update to

00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,860
commercial support and then point Q 3

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,500
i'll get it right and so we feel that by

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,610
communicating these things clearly and

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,200
it'll just make it a lot easier for

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:56,390
people to plan and for something like

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,590
collaboration software and group we're

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,350
planning is absolutely key to making

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,140
sure that things continue to run and

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,430
work well okay now we get to the

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,970
exciting part that's all the boring

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:11,340
spreadsheets and details of how we move

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,960
from day to day but now we can take a

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,230
look at the new capabilities that we're

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,570
bringing to coal app currently and over

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,070
the next year or so this isn't

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,920
absolutely everything we have an

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:25,200
internal technology plan and i think is

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,810
around 70 something slides at the moment

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,400
so i'm not going to go through all 70

00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:34,710
things but these are kind of the

00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,450
highlights so the first really big thing

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,210
I think is we're going to be taking the

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,980
collaborative editing up to the next

00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,770
level we have the technology preview in

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,770
January this is well received we've

00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,290
partnered with Cola Bora to bring their

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,070
cloud suite which is LibreOffice on the

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:55,800
server to call out we're actually

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,930
working right now on the integration

00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,980
glue between the two and so if you've

00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,930
seen what we were able to do with

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,300
manticore it'll be very very similar

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:06,120
where you click a file in your files

00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,860
area you hit yo say edit it and you get

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,840
an editing session that you can then do

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,870
right in your browser I'm really excited

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,690
about this it's actually interestingly

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,450
enough one of the very nice reasons for

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,610
having

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,170
a platform like power8 around because

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,000
this is definitely going to for

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,890
companies that move to you know

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,960
self-hosting their own editing cloud if

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,090
you will this is definitely going to

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,040
increase the amount of horsepower and

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:32,470
server resources you're going to need

00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:37,420
and powerade is really well suited to

00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,310
this we also have a little bit of a

00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,190
revolution happening at the moment with

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,540
the clients for access to Kolob of

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,120
course with coal app you can use

00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:49,990
thunderbird or outlook or your mobile

00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:54,790
apps of your choice to access colab but

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:57,220
we also maintain to client applications

00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,410
so that you can experience colab as we

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,630
mean for you to do so with all the

00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:05,140
features and all the integration

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:08,110
currently that is roundcube one for the

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,110
web client and contact on the desktop

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,730
and while they served is very very well

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,410
over that time and we've been very happy

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:20,970
to work with both the up streams in both

00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:23,470
and be a major and in these two kc a

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,380
funder and sponsor of these projects and

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,720
have great experiences there we realized

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,580
that we need to move on and provide a

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,190
better experience on both so we've

00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,390
undertaken roundcube next while we still

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,500
continue of course to maintain roundcube

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,240
one and roundcube next is i will be

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,580
talking about that actually tomorrow yes

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,930
at 11 I believe it is about both the

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,980
clients won't go too much detail if you

00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,420
want to learn about what we're doing

00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,240
with these things it's very exciting

00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,290
come to tomorrow's presentation

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,200
Christian monocoque who's sitting in the

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,840
back there is the lead developer on cube

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,550
and you'll be presenting on that but in

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,780
a nutshell roundcube next is taking

00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,690
roundcube and all the things we love

00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:05,100
about it and streamlining it so it goes

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:07,000
from a largely server-side rendered

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,560
application with you know the typical

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,030
page p plus templates to a single page

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,730
html5 based application that runs in

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,100
your browser no refresh is not having to

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,780
reload the full HTML and everything

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,430
every single time just the data that's

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,880
necessary is going is going back and

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,590
forth it's using a targeting protocol

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,659
called J map which we're working on the

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,669
number of companies right now which is

00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:34,090
really creates a great example of open

00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:35,379
source software in action and we're

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,330
working on both the server and the

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,349
client side so a client-side JavaScript

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,349
library as well as server-side

00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:42,909
implementations and what j map does it

00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:46,989
takes I map it makes it friendly to the

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,789
web in a nutshell so roundcube next will

00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:50,229
give us a much nicer experience some it

00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:52,269
works on mobile a lot better something

00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:54,840
we can adapt to the needs of our

00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:57,639
customers and our users a lot easier

00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,799
cube on the other hand is our next

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:02,259
generation desktop client it will we

00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,299
hope as our intention to be able to

00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:07,779
replace the usage of contact for people

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:09,609
with with Cole out it has a strong focus

00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:11,889
as you'll find out tomorrow on user

00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:13,239
experience what is you know what are

00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:15,070
people actually trying to do and how can

00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:17,799
we get them there rather than cramming

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,529
every possible feature into it it also

00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,840
has a very strong emphasis on clean and

00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,099
elegant internal design one of the

00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,419
issues that we run into and our

00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:28,029
customers are run into an hour I mean

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:30,909
everyone who's used contact knows it's a

00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,889
very intricate Beast there's a lot of

00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,450
moving parts in it and one of those

00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:37,149
moving parts doesn't move just right

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,710
things can go not as expected and so

00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:40,570
we've really worked on simplifying that

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,879
stock with cube so again we'll have a

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,529
much nicer user experience with cube but

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:48,669
also something that is far more

00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:50,590
performant and more robust but again

00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,509
come tomorrow to see it you have to go

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:55,539
to see cuban action tomorrow live demo

00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:57,639
right yeah he's smiling he loves doing

00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:59,470
the live demos it's actually kind of

00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,729
interesting with this as well so while

00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,349
these aren't following that same rhythm

00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:04,330
that the server side is we talked about

00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:06,639
earlier and we're doing some very neat

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,470
things with with the clients so cube for

00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:10,869
instance is available as an installable

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,059
nightly you don't have to have anything

00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,529
else we've been using docker images

00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:16,889
we're starting to experiment now flat

00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:19,179
pack so you just go and grab the nightly

00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,489
one-click install see what we're doing

00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:27,129
see what the madnesses is what madness

00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:30,759
is afoot so moving back to the server a

00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:34,029
bit instant messaging is something that

00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:35,769
we're working on right now we asked

00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:38,260
ourselves so we knew we wanted to

00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:41,290
provide presence and instant messaging

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,300
and into our stock and in part is to

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,590
support the collaborative editing such

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,940
as cloud sweet so when you're editing

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,160
you want to build chat you want to be

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,950
able to send messages to each other

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,240
invitations and etc and so instant

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,300
messaging also can provide interestingly

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,520
enough a negotiation backbone for things

00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,580
like WebRTC which is where we're heading

00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,110
as well so we looked at it instant

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,790
messaging said well we have two

00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,210
different ways of doing it right one is

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,730
we can grab an off-the-shelf

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:13,510
tried-and-true jabber server each a

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,130
birdie or Mongoose I am for instance and

00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,440
run with that and we realize that they

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,790
would be slightly difficult to provide

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,620
the kind of integration that we wanted

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,120
across the board we want to use instant

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,730
messaging not as they not as an add-on

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:28,210
tacked to the side but as a core feature

00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:30,370
where it makes sense so we can easily

00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,720
integrate it everywhere we want set us

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,820
with collaborative editing I want to be

00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,500
able to edit with you chat with you on

00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,910
the side I want to be able to if you're

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,200
logged into roundcube I want to be able

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,910
to send you a message hey can we edit

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,440
this together I would love to be able do

00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,810
that right from my mail and all that

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,450
requires a real-time communication back

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:50,500
end so we're bringing instant messaging

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:52,720
and to colab currently our plan is to

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,670
leverage a very exciting project called

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,870
phoenix framework that comes with

00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:01,510
presence and chat built in and we're

00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,740
going to be providing a jabber api on

00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,480
top of that so you have a jabber client

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,520
you can talk with each other you can add

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,100
people to your roster but the server

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,530
itself won't be talking natively

00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,410
internally jabra this will allow us to

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:16,540
achieve far superior integration and

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,790
powerful features that we want without

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,240
being hemmed in by the issues with with

00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,100
Jabbar maybe a moderately controversial

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,110
decision but I think that if you look at

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,760
everyone else in the world and they've

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,890
either dropped instant messaging and

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,810
jabber altogether the people that were

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,370
using jabber and have either dropped it

00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,410
all together just said we don't do I am

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,120
anymore or they just walked away from

00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,950
jabber and there's really good reasons

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,190
for that and if you would like to chat

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,720
about the technical up here all day I'll

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,160
be actually outside with the barbecue

00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:50,179
and beer so great time to talk about

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:52,999
that from the management side

00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:56,360
we've been working up plans for a nice

00:33:52,999 --> 00:33:57,830
tool called pack and which is all in

00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,960
capital letters because it's a very nice

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,960
acronym but at the end of the day what

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,080
it is it's a management tool for colab

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,720
that will really step up our game and

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,419
we're working to unify the web admin

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,369
that you have if you're installing it

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:18,349
locally with the ISP asp focused hosted

00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:21,500
management stuff so we'll have one

00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:23,750
platform for all of that i will actually

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,609
give you if you're doing it hosted

00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,309
environment you need to hook it in to

00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:29,510
billing etc that will then be included

00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:31,280
as well so you actually have the

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,099
business side of it for hosting

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,710
providers and if you're simply doing a

00:34:34,099 --> 00:34:39,980
on site this is my installation you'll

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,419
get as well a rather nicer tool and

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,770
we're developing all of these things

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:43,970
that you why of all these things

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,770
together and that's a really important

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,579
thing to mention as well so we've got

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,889
two men with a camera in the back Giles

00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:54,589
yes who is recording the event as we

00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:57,950
speak and he's really helping us to

00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:59,720
bring a harmonious visual design and and

00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,119
he's been working with the developers to

00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,130
really discuss him and define what kind

00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:05,660
of workflows do we want to embody and

00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,020
that covers everything from now keeping

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:11,089
next to cube right through the pack to

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,119
me that's very exciting it's a huge step

00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:16,700
forward in design something else it's

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:19,520
maybe a little bit smaller but I thought

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,380
I'd included it's interesting on our

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,089
very near term target here we haven't

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,490
actually begun development of it but

00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:28,400
we've the ruinous been working quite a

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,230
bit on a proof-of-concept work and

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,119
trying to work up a definition of what

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,040
needs to be in there and then a central

00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,579
authentication service authentication

00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,710
and authorization services for colab and

00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:41,180
this will replace a couple of small

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,369
pieces within the guts of Colette but

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,290
most importantly you'll give us one

00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,210
place of authentication that isn't

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:50,059
welded directly to the backend

00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:52,819
implementation to say ldap giving some

00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:56,410
flexibility there opens a possibility

00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:58,819
for doing things such as third-party and

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,500
authentication which is really important

00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:02,599
for if you invite somebody for instance

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,269
to an editing session and you invite

00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,979
them from there

00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:06,959
you know heaven forbid their Google

00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,159
account they can actually then say yes I

00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,419
am actually the person you send it to

00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,119
buy authenticating through third-party

00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:14,609
allows us do things such as multi-factor

00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:16,319
authentication much more easily we have

00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,719
a proof of concept now for multi factor

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,789
auth with current colab and it really

00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,039
helped us understand what we could do

00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:25,949
with a centralized authentication

00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,409
service and when I when we say centrally

00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:30,359
mean in terms of API and entry point

00:36:28,409 --> 00:36:31,739
like with everything in call out this

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,989
will also be cluster bowl and

00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:39,689
distributed so that brings me to the end

00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:41,159
of the highlights anyways what we're

00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:43,109
doing with colab we have a number of the

00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,849
colab developers here and designers so

00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:46,349
please feel free to come up and ask us

00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,719
about the things I didn't talk about or

00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:52,409
chat more about the things I did talk

00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:56,039
about but before I hand off immediately

00:36:52,409 --> 00:37:17,549
are there any questions comments from

00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:18,779
the lovely audience so the question was

00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:20,159
just for the camera and for everyone

00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,809
else the question was what about the

00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,859
upgrade path from one version of Kolob

00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:28,019
to the next so this is part of why

00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,639
having the release rhythm is important

00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,349
it allows us to also know okay we have

00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:33,149
to you know these are the versions that

00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,559
are supported on which platforms so we

00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:37,159
need to make sure we have an upgrade

00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,079
path for our version X on platform why

00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:41,789
and therefore we know we need to deliver

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,119
so I think it's really good to look at

00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:46,259
the example of enterprise 14 to 16 mads

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,269
actually worked out the doctor I think

00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:50,130
you did the documentation for the yup

00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:51,449
grip yeah and so we really paid

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,729
attention to the upgrade path for

00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:56,039
instance there and the upgrade is

00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,959
extremely simple you install the new

00:37:56,039 --> 00:38:00,239
packages if it's a you know a small

00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:02,519
self-contained local installation you

00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,339
install the new packages there's a small

00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:07,649
documented on Doc Scola org which you

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,829
can get to from the fancy beautiful new

00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:12,289
collab org

00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,910
and there's the it's all documented the

00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:16,249
exact path you take you just copy and

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,799
paste the commands we really focused on

00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:21,259
making sure that data is I mean always

00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:22,789
backup right but we've really focused on

00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:25,489
making sure that your data is is

00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:27,499
absolutely sacred and functionality

00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:29,569
needs to continue on so it's it like

00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:32,630
it's zero disruption affair you have a

00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:34,400
larger installation where you've got it

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,109
spread across a cluster then of course

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,450
the process is a little bit different

00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:40,880
and in that you don't have just a single

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,259
set of images to update but it's not

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,569
that much different you update the

00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:46,880
services and probably rebalance your

00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:49,039
cluster off to you know left upgrade

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,289
right balance or the right upgrade left

00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,269
rebalance but again same thing it's

00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:54,349
really been designed and the

00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:56,029
documentation written to make sure

00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,799
that's a smooth experience and that's

00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:59,539
something that we really are committed

00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:01,369
to doing every commercially supported

00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:03,019
version going forward we want to make

00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:05,089
sure that at least between any two

00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:08,119
consecutive versions there is a safe

00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:10,190
reliable and documented way of moving

00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,440
from one version to the other and of

00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:16,339
course is a anyone who has commercial

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,799
support ah you can freely choose to

00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:21,380
upgrade when and if you want right you

00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:22,640
get to pick that at that rhythm and so

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,499
knowing when we release is also

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,940
important right so you can then plan ok

00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:30,619
well let's upgrade to you know 17 in

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,119
2017 will skip 2016 for now because

00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:37,999
we're happy with where we are whatever

00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:39,440
works for you so yep yeah just again

00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,719
just why this this end the release

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,180
engineering is so important helps define

00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:47,180
all of this for us right that's a very

00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:51,759
good question though any other queries

00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,759
in questions before I exit stage right

00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:55,849
good thank you very much for your your

00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,299
