openSUSE has a wonderful platform with OBS, and tools like software.opensuse.org and 1-Click installs make it very easy for users to get additional software on their machines.

This talk will discuss how this is quite often a very bad thing, leading to problems for users as well as extra work for maintainers in both the short and long term.
It will discuss the benefits of putting software packages in both of openSUSE's distributions (Leap & Tumbleweed) and propose concrete steps which users and responsible package maintainers can take to ensure everything is put together and working as smoothly as possible.

Finally, the session will accept the reality that putting absolutely everything in a distribution is infeasible and discuss possible criteria and guidelines for sensibly defined, maintainable additional repositories that avoid the issues raised earlier in the session.
