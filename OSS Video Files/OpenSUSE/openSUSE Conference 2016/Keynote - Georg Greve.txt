good afternoon everyone my tshirt is

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,950
lying I'm actually straight out of

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,630
Vienna right now we got in here like

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,550
half an hour ago or so because we had

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,710
our pull up taster event there yesterday

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:19,020
um so I'm still halfway on the road with

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,020
with the brain but it's all good we're

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,080
gonna be good I'm going to talk to you

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,250
about shaping the future through

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,520
collaboration because the primary role

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,920
of course that I feel today is as the

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,610
CEO of collapse systems a pure free

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,040
software enterprise in fact what we do I

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,840
hope all of you already know is colab

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,850
which you know there's all these

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,760
wonderful things from your email of

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,899
course I mean email keeps on dying yet

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,199
growing from year to year so I think

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,420
it's not going to go away anytime soon

00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,329
so we do the whole range of calendaring

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,400
tasks notes email contact sharing it

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,619
runs wonderfully on opensuse by the way

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,720
so Han starrett who was here a second

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,369
ago who just helped me set things up has

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,880
been working with the opens of the

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,530
community for years and so if you want

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,740
to install it on open so that's really

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,430
really easy but I'm not going to talk so

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,710
much about what Cole app is or what it

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,430
does in fact I think you can all find

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:36,020
that out for yourself what I want to

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:38,909
talk about more is actually the why um

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:43,079
why does it matter I mean what what is

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,630
driving us as a group as a company as a

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,369
team there's quite a few of us around

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,369
here since we're having the collapsed

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,560
summit again in parallel to the opensuse

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,530
conference we did that last year and in

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,270
The Hague together we all felt as a

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,710
great success because of the way in

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,960
which people could switch between

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,130
conferences and so you have quite a few

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,130
of the Canadians here

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:14,140
we at some point set together trying to

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:16,860
find out why it is that we do what we do

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,470
like what is it that drives us forward

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,470
as a team as a company as a solution

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,870
what are the important things for us to

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,340
get up in the morning and so we did what

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,400
everyone does right we did a little

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,050
retreat in the in the Bernese Alps so

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,050
that's an original picture from that

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,900
retreat in fact and we try to put our

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,030
heads together and strangely enough when

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,780
we wrote down you know what what matter

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,060
to us it very much came down to the same

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,640
principles and the word freedom ended up

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,330
on there multiple times so we condense

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:57,310
it a bit and for us the reason why we do

00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:00,040
what we do is that we want to provide

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,440
freedom and choice through technology it

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,080
is the culture of the company but also

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,600
the culture we want to inspire into

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,100
society and we want to deliver that

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,260
freedom through collaboration because

00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:14,680
for us collaboration the ability to work

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,580
together is actually what binds human

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,100
society together it is what really

00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:25,150
really drives this so this is basically

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:27,310
taken straight from the heart of what

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,700
free software means of what open source

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,610
is it's what our commute what drives our

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,830
community and in fact for us that is

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,170
exactly what we put at the heart of our

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,910
business and that's why we don't do any

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,459
open core we've never done any

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,090
proprietary we do straight free

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,130
software only have always done that now

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,820
the problem is that when you do this

00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:54,760
right when you do things that matter to

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,650
you sometimes you think people need to

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,760
get that straight away they need to

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,430
understand why it is that you do what

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,360
you do and why that matters and why

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,920
should also matter to them you think

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,050
that they should use it just because

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:17,110
it's open but just because it's free and

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,830
we have as a community had a long long

00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:23,020
history of trying to just say look

00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,280
course I mean it may be a little bit

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,250
worse but you should still use it

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,010
because you know it's open it gives you

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,950
freedom and that is true it is however

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:37,120
if we're fully honest with ourselves

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,980
very often not enough to grab the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,650
mainstream attention to grab a

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,310
sufficiently large number of people and

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:48,400
make them one to this I mean we need to

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,850
grab them somewhere else and so when we

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,760
started colab we actually thought about

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,140
what do we need to do to get this into

00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,420
the mainstream I mean we want to

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,700
actually make a change we can change

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:04,090
things in our community and that's

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,490
wonderful but that may not really reach

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,890
the six seven billion proverbial

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,620
mailboxes that your own keeps talking

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:15,070
about we want to have something that

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,210
actually drives a larger change so how

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,130
do we get there and for me I mean you

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,630
see that actually what we have like

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,520
proper design now you will see during

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,430
the colab summit we have you know really

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,290
um you know good ways of presenting

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,260
things now because we're trying to make

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,680
this appealing that comes from an

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:39,640
underlying deeper motive and the place

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,940
where I personally took inspiration from

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,669
as well and the team shares that feeling

00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,430
I mean I myself I called it that what I

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:55,000
usually call the that the Tesla moment

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:57,040
um the Tesla moment for me is I mean

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,130
besides Elon Musk been a very

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,960
interesting guy and so and so forth is

00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:06,190
defined by the fact that Tesla decided

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:10,060
to approach the subject of electrical

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:14,200
mobility in a completely new way before

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,900
Tesla virtually all electric cars were

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,490
pretty obviously built by people who

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:25,360
hate cars for people who hate cars they

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,950
were dinky toys puny in comparison you

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,470
can see they're still reflected

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,480
some of the electrical cars that big

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,850
automobile manufacturers built right

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:39,100
they look like a cheap copy of their

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:41,950
actual car Tesla turn that around they

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,080
said all right we want to actually make

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,700
people drive electric cars and enjoy

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,740
driving electric cars because that's

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,570
when they will buy them and that's when

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,960
we can actually get people to write

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,760
electric cars and only electric so they

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,550
said we're going to build the best car

00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,620
and it's also going to be fully electric

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,820
there's going to be no fuel option here

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:07,270
none so you do something that is better

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,040
that grabs people where they are by what

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:12,370
drives them what motivates them what

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,380
interests them and then you do it in the

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,470
right way you put the right substance

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,450
into it in order to actually be able to

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,710
drive a mainstream change and I think

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:26,290
Tesla has done that to a very large

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,470
extent with the automobile industry when

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,990
you see the amount of change that Tesla

00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:36,240
has affected into the automobile

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,490
industry in such a short period of time

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,690
that's quite amazing I mean now everyone

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,900
says of course you're going to do

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:45,910
electric cars and you know the of course

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,280
all the recent scandals also helped but

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,340
it was really Tesla that said this

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,860
change in motion in the way they

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,640
approach this they built cars that

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,350
people wanted like really wanted in fact

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,130
i know many fans in the free software

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,600
community of Tesla cars because there

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,280
are other interesting I mean yes they

00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,010
have some issues they're not perfect

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,510
sall good but the way that they decided

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:15,670
to approach it I think we can learn from

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:17,830
and it's funny because I mean Tesla does

00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,860
some things rather right I mean when

00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:25,540
they said all our patents are belong to

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,430
you you can use all our patents to build

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,370
your own electric cars there one thing

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:33,190
you can then no longer do is sue us for

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:38,349
patent infringement we get to use your

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:39,550
patents to effectively building a no-fly

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,029
zone for

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:46,300
it's which should sound familiar to

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:49,920
quite a few of you I hope because in

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:54,339
fact we as a community did that first

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:58,060
right that concept is actually the very

00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,940
same concept that the open invention

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,940
network has taken and now I'm absolutely

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,839
certain that along knew that and has

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,329
seen that before also because I mean you

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,260
see that his other very famous company

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:17,890
SpaceX is also a signatory to the oin

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:21,570
the point here is to create a no-fly

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:24,550
zone for patents in order to allow

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,670
networks of innovation to happen to

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,440
drive innovation in a broader sense

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,589
which is exactly what we do as a

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,660
community we drive innovation by working

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,490
together sometimes even with our

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,750
competitors in order to build better

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:42,430
technology that actually helps people

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,130
that build something that is better and

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:48,820
it's through that collaboration again

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:52,959
that we actually are able to achieve so

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:57,339
much more with a diverse community of

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,770
people that you know isn't yeah we have

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,570
yes we have a lot of people but when you

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,160
look at the actual number of developers

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,910
and the amount of change that they

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,730
affect we as the the free software

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,290
community are so much more efficient

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,230
than most proprietary companies I've

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,899
seen we generate so much more in

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,970
innovation it's quite astounding we

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:25,089
achieve a lot more with much fewer

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,890
resources so in fact even though Tesla

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:31,240
didn't exist at the time the company I

00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:35,620
mean obviously person did before but um

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:39,040
Linux to me is actually another example

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:43,209
of where we had something like a Tesla

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,959
moment you see Linux has bred much to

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,820
the dismay of of some people we know on

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,649
its technical merits to vary

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,279
substantially

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:57,899
show part it has also transported the

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,389
principles of open innovation of

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,559
collaboration of working together into

00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:06,629
areas that before we're really really

00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,929
close to them I mean if you ask which

00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,490
company is using Linux today the answers

00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:13,259
pretty much everyone right so there's

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,139
not a single one that doesn't have it

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,550
anywhere so this actually was even

00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:21,089
though we may not have known it at the

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,920
time another such moment so I believe we

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,189
can learn from this in the way we

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,429
approach what we want to do by seeking

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:33,749
out these moments by understanding that

00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:37,939
if we can combine the better with the

00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:41,189
right that we can actually bring about

00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:43,350
much faster change then we sometimes do

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:45,839
by only focusing on doing whatever we

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,189
think is right but neglecting to also

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,249
understand that we need to build

00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:56,100
something that's also better because the

00:11:53,249 --> 00:12:00,240
innovation that we have had I mean think

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:03,120
about the world as it would be without

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,230
free software right i mean most of the

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,259
internet and android hand is obviously

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:13,139
all of this has been brought about by

00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,860
this amazing big ecosystem innovation so

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:20,209
we must be thinking about groups of

00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:24,149
innovation ecosystems of innovation and

00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:25,019
when we look at the hardware side and

00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,029
that's the story that I personally

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,850
currently find rather interesting which

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:34,410
is why I thought it shared with you we

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:38,279
see that there we've had really dramatic

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:44,819
absence of that I mean we have arm still

00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:46,350
yes but most of the world right now most

00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:52,649
of the servers in the data centers in

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:54,460
particular run on Intel the vast

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,160
majority

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,350
so Intel is controlling this a ninja is

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,160
a very proprietary companies as most of

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:08,140
you know so Intel is controlling that

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,000
space to a very very large extent and

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,040
whenever is something is proprietary and

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,980
I'm not telling you anything new here

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,230
the question for us is can we actually

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,390
know what is going on in there I mean

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,290
anyone who's been in our community for

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,940
more than a short while will have seen

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,250
several of the conversations about what

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,420
is going on with a hardware platform on

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:36,490
which we stand in fact even though we

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:39,100
knew it a while ago recently we finally

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,980
got mainstream attention on that in the

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,680
sense that Intel actually has a cpu

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,970
within the CPU that talks over the

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:53,460
network it effectively layer minus two

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:55,990
in a way that we don't know right it

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,820
bypasses our operating systems that

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:02,290
bypasses all sorts of control measures

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:04,810
so and we can't really change that code

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,760
we don't know when it's compromised we

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:11,110
don't know what's going on in there and

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:17,980
that from a control perspective for all

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:19,630
of us is actually an issue now what I

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,420
find so interesting is that there is

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,150
actually other things going on in the

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,270
hardware field I mean if we if we were

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,840
thinking about what it is that we

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:34,690
actually would want right we would want

00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,920
an open architecture right we would want

00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,570
an architecture that we can all

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,170
understand where we know what's going on

00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:44,320
we want the chip design to be open we

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,210
would want to know what is in that ship

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,690
we would want to be able to build our

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,360
own ships we would want our own open

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,360
firmware and then we would want to run

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,160
actual free software on top of that

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,200
because we want a fully free stack

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,750
because a fully open and a fully free

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,620
stack is the only one that we can fully

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:10,430
trust because we can fully understand it

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,200
of course the problem is if we were to

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,920
start from scratch building something

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,840
like this today we'd have a problem

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,030
right I mean the level of investment

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,710
that you would need to build something

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,510
that on the hardware level would be able

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,250
to compete with data center hardware

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:30,860
that Intel provides that's rather

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,440
substantial I mean it's not very simple

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,930
I'd I it seems to be is that anyone

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,820
would actually ever do this because I

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,010
mean even inta didn't get here overnight

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,950
right i mean the intel architecture is

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:46,070
derived from ultimately you know

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,960
personally wasn't z80 assembler

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,540
programmer actually at some point in my

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,110
life very early on and when I then saw

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:57,290
the 386 after having spent some time on

00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:00,380
the 68 k boy was I disappointed because

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:04,940
it was essentially the z80 on steroids

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:09,110
and it kind of still is I mean they

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:13,460
cannot change to fundamentally so there

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:16,480
is another architecture obviously which

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,760
is the Power Architecture now power

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,330
coming from IBM also not necessarily the

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,010
company has always been extremely open I

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,860
mean you know a lot of the monopoly

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,780
abuse rules were written by them however

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,580
they've also reinvented themselves quite

00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,650
a few times recently and what they have

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,110
done and what has gotten a very little

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,110
attention and in fact most of people in

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,490
our community that I speak to about this

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,490
have never heard of this is that they

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,070
have put that technology into the open

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,350
power foundation which is an actual

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:54,490
membership open foundation where people

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:54,490
can join and can collaborate on building

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,260
machines chips their own designs working

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,960
together on the next generation of

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,990
hardware and in fact people do I mean

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,520
Google is involved in their rec space in

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,920
fact they've recently announced that

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,650
their next data center machine is going

00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,420
to be a power 9 machine they've put out

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,490
the design at the at the open Power

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,280
Summit and said here this is our next

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,080
design

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,980
the Chinese are now building their own

00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:25,140
open their own power CPUs and they

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,450
disable some parts that they don't trust

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,220
and the crypto side and others of this

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,430
we don't trust this this comes from IBM

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,750
we choose not to include these parts we

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,760
build our own CPUs now I think that is

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,530
really really fascinating actually it's

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,550
a really fascinating story and I think

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:47,010
it goes exactly in the right direction

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,330
because we what we now start seeing is

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,120
that people start building their own

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,580
boxes they start contributing to the

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,710
designs and they start working on this

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,080
and again open power then also has this

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:02,310
principle of non-aggression on the

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,160
patent side which gives us a very very

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,830
fascinating way in order to have data

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,410
center hardware that is actually really

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:15,690
really strong I mean when you look at

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:19,230
the performance of power vs intel power

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,090
is actually quite interesting it is very

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,020
good at heavy compute it is very very

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,980
good at parallel it is really extremely

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,730
powerful hardware and so we've we've

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,620
been working with IBM now on actually

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,340
supporting power as well officially I

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,840
know Zhu this it is fully on power so

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,550
it's red hat just for for the record but

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,100
ultimately the power platform has some

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,140
properties that are very very

00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,680
fascinating especially when you can

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,040
split your architecture up into many

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,020
parallel threads which is what Cole up

00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,210
does really well so for us it was very

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:10,980
easy to actually support that kind of

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:16,500
approach because in order to trust right

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:22,400
we know we want openness we want control

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:26,040
and we want the ability to build our own

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,880
that is the necessary prerequisite for

00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:34,140
us to actually be able to trust

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:38,580
with Intel that's going to be hard to

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,650
have there's arm and it has a lot of

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,600
very good use cases which is a lot

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:47,970
better and now there's also power which

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,799
is actually handled through a foundation

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:55,460
which I find is a very interesting model

00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:58,020
and in fact you will hear tomorrow that

00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,520
we've also joined the open power

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,070
foundation because we find this

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,380
interesting enough to get engaged

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,330
ourselves because I mean while it's not

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,510
perfect and the patent rules make

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,530
everyone cringe who's from our community

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,390
these are hardware people I think

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,530
differently about some things right the

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,559
hardware and software are not always

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,559
thinking the same way however it's a big

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,809
step in the right direction and I

00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,760
believe that as a community we should

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:28,350
really think about how to engage with

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:32,130
this because we need the things that we

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:34,049
can actually build upon so we're going

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:38,400
to be talking about that subject as well

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:41,610
at the colab summit in fact tomorrow I

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,039
believe dr. Maya from IBM who is the

00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,780
director of hardware research from

00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:47,970
burbling and we'll be talking about

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,049
power why what they're thinking about in

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,940
the new architectures I mean because

00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,549
everything is so small already right

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,070
making it smaller becomes no longer a

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,200
really an option so now we're thinking

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,510
nanotubes and all these fancy things who

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,960
has some things to talk about that and I

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,450
would like to invite all of you in fact

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,740
to come and have a look at this and get

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,840
an idea of what's going on on the

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,309
technical side there because it's really

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,350
quite fascinating you also have some

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,240
stats between power 8 power 9 and so on

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,940
and so forth so there's some interesting

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,880
stuff that he has to tell us on what's

00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,130
going on with the power thing and of

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,130
course we're going to be talking about

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:34,260
freedom in the cloud in particular given

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:37,530
that safe harbor is dead um privacy

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,870
shield is just about to die everyone

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,029
expected to to fall apart very soon now

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,259
and there is no really

00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:50,639
good answers so this is a time where for

00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:52,710
us as a community which has answers to

00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:55,469
the question of can I hostess myself

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,719
right do i do I have to buy this only

00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:59,849
from from one vendor in the US that's

00:21:57,719 --> 00:22:02,580
giving it to me as a cloud service or

00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:05,549
can I actually run this under my own

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,799
control of my own servers or on service

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:09,719
of a provider that I trust we have very

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,279
good answers to that in fact we are the

00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:15,899
ones who have the best answers right now

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:18,509
so we invited one of the lawyers from yo

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:20,820
pibe berlin which you might also know

00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,669
because it's the company where Tyga

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,039
works who's been the number one gpio

00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,330
enforcer in the world and one of his

00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,789
colleagues is going to come and join us

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,789
and talk about safe harbor privacy

00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:34,109
shield you know and where he sees that

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:37,739
going at the current state of affairs

00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:39,059
and of course as we've done yesterday in

00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:43,169

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:46,499
beer and meat so I hope you all also

fellow Canadians and sit with us drink

00:22:54,389 --> 00:23:00,389
with us and talk with us about how we

00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:04,979
can actually use the moment that exists

00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:08,399
right now to drive openness further down

00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:14,669
as well as further up the time for that

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:18,529
has never been better so let's do that

00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,529
