Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2016
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/778-opensuse-weblate-translation-tool

openSUSE has a new tool for translations support: Weblate. It should become a central point of all openSUSE translations in future.

In this talk you will become familiar with Weblate. Starting with translation and fixing errors in existing translations will be easy for you.

my name is stanislav carpets and i will

00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:19,860
i will talk to you about translations

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,169
translations are not complicated far

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,960
from the aspect of programming it is

00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:29,800
just it is just correct using of gas

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,070
text and those tools but it is

00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:37,329
complicated have from the aspect of the

00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:41,170
work phone because the programmer is not

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,270
the person would translate and many

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,050
translators are involved for many

00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,640
languages so to get the translations

00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,070
into the application we need away how to

00:00:51,640 --> 00:01:01,239
communicate with translators and with

00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:03,760
developers and interchange the data the

00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:08,290
old system which we have which we are

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,340
still using in to say it's this is a LLC

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:15,760
and based on svn this is just as we in a

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:19,840
repository miss a lot of the old files

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,740
and bo files with translations its

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,650
command line only so program so it is

00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:30,729
easy juste by programmers but not easy

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,330
to use by translators the translators

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:38,530
have to use svn which is programmer tool

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:42,360
and there is no integration with with

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:47,979
the system so programmers have to do

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:54,780
many steps by hand so it looks just just

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:59,409
now yes as you see the source code is

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,890
present on github and programmers have

00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:07,349
to regularly get a vot files and

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:12,459
manually upload it to lcn svn then

00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:14,910
translators will get p 0 files manually

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:18,330
again

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,670
the ventilators will test live there and

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,060
programmers again will p 0 file manually

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:31,110
up upload to osc together with github

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:34,390
changes so sometimes it doesn't run as

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:40,390
described and the path from github do I

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:42,910
always see it takes seven years yes just

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,620
for example when we met emigrated some

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:52,270
some packages and we found this fact so

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:55,560
we just need something different there

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,670
is there is a again a problem with lcn

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,480
the branches started sometimes in 200

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,550
2004 before an early when we when old

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,580
Suzy translations have been moved to

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,880
novella linux desktop and used by

00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,240
professional translators as a base then

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,500
the those professional work who has been

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:25,720
moved to le10 again with strings based

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:29,260
on the old souza then again to le11 and

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,200
SLE 12 and only few strings which you

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,440
have been you have been token from vice

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,990
versa the result is a great divergence

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:44,020
some projects as health of the strings

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:49,450
different in Hapuna Sosa and sld 12 so

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:53,140
if you if you check if you test the SLE

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:57,640
12 and if you just turn tamper with you

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,350
you are or reap you will see that the

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,350
translations are completely different

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:06,790
for the same package this is something

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:09,700
we don't want to to have because one

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:14,400
single project two translations two

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:20,410
terminologies and two translators and

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,169
work done twice so there is a new tool

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,730
called web light this is something

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,060
completely different it is a web page

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,950
East so anybody could start with

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,430
translations but still custom editors

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:40,820
are supported so some translators could

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,550
download it it in five favorite editor

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,300
and upload again it is integrated with

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:50,600
it and github so it can push directly to

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,510
eat and when when we are using github it

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,780
gives a notification from github changes

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,020
back to oblige so the strings in PLT

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:05,420
files will appear in a second in web

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:09,830
light and reverse reverse the changes in

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:15,290
translations will appear in not more

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:19,850
than ours back in github well and web

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:22,850
light has quality checks so many bad

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,970
translations could be fixed even before

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,960
we get a back report and the bride has

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:33,380
said IP I just new feature so we can

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,900
write batches or downloading uploading

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:41,030
in my epilation with it so how it should

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,510
look in future when web light will be

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,970
used for most projects web like will

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,240
communicate in true direct direction

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,720
with visible with a bright and packagers

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:58,610
has only to take a package from github

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:02,420
and enter and submit to oversee and

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:06,050
emily this way could be automated so any

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:10,010
change from github could result an

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,000
automatic submit to osc so in the best

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:16,490
case when web life translator will do

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,430
some translation in two hours we will

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:24,140
have it in github and in several again

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:29,090
several hours we will have it in

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:32,810
repositories well and the translation

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:36,140
model will look differently again the

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,969
temple which will be based continually

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,329
developed and to

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:43,129
in some moment we will branch it and

00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:48,379
create SLE translations leap

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:50,719
translations in case of a year sp2 it

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,860
will be only a few packages but we plan

00:06:50,719 --> 00:07:04,489
to base our translations on tumbleweed

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:08,239
for SLP 13 well now we have started the

00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:12,860
pilot pilot project this is a set of

00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:17,119
packages that are common for SLE and for

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,999
a leap and opensuse so we have we have

00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:22,509
to solve the problems with commercial

00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:25,909
translators and communication between

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:28,819
contracted translators and community so

00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:33,499
we decided to pick several packages to

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:36,349
test to test it there are two

00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:39,889
possibilities how the code has developed

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:44,959
one is one code base when the same code

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:50,419
is used for both opensuse tumbleweed and

00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:54,139
SLE so so the translation device is also

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:58,249
the same and the translators have to

00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,409
cooperate with community that took

00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:05,149
packages in this model lip zip and

00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:09,589
zipper and those packages will be based

00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:11,929
on web light translations and the second

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:15,079
model is the model with two branches

00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:18,319
when two branches exist in in the

00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:21,829
repository and two branches can be

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,009
translated separately but still web

00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:28,099
light is capable to copy changes from

00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,379
one branch to another branch this type

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:38,120
of package easiest slideshow which has a

00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:42,649
leap branch and the bridge for SLE well

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,519
just the web for further translation

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:50,080
server is easy as you can see you there

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:53,110
is a there is a tree where you see

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,470
project branch language and you can

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,430
translate there is a source in the

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,950
package that is a translation you can

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,320
you can you are entering there is a

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,330
similar languages translation we can

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,770
pick languages which you are interested

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:15,070
in and there you can see nearby messages

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:18,010
in the source suggestions in this case

00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:21,580
as a lemur ciabatta which is a tool

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:26,410
which attempts to unify the translations

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:28,780
between SLE and leap suggests the

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,360
translation that have been used in in

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,940
last version of us and some of the

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,450
translators should decide which is the

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:43,180
best one you can accept accept and edit

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:45,970
and delete such suggestion so if you

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,520
don't decide if you click translators

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,580
from the community they don't decide in

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,810
this week then contracted translator so

00:09:51,580 --> 00:10:00,850
we paid for decision of the final

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,650
translation then it is possible to

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,040
create a glossary for particular

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:10,420
language and here is a connection to the

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:19,030
source so you can you can buy you can

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:22,600
get source context by 11 click and there

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:25,150
is a lot of quality checks so many

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,180
translations which are not fully correct

00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:37,000
I get just before any commit and the

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:39,340
translators can fix them and and the

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,110
result which appears in gap giddyup

00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:48,070
github will be correct so there is a

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:55,540
example from 11 project that has very

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:58,350
many of of those checks well and this is

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,960
what you will never see in web light

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,750
this is a dress this is a model which is

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:09,540
used internally by

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:11,730
light for permissions here there are

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,620
they are set of permissions that can be

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:18,840
dedicated to do some users of groups and

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:23,480
administrator will check well decide

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:29,850
which permissions will be granted to to

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:32,700
particular users so just now the whole

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:37,680
open-source web light is open for

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:41,100
editing anything by any registered users

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,310
and unregistered users can make

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:50,270
suggestions of new changes it will

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,270
change in the future because sorry

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,570
because we plan some quality

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,600
improvements we will plan to create a

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,600
review teams paralanguage so some people

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,140
which are trusted and made in bastard

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,350
good translations will become review

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:14,970
every ever reviewers and any other

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:17,250
members of community which wants to

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,700
translate to the same language has to do

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:24,420
some suggestions and suggestions will be

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,790
reviewed and then only trusted users

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,740
will get permission to edit particularly

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,970
language when it is then this plant

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,250
advanced privileges support which will

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:41,480
help fine-tuning of privileges for

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,040
particular users so there could be

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,140
administrators for particular language

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,540
that have been privileges only to

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:54,510
manipulate with particular languages or

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:58,140
particular projects well then something

00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:02,280
we will we will need for for one hundred

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:06,230
percent review is support for work on

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,300
different branches then we will need to

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,980
we've only took one hundred percent a

00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,030
review for us that is done by contracted

00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,060
person contracted translators

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:23,050
community should be free to continue in

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,540
translation in Tambor eat so we will

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:29,410
need some implementation improvements to

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,470
support this and this is very related to

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,140
with support for freezes so we can make

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,590
fries of translations in summer movement

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,560
and send those translations to reviewers

00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,290
so reviewers will be sure that they are

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:49,330
reviewing exactly that with which is

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:52,810
planned for the release and the last

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:55,170
feature maybe not last but just now last

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,880
this is a pending review model when

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,820
translators will be able to translate

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,580
the strength will appear immediately in

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,940
the github and in the project but it

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,150
will be checked like like a string that

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,730
needs a review by trusted person so we

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:18,010
we will have better control over our

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:20,140
changes in the garden well this is a

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:24,930
this is everything for the presentation

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:32,770
and now we can look into the into the

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:35,230
package into the web itself the only

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:38,430
method we can we can use for a Guinness

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,620
just now integrated with opensuse

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,900
infrastructure so you're open source

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:49,930
elegant can be used in web light as well

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,920
then you have a dashboard where you can

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:58,000
subscribe to languages and projects you

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,110
are interested in but you can look at

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,870
our projects just this is a complete

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,980
list of packages that are no translated

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:11,740
in the web light you see that there are

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:17,020
some packages I mentioned for a pilot

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:21,670
project but some only only packages in

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:25,090
opensuse and we are already support

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,840
community by several projects like I ICL

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:31,590
I

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:38,640
or I see em which where our l10n is

00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:43,240
upstream for translations so we can look

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,950
how it looks that you see two branches

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:52,380
so you can pick branch ever you want to

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:52,380
translate open can pick your language

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:09,029
and now you are in and you can start it

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:15,710
translate just you can you can for

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:19,070
example only look at the checks only

00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:22,740
knowledge or name strings with checks

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,580
there are 99 such filing filing strings

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:31,170
in German translation for example here

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:33,540
you can see the problem that the

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:38,100
translation is the same it is probably

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:41,370
correct so you can you can hear decide

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:51,870
to delete such check and save and go to

00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:56,580
the next string so I think it is very

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:59,790
easy to to create two starts two

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,839
translations ever even if you don't

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:06,390
anything about p 0 files and p.o.d files

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:11,790
you if even if you don't nothing about

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:15,750
svn so you are welcome to start and

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,339
participate because translation of open

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,370
source I cannot be done without the

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:29,100
community because translators don't

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:40,320
speak your language very probably so do

00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:43,640
you have any questions are there any

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,770
plans to add some kind of screenshots or

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,370
possibilities to see the gooey of the

00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:53,360
program to verify okay is this

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:57,050
translation fitting in this context or

00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Wells Creek screenshots don't exist yet

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:03,059
thus that's such feature and very very

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,640
probably it will not happen because it

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,900
is not complicated i know it is very

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,770
very complicated you can only look

00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:15,700
at the source code this is this this is

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,960
a link to directly to the github I'm

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,050
thinking about possible feature just

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,230
just apply on fri but it would need many

00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:29,680
hacking so the host machine will

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,590
download any string from a blade like a

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:37,480
test like a test drive but it is just

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:50,460
about just an idea not no code is

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:53,680
written for it so I didn't mention the

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:58,120
address it is easy Alton and open SSL

00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:04,740
arc anybody can can the browser there

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,740
