The first openSUSE.Asia was awesome in Beijing, China, and this time we also made it great  in Taipei , Taiwan.
We designed some event made it different, and connected with local community to do more sharing and promotion for openSUSE.
Just like last year said , we would like to continue this event in the future, so we will take this opportunity to introduce 2nd summit what it different, and what did we miss.
This talk is quite flexible, we invite you to share your local openSUSE community, openSUSE events and openSUSE promotion in brainstorm. Or give your suggestion or advice about openSUSE promotion. Overall, anything about openSUSE promotion is welcome.
