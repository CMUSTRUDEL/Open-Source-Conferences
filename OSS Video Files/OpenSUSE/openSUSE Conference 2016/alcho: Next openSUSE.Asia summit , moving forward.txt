	https://media.ccc.de/v/846-next-opensuse-asia-summit-moving-forward

The first openSUSE.Asia was awesome in Beijing, China, and this time we also made it great  in Taipei , Taiwan.
We designed some event made it different, and connected with local community to do more sharing and promotion for openSUSE.
Just like last year said , we would like to continue this event in the future, so we will take this opportunity to introduce 2nd summit what it different, and what did we miss.
This talk is quite flexible, we invite you to share your local openSUSE community, openSUSE events and openSUSE promotion in brainstorm. Or give your suggestion or advice about openSUSE promotion. Overall, anything about openSUSE promotion is welcome.

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:29,840

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:39,650
I also to some and a nice and you can so

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:46,010
that we cut a very good balance between

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:56,310
any different topic and totally we got

00:02:46,010 --> 00:03:08,150
64 of 46 submission of topic and there

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:15,060
is except 226 then yep nothing special

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:18,480
and I once talking about some point

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:26,900
about this I just a meet the first one

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,900
is speakers and we we have totally cases

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:36,120
23 speakers and the front different

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:41,450
place and Asia people is yeah almost

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,910
eighteen percent and twenty percent from

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:54,900
Europe and thank you very much for lost

00:03:44,910 --> 00:04:02,660
speakers give us very good talk and we

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:08,340
have different event types and most is

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:12,799
short Hawks but their difficulty level

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:16,440
is not quite high so I think our most

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,400
community friends in Taiwan or other

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,009
countries

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:29,669
I came easier to join us and find sound

00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:34,110
fun and the second point is we have

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:38,810
local community co-hosts and the lettuce

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:46,080
gave us very good support because they

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:50,550
look co-op friend community layout have

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:58,410
very good talk about a lot of things

00:04:50,550 --> 00:05:01,979
like any IP things so and i also want

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:06,260
thanks and if you have chance to tie why

00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:12,590
maybe you can keep in touch with lynn

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:20,280
that is hard layer and the point trees

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:23,910
we have a lot of community in taiwan

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:28,770
givers help and you can solve that our

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:32,190
open society there is from China from

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:37,280
Japan and the Taiwan Indonesia layer is

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:42,030
very good support for us and is that I

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,000
must sink I must introduce sakana but I

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:48,780
think a lot of people know him already

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,710
but late time he is not in Taiwan so but

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:58,400
he still give us a lot of suppose or we

00:05:51,710 --> 00:06:02,659
really did a very good job but he did

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:10,139
very good supposed to us so things

00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:14,270
Sakana and ball other community song is

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:19,699

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:26,639
networking environment in our mu and

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:35,669
because we don't have good weather like

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:43,159

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:43,159

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:12,779
thank you them very much and okay let me

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:19,279
talk about something what is special for

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:28,580
us the first thing is we consider about

00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:32,200
a local people in Taiwan is most likely

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:36,940
attending workshop because I want learn

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:42,700
him and just not just grown and her they

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:45,520
want also to land by they self so we do

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:51,640
it this make a decide who have one day

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:59,890
workshop their invites people to join us

00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:04,600
and the room in the two limbs self yeah

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:10,860
then another special thing is we have a

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:20,920
very senior contributor in Taiwan then

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:25,120
we invite him to give him a special gift

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:31,450
because he still doing very good things

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:36,250
we've opened to say taiwan okay and also

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:41,980
we because we have one co-host study

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:46,690
area and the member of them is a very

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:52,210
famous Linney's education blog we call

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:57,670
him Weber and most people who learn of

00:09:52,210 --> 00:10:07,180
youth mentoring will know him so that is

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:12,640
what our points and okay one more we

00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:17,160
have we have very lucky we have a very

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:24,370
good designer volunteer to make a lot of

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:31,330
virtual things to us the old floss is

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:37,080
from one volunteer so that is why we got

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:37,080
the chance to access and

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:47,640
the another one is we try to co-hosts

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:56,150
release party with another digital

00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:59,250
ubuntu taiwan community and we do some

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:02,460
very funny things like we have a

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:06,150
lighting talk with from different sites

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,000
have different issue and the sound

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:14,370
sometimes they were this is discuss

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:21,110
about our difference so it's very very

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:24,150
funny and that is also good help us to

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,690
promoting our open society ostomy that

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:34,550
is before the late last night before

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:40,710
Open Sesame okay and I won't say some

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:45,300
hot difficult to us is the first one is

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:50,460
the how to embody local people attend

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:56,280
our event because in Taiwan we have more

00:11:50,460 --> 00:12:01,770
than 100 event one year is that 2012

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:06,600
layers more than 120 I guess in Taiwan

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:11,880
and every month we have big one big miss

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:15,810
Mullen it's almost more than thousand

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:20,400
people for our software technical or

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:26,310
open source every month so that is quite

00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:30,960
half of us to invite people to attending

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:35,370
our event and in the same day we also

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:43,410
have no there is another to a conference

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:47,920
in Taipei and all them more than to know

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:51,120
500 people there so it is quite hard to

00:12:47,920 --> 00:13:00,250
us to think about how to win votes

00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:08,639
people to come yeah and what we learn

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:13,839
this time and how we do nest for Taiwan

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:18,430
opens a community first is I think a lot

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:26,920
of local community who be volunteer to

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:32,339
help 2012's SME salute 2015 then I guess

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:35,490
they all do very well and delay old

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:39,420
learn the song skill to host a

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:45,269
conference and the co work because we

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:50,010
have a co-host so the chord with another

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:56,370
community is also important and that is

00:13:50,010 --> 00:14:02,040
they did a very good job the time and

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:11,110
the next is what's next for opensuse

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:17,050
taiwan community and now we are some we

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:22,709
meet a lot of friendly ssme and we try

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:27,040
to make a plan for our yearly plans is

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:33,329
with a shape or open steak or in the

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:36,490
alcohol so study area then maybe after

00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:41,170
one year's we can have a mini conference

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:53,079
