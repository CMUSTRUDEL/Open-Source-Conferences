Linux distributions like openSUSE ship binaries and because it is all free/open source software, users also can get the source code, but often it is not possible to verify that the shipped binary was really produced from this source (e.g. without added backdoors)
This talk intends to inform about the https://reproducible-builds.org/ initiative in general and openSUSE's progress in that direction in particular.
