	https://media.ccc.de/v/910-kde-neon

KDE Neon is a relatively new KDE project, providing an easy and elegant way for people to test the latest from KDE Git, or use the latest releases.

It is building binary packages but does not consider itself a distribution. 

We'll look at the motivation behind KDE Neon, the involved technologies and services, and it's place within the KDE community as well as the ecosystem at large.

so thank you to Martin Martin Katie's

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,790
most famous Quinn developer in fact the

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,650
lead Quinn developer

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,119
I should say this talk is going to be

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,180
about Katie nian so relatively new thing

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,779
who here already knows a bit about Katie

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:34,410
noun all right so fair number that's

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:36,210
good it's like microphone with a cable

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,239
it's like in the 80s next thing you know

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,739
I'm gonna hunting around the stage my

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,930
name is Harold sitter I am a KD

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,310
developer I work for a company called

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,730
blue systems and we do primarily Katie

00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:55,950
things blue systems invests very heavily

00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:04,229
in katy and one of the projects its

00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:07,590
sponsors is katie neon so what is an ian

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,500
man well nyan is a noble gas it is a

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,799
noble gas that is primarily known for

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,430
neon lights very lonely lights that are

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:23,340
created by sending energy through

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,560
ionized gas plasma but let's start at

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,500
the beginning what is katie so this is

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,670
katie these lovely people Katie's a

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,200
community if you have been around in the

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,229
Linux community for a while you might

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,380
area to know it as a bit of software

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,420
except it's not its community now and a

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,340
very good one at that look at oh that

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,570
lovely people in that picture there at

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,740
our annual conference academy last year

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,140
it was in Spain and this year's going to

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,299
be in Berlin so if you're around I think

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,400
it's in September if you are around

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,310
Berlin September you might want to come

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,710
too cute con which is the overarching

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,950
event where that is where that is being

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:16,019
held katie is a community whose vision

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:20,280
it is to bring the entire world freedom

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:22,969
and privacy in the digital life the

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,970
primary way we do this is free software

00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:28,660
obviously enough

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:32,050
and one key component of this software

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,850
is called plasma plasma is this lovely

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:39,690
thing here it is one of the main linux

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,980
desktop environments in if you will

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:47,400
everyone knows plans might presume who

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:51,610
doesn't know plasma lovely really but

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,710
come on pen up so that's plasma it's

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:58,209
it's really gorgeous look at the colors

00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:59,890
it's oh hmm but we always are doing

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,880
other software we're doing weird tennis

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:07,330
ball sort of things this is marble it's

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,760
our desktop globe I think we call it

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,760
it's basically a competitive product to

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,440
Googlers and it's using free map

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,780
material to render a free d globe of

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,730
whatever you want street maps for open

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:29,050
street maps or like this just random

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:31,239
relly you wave to do perhaps weird

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,840
things we create an army of potato

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:39,450
people using k2 billing which is a game

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,830
for toddlers I would like to say I think

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,150
occasionally you might end a developer

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,070
playing with it because why not so we've

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,080
got a widespread in software but we

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,790
always are doing non-software things one

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,060
of the primary areas where we do this is

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,450
a new project called wiki to learn and

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,090
it's basically a mediawiki platform that

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,989
enables students and teachers in

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,799
academia to share all sorts of materials

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,040
regarding teaching and learning and it's

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,070
basically a resource for free

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,510
information sharing if you will bloody

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,700
cat this huh so ok so now we know what

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:26,470
katie is we know it does software and

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,330
not software so what is it Neil same

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,260
thing again now that's confusing isn't

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:36,820
it so this is actually a picture of nyan

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,440
confusing enough as a picture of plasma

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,750
so maybe it's an Ian plasma I don't know

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,220
Wikipedia to say the following me on

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,660
plasma has the most intense light

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,460
discharge at normal voltages and

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,960
currents of all the noble gases meaning

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,220
it must be very bright which is what

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,430
nearness and that brings us to the meet

00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:04,910
neon is project that seeks to get Katie

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:09,020
software to the users in as quick a time

00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:13,520
frame as possible now Katie neon started

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,100
as a project the idea of it probably

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,530
happened last year in in in Los Angeles

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,270
where Jonathan riddle a colleague of

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:25,340
mine and I found ourselves wondering

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,030
where we want to go in life at the time

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,550
we were kubuntu developers you probably

00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:35,830
all heard of kubuntu it's an a bunt

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,180
aversion with carys software on top and

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,160
we found ourselves wondering well where

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,210
woman where do we want to go with all of

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,530
this where do we want to go with

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,510
software where do we want to see the

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:49,520
Linux desktop where do we want to see

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:53,410
Katie users get the best possible Carrie

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,290
experience and we found that the way we

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,310
we we did it in kubuntu was not

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,600
necessarily the best sort of approach

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,880
ubuntu is of course a distribution it is

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,010
a distribution that is part of an

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,890
ecosystem of many many many

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,070
distributions of many stakeholders that

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,960
all want the different things like the

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,870
ground camp once the thing the Kerry

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,330
camp once the thing and the X facecam

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,820
once the thing and you somehow have to

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,670
fit all of that under the same hat that

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,980
is your distribution and at that's

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,440
tricky and it's exhausting and it means

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,570
compromise it always means compromise

00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,220
there is no distribution I've ever

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,180
encountered whether didn't happen

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,640
compromise on some lab and we were

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,160
fairly disgruntled with that entire idea

00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,630
of having to care about other people's

00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,720
software if

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,460
or rather considering that we find

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,260
carries software to be vastly superior

00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,190
to all the other software out there

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,730
anyway barring a couple of exceptions

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:02,180
browsers so we came up with kitty neon

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,920
Kadeem ian is a Linux binary project

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,770
which doesn't really mean anything as

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,420
opposed it is based on stable

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,540
foundations which also doesn't mean

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,490
anything it is a rolling workspace

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,200
namely plasma which also doesn't mean

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,400
anything and it is focused on Katie

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:24,380
software which really means everything

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:27,200
in kitty neon this is essentially the

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,390
entire mission of kyrenia if we get this

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,200
right then it's going to be awesome and

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:37,330
the way we achieve this depends largely

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,250
on what is available at the time so we

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,530
kind for plasma in all in order for

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,840
plasma to work we need linux now there

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,360
is not one linux so we need a base

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,050
system that we can build plasma on top

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
and then on top of that we can provide

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,310
all the applications from the weird

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,200
tennis ball applications that are globes

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,690
to the army of potato people and we want

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,670
to do that and so those are our

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,690
requirements and that's what we came up

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:10,040
with so it took 12 1604 LTS which is a

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,290
long term support release which means

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,480
it's going to be released it's going to

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,740
be supported for the next two years

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,200
until the next version comes out

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,180
actually longer than that and on top of

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,400
that we stacked all the necessary bits

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,900
that we needed in order to provide the

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,110
best plasma experience now this is all

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,000
fairly limited to plasma basically the

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,710
only reason we even have this Abunda

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,380
basis because there is no one linux

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:40,039
which is a bit troublesome issue to

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,050
begin with but something we need to deal

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,510
with so we took that because it seemed

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,990
the best fit at the time if you have a

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,670
question as to why exactly we chose this

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,350
particular base and please ask your

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,310
question at the end because it's a

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,310
lengthy explanation

00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,440
k DNA on comes in two editions one is

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,230
the user edition yeah there is the

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:06,500
developer edition the develop addition

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,339
additionally has to sort of release

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,829
modes so let's start with a look at the

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,519
user addition the user edition is as the

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:19,610
name suggests very much targeting users

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,250
it is released software it is hopefully

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,010
very stable software it is software that

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,220
is built from the release novels so this

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,750
is probably the closest version of neon

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:36,800
you would find to a traditional Linux

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:39,550
system and its targeting the sort of

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,040
person who likes to have up to date

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,610
Katie software but not necessarily

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,079
broken one unlike the developer editions

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,970
where the stable version essentially is

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,250
the the stable incarnation of whatever

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,010
carrie software is but it's still a

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,100
built from essentially from get it is

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,740
the you know the daily build as it were

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,240
and the same for unstable except it's

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,860
from kids master so it's even more

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,450
horrendously broken the way we do this

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:18,640
is with a whole bunch of technology

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:22,910
probably ten years ago I started to to

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,890
stop doing packaging as we usually do it

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,230
by hand which are found incredibly

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,610
tedious and annoying so I automated

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,550
everything to the point where today neon

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,430
is being built in a fully automated

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,829
fashion it is continuously integrated

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,630
that's where the developer editions come

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,810
from and additionally we are also

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,480
continuously integrating or other out

00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:51,430
term izing the way we build tar balls

00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,649
into into the final binary packages so

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,589
ultimately I'm standing here and right

00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,660
this moment our our thing could build

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,579
some new plasma version and I wouldn't

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:05,990
even know about it in fact I don't even

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:07,670
care about it yeah ah it's it's not like

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,769
anyone would notice if they have a new

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,550
plasma

00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:15,790
stable and sexy already and all of that

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,860
is partially quality control is

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,689
partially quality control because

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,360
quality control is a bit of fricking

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:24,610
thing but eventually I would like to get

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:29,379
to the point where is fully fully

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,980
quality controlled what at the backbone

00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:35,619
of this is dan's Jenkins with a

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,170
horrendous amount of ruby code backing

00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:40,749
it up in essentially figuring out where

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,579
the tombos what other versions what do

00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,879
we even need to package when do we need

00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:47,799
to ship it and so on and so forth

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:51,339
additionally we have an enormous number

00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:55,149
of git repositories that are being

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:59,679
backed up by by some additional piping

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:02,410
technology and these git repositories

00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,749
are essentially versions that are semi

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,549
derived from debian and semi derived

00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,049
from kubuntu because we don't want to

00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:12,069
repeat work that someone else already

00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:14,850
did and at the same time we tightly

00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:18,399
curly collaborate with Debian to get

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,610
what we are doing back into their system

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:26,259
so we're trying to share a lot of work

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:30,939
on this department and the the third

00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:32,920
pillar so to speak of the the technology

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:35,379
that nyan is built on is aptly which is

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,569
essentially a very offensive repository

00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:42,579
written in the fanciest of languages

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:46,360
named go where's nyan going in the

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:49,329
future obviously containerisation is the

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,759
big topic of the day I'm actually proud

00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,579
to say that i do have working prototypes

00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,579
for snappy and i sort of know how to

00:12:54,579 --> 00:13:00,459
build a working prototype for app image

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:02,799
so barring complications i hope to have

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:06,009
some sort of containerization with good

00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,949
coverage by the end of summer of course

00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:12,459
more quality control open KOAT certainly

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:15,579
is very high up on the to-do as it

00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,589
really helps with getting the coverage

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,819
up right now we're basically doing unit

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,399
testing

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:24,189
a whole bunch of library testing in a

00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:28,779
include testing ABI testing that sort of

00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:31,089
thing but libraries are only half of the

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,009
software that we that we ship in fact it

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,139
is you know looking at the code

00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:37,959
distribution it's probably a minor

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,579
percentage of the software and we're

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,319
also looking to adopt a new installer

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:44,229
right now we are basically using the

00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:50,350
Ubuntu stock installer which is terrible

00:13:44,229 --> 00:13:54,309
just terrible oh yeah no one expected

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,799
that tunnel it to you okay ah we're done

00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,119
finally I expect you have a lot of

00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,220
questions I hope you have a lot of

00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:01,929
questions if you want to know more about

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,299
near you can go to New you're not Katie

00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:07,149
will talk or visit on on some social

00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:09,789
media finger metrics and you can find

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:16,720
the slide on the speaker deck let's go

00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:17,949
questions I'm going to come down to the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,069
front cuz I don't like sitting at the

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:23,769
back here um yeah I have lots of

00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,869
questions I have one really big one of

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:27,220
our guess I'll start with that one it

00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:32,079
needs a bit of preamble so I'll try and

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:35,159
be quick back in 2011 we started tumble

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,229
with the first time which was basically

00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,319
what you're doing here stable base

00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:42,809
rolling stuff apart and it started out

00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:49,089
pretty much like you've got right now

00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:53,709
good beginnings and then KDE needed more

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:55,209
and more and more and the list of pluses

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,059
that you have right now our stuff that

00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:00,789
you're effectively invalidating from the

00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,489
distribution the better that you don't

00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:04,629
want to be messing around with it gets

00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:08,799
longer and longer and longer and longer

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:12,100
in order to get plasma working how do

00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,019
you intend to fix that why without so I

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,269
just to finish the point without going

00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,789
oh it's fine where we base it on the

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,589
next version of a bundle because that's

00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:23,169
what we used to do basically we found

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,989
this was a transient mess that we

00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:28,779
couldn't avoid we either ended up doing

00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:30,310
way more distribution engineering which

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,370
is the bevy thing you don't want to do

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:36,010
yes or we ended up pissing off all of

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,980
our users with massive distribution very

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:43,270
basis of a new base all the time so

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,010
what's your plan to avoid that so I

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,870
think we have to differentiate what

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,790
distribution work is there is foundation

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,279
work which we are sort of okay with it's

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,020
not something we can avoid it might at

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,700
some point we will need a new master

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,790
stack and at that point we will have to

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,860
get in your meza but we don't want to

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,350
mess with gnome software if gnome

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,930
software or if you know software is

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,580
integral to the gnome workspace

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,560
experience if that breaks as part of

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,240
Neil then we don't care but that's

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,570
that's where we are setting ourselves

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,370
apart from distribution compromises that

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,650
you have to make the compromises you're

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,470
worried about very rarely come from no

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:23,350
they come from the new system d the new

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,790
master all that engineering stuff so so

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,900
then what's the point of neon if you're

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,610
still having to make those compromises

00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:31,570
and you're still having to make them on

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,720
a bun too why not use kubuntu oh yeah so

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,950
who burnt who has two things speak for

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,710
them to first of all the long-term

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,510
support release sort of thing which we

00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,460
generally agree with actually it's free

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,320
points secondly we already know the

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,500
things so it was like a natural choice

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,810
anyway but the most important bit then

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,650
that really was the selling point how I

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,240
pitched it to to my boss is we can open

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,190
to as a special thing where with every

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,550
new release they basically take the core

00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:03,010
foundations messer colonel I don't think

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,860
bluesy is in there but generally the

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,770
core pieces and they backport them into

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,660
their LTS release as secondary packages

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,329
so you have to explicitly go we want to

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,150
use this but you have the ability so we

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,829
don't necessarily have to roll the

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,410
entire stack up to the next version we

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,679
can just switch the foundations if the

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,449
need arises so that's that's essentially

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,800
the plan if it doesn't work out then we

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,950
will have to go with this very

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,740
unfortunate choice of having to go to an

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,600
next winter release which we kind of

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,429
want to avoid but if it happens it

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,470
happens why not just go fully Rowland

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:45,520
but why not just go for

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:47,289
fully rolling distribution trust me or

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,059
why not partner with a fully volume

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,130
distribution like a sir you know say I'm

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:54,340
trying to avoid I say one I did it

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,950
partner that there's two two problems

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,200
first of all as I was saying we didn't

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,380
want to mess about with software that we

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,309
don't care about you're gonna have to do

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,200
that anyway for the foundations yes not

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:11,559
for the other stuff but the other stuff

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,690
doesn't break plasma oh it doesn't buddy

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:18,940
fridge when was the last time known

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:26,950
broke plasma then why is it working in

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:29,049
tumbleweed so the latest gtk release

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,419
once again broke the theming which

00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:37,120
completely broke all doing integration

00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:39,309
of breeze into GT can do in plasma it's

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,409
not broken in opensuse because he opens

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:48,730
to the defs found a patch to breeze to

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:51,549
incorporate so yes in opensuse it's not

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,400
broken yes in KDE upstream is currently

00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:58,270
I've spinster broken because we released

00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,640
obviously before the GT key gtk release

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:07,570
and cannot fix it in the stable release

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:10,960
because it's a future release so so that

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,090
happens but beyond that you always Oh at

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,370
times you find yourselves that no

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:20,200
bluetooth the gnome bluetooth stack ones

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:22,630
blues free and the KD Bluetooth stack

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,000
ones blues for and this is actually a

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,470
case that occurred and you know boon to

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,970
the choice was we're going to patch the

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,010
hell out of the kitty Bluetooth stack

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,309
because in a boon to obviously the kds

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:36,070
step was rated lower and that obviously

00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:38,500
pissed me massively off but it also

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,330
broke the entire thing so and that's a

00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,760
compromise you know on a technical level

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,000
okay you have to make it work make it

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,799
work somehow and we would much rather go

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,390
well screw the grown thing and it's

00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,830
going to be entirely broken and everyone

00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:54,610
will know that it is broke

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,320
rather than you know spend time and

00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,210
effort on it there's nothing wrong with

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,159
spending time and effort on this it is

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,659
greatly appreciated but that's not what

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,419
we try to do with me and with neone we

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:07,240
very much try to focus on the kitty

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:16,360
aspect and and if other things break

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:19,000
they break but in this case don't you

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,799
just postpone the problem to the time

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,450
when you have to rebase on the next step

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,970
onto because they will have moved

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,549
forward again oh yeah sure at some point

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,340
you will have to go forward again yes

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,649
but it's easy to do that while moving

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,370
along then doing a toy every base after

00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:39,789
it's not because it's I mean I've been

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,559
doing this for ten years and I I haven't

00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,659
seen an ubuntu development cycle where

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:46,000
there was not like in the middle of it

00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,130
their landed in UX and everything blew

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,200
up or they landed in new chrome and it

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:54,549
wanted a new whatever thing and

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,679
everything blew up and yes but that's my

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:59,169
problem isn't so much that at some point

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,760
you have to upgrade my problem is not

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:02,380
with upgrading their foundations it's

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,389
your problems with the ubuntu

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,639
development cycle and that's what you've

00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:08,529
faced in the maids distribution it's

00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:10,570
it's how a distribution composes

00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,980
software no it's how a bun to computer

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,380
software because I agree with every

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:17,049
point you just made but it doesn't apply

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,039
to open susan as martins already pointed

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:24,519
out quite possibly it is only on a bunt

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,669
a problem but then why did he basically

00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,590
honorable to you wanted to asked have

00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:33,299
somebody offered i just did right ya

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:38,950
know I've so I've worked in kubuntu for

00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:41,289
ten years and we have made marginal

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,559
progress on getting policies to adapt we

00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:46,419
have made great strides at times when we

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,019
originally started Ubuntu didn't allow

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:52,179
for for any sort of feature update and

00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:54,149
in in katy you find rarely a release

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:56,799
that doesn't include features sager like

00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:58,389
so that policy was loosened and it was

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,010
loosened again recently but it's still

00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:01,570
not enough you still have at some point

00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,029
you have to release the thing and

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,249
everything sort of has to align and you

00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:10,179
to make a compromise on how many things

00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:11,799
can you actually get fixed properly and

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:14,619
properly polished within the time frame

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,379
and that that there is a general problem

00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:19,929
and it is a problem that I don't want to

00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:25,869
deal with as far as plasma is concerned

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:27,729
and to another degree what we would what

00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:30,669
is really important to us is getting

00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:32,169
Kitty's software to users so you're

00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:35,769
focusing very strongly on that on the

00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:37,749
plasma on ubuntu aspect but to me at

00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:40,029
least it is only a means to an end we

00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:42,309
sort of need a plasma to like test

00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:46,239
plasma and have like oh yeah here's a

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:49,629
plasma or have something to show the

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:51,609
reason I'm focusing on that is if I look

00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,950
at getting the KDE in the hands of the

00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:55,839
users perspective as an asst user guide

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,119
this is something we've been doing for

00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:01,479
seven years we've been putting the

00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:04,479
software of que te vea que de unstable

00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:08,529
via factory now Viacom buoyed by now

00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:11,139
Riley in the hands of users at the pace

00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:12,669
that you're just about reaching now with

00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,440
neon so that's why I don't want to

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,119
really get to talking about that because

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,349
from my perspective we've been there

00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,599
we've done that we've done it for seven

00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:22,809
years we have done it in kubuntu as well

00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,070
don't get me wrong with it was I am in

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,320
there but you still have the

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,659
distribution right and the distribution

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,369
doesn't include that software and that's

00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,129
sort of where the problem is in katy we

00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:35,619
were releasing at such a rapid pace

00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:38,409
plasma has been evolving over now almost

00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:41,109
seven iterations and distributions

00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:43,389
adopted maybe half of that no biggie

00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:44,739
have five six and now five knots in the

00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:49,059
released version you have to clearly

00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:51,630
have now we have them in li yeah so

00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:54,360
that's my point I applaud you I

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,310
I love yoga well yeah and so that's

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,620
that's it but I can't get my head around

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:02,520
with this but skipping to something else

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:05,010
a little bit I guess everything um but

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,020
the sort of the other side of the whole

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,880
story is actually uses expectations and

00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,650
the constant bit of feedback we are

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,010
getting and then this is actually for

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,810
both of you is you're forgetting the

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,670
users in this message despite your best

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,130
thing of you know we're giving them what

00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,020
they want we have one set of our users

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,580
and very clearly want everything great

00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,250
and fast and modern and we've developed

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,780
tumbleweed for that because we truly

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,370
believe that in order to deliver

00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,380
anything quickly have to deliver

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,360
everything quickly leave we try our best

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,310
to put Katie on top because we have no

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,460
choice the biggest bit of negative

00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:41,010
feedback we get from leap users is KDE

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:44,040
upstream is moving too damn quickly and

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,410
forgetting about us and that's you know

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,640
you have you do have two very different

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,160
sets of users you want to make your

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,320
software available to users but right

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,550
now KDE is forgetting about a huge

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,730
amount of people i shall i shall answer

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,620
this very quickly yes and i absolutely

00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,630
agree and I think martin also agrees

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,690
there is a disconnect between what katie

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,090
developers do and what users want and if

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:15,630
anything if if neone can do anything

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:18,000
good it is bridging that gap no by

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,370
putting the pain spot right on the on

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,260
the KD developers because ultimately

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,660
imma katie develop an ian is a katy

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,960
project you know if neon looks bad Katie

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:40,590
looks bad and all of the KD developers

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:43,490
should care stop yes I'm done goodbye a

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,490
lovely people

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,000
