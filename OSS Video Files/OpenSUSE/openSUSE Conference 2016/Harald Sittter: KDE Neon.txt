KDE Neon is a relatively new KDE project, providing an easy and elegant way for people to test the latest from KDE Git, or use the latest releases.

It is building binary packages but does not consider itself a distribution. 

We'll look at the motivation behind KDE Neon, the involved technologies and services, and it's place within the KDE community as well as the ecosystem at large.
