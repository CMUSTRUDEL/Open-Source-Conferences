Factory Staging Project is very important part of openSUSE Factory development model now, it's a gate to make sure new packages update/change will not break openSUSE Factory totally and we can safety to release newer openSUSE Tumbleweed snapshot. I'll introduce how to Factory Staging Project work in this talk, including the workflow, the tools behind of Staging Project and the client-side tool we are used to. This talk should give openSUSE developers a clear picture about how Staging Master(s) handling Staging Project.

hi I'm Marceline I'm from Susan but I

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,560
were talking about how the fittest

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:26,360
departure worse I currently I in the ice

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,430
thing already here that the talk of

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,590
founded rupee he's a talk has already

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,020
introduced a little bit about the

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,710
stadium Parcher & for free three stadium

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:43,310
project I in the lake guys the stadium

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:47,300
manager so how are we introduced the

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:52,130
city Padres the where is a long time ago

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:57,790
lisa is a history I this is the

00:00:52,130 --> 00:01:01,970
particular fertility former model so the

00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:05,720
developers amid the pic their changes to

00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:07,729
the factory from the departure but in

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,720
the past which has a merger those change

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:13,999
into the fate three but we stamp happen

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,880
where the Sun has the package of fails

00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:19,819
to POF emoji to a tree or a sudden see

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,929
that caused that other packages first to

00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:26,389
view and sometimes the package it up the

00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:29,509
pinery fighter from the package is an

00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:32,389
install a PO and sometimes the package

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:35,929
that doesn't work and if we have a

00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:38,240
bigger merge merge rimini sameera Krista

00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,039
into the fate three and we see the

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,139
popper into very hard to address the

00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:49,209
power and the debugging so we introduce

00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:52,219
the state important to check at the nose

00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:58,779
submit decreases safely too much too in

00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:58,779
too much into faith three so this is the

00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:10,940
effective my workflow now so it's the US

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:14,300
the papers to meet and submitted a

00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,130
change and you have a two-part automatic

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,870
and review and the manual review also we

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,019
have a

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,349
to interpret in the current testing by

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:30,010
open QA and then we added mochi eating

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:35,829
2083 so patchy at least three pass is a

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:39,489
part of the stadium pattern educating so

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:43,269
I have a tude in that user the review

00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:46,599
process faster so I to get a year if you

00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:48,489
create a year you could submit Krista

00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,950
and you have a two-part system

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:54,069
automatically review or the man who knew

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,680
field including the 50 auto the go all

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,200
day automatica tool and the porch area

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,709
either it was also the automatic atul

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:07,120
and manual review is a dump i double 15

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:10,540
and we probably yours so many crates i

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,319
have a to pass the security or digo my

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,530
new trick if you need yeah so we put a

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,940
loss a summary crystal into the stadium

00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,609
perjure then whip you will check out the

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,400
pills taters and we also generate a

00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:31,269
stage in nice though and we put the iso

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,329
into the open QA so it then we doing the

00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,639
some testing on the rope and QA then if

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:40,030
everything is a fun we merged those

00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:47,769
commissions in the last attempt Roger

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:50,650
into 33 so but educate the patriotic

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:54,849
chester he checks the son Patrick

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:57,180
approvals and additional refers the gato

00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:01,269
checking the lights of the scenes

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,370
riveting is a waiver fertility I don't

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,359
know how many people in this team

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:09,220
palette to in the human chain work a

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,980
reporter is doing a maltipoo automedia

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,889
check I were introduced later and either

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,590
also have a to pass the fairest agent if

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:19,720
you are practically that means you this

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:26,110
submission was passed by the state

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:28,910
departure so

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,260
currently you have used some either

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:35,870
change it to the fate three and that

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,050
dependence on the Rings I will introduce

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:44,290
in stata so if your packages in green

00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,640
you will go to a stage in perjure

00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,590
avoiding to confuse to you about it

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,440
because I were also introduced the 80s

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,650
stadium purchase so I will call this is

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,900
stadium project coweta reinstating

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:03,110
perjure just avoiding the confusing a

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:05,780
year if your package is done is not in

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:10,280
the Rings so you will go to the 80s day

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:13,910
temperature so currently in the 32

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,820
degrees we have a green deal ordering

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,100
one we to the windy road we we just

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,040
trying to keep it as simple as possible

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,090
those packages just for pushed Rick and

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,250
the Renoir interpreter and generate a

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,300
mini most activity and a dream to page

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:36,740
is a pretty much complete activity

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:42,680
compared to the fate three imaging the

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:46,220
lumber power is out outage I either it

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:52,010
was last week so I'm not so sure how has

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:54,320
the number this week okay it's a green

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:57,830
stadium project basically the inheritor

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,810
all packages phone rings and holding

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:05,150
caterpillar to wear repeal if we need

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:07,850
and we were staging and estrogen staging

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,550
it is a stopper project ID Nativity so

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:14,000
educated the piggery I coitus 31 and

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,720
then you have just a voi India campus so

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,970
31 pages rin dito packages process

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,520
they're doing one packages it's a it was

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:30,560
an airport

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:33,920
iphitus this PVC 64 re and SADC 64 he

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,320
was pure enabled in the first approach

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:43,610
activities only the ppc64 hurry and sats

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,740
64 pyn airport and educate the stadium

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,430
poacher where the base later at some

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,460
point for a temper with if for example

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,820
we merge the GCC seas and basically

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,130
knows this we made modular Jesus into

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:03,460
the factory basically each we're not

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:05,900
afraid at stay temperature but we have

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,090
at some point that we have a totally

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,880
baseless legend perjure then it will

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,030
compiler which reduces is this otherwise

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:20,060
he doesn't still using logistic fight so

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:24,020
he said it simple so the 80s temperature

00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,860
is the ability for language packages it

00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:32,120
just ensure the package you can build

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:36,580
against the factory SADC's 64 so it's a

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:42,200
very pure very pure project I'd check a

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:48,710
Piazza stays the de Portugal was not was

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:52,280
involved in the 80s staging as well or

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,350
the repo check our it gives later so yep

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,220
every in currently are confused why 30

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,880
patrika other ideas Lombardo either can

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,970
hinder that lead of the crystal is a

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,190
problem for a test agent country okay

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:10,250
ready for sugar are you educated chick

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,250
the purest either beauty style

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,520
fortification including the disturber

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,850
packaging and you check out the primary

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,090
fires is install a power in the triggers

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,250
the that come fries with the other

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:30,710
package and check out the sauce well

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:33,500
basically if you already some in a

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,669
change to faith three but you also did

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,980
another change in that if your approach

00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:43,190
they'll be porch area where details were

00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:46,160
detailing and they basically where these

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,360
are all your submissions you have a to

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,690
superseding the your submit request

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,380
assistance as well as have a destination

00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:01,990
in the developer J either also to test a

00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,990
new bill cycle compared to faith three

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,930
you know check is the forestry apetito

00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:12,080
to Krista as far as possible yeah just

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:17,180
as far as possible yeah it's a hyper

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,460
some pepper in there still also if the

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,980
river checker found any problem on your

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:28,010
summary Krista we were commenting on

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:31,340
your be Christian so the staged approach

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:35,480
were generated a DVD and import to the

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:38,690
open QA to instant QA testing our Easter

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,670
that details the you can just see the

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:46,400
tester educator it's by the patterns we

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,830
create a way of a test case fighter so

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,640
we have a putted for staging one waiver

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:57,500
basically it appears minimal s DVD that

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:03,700
you can so there's no Kanaan locating

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:12,320
packages in the statue one DVD so

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:15,080
there's the ptos so you can check it so

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,290
the open QA testing country the staging

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,770
tivity imports with helping here we

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,010
currently covers a lot more installation

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,930
in terrestrial Android a partition

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:32,240
intelligence corps bday of VN was an

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:35,840
airport and is a success to install on

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,150
the ufe environment put it into the risk

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,160
you assistance some comes out towards

00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:46,390
tester and the test tavern vitamin

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,650
testing we also have our stamped

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:53,250
our creatine tester for demo for the

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:56,470
older stay tuned to the current one or

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:58,360
from the liver 42 one and the two

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,470
current stage in which are making sure

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:07,360
that our core group does work and pretty

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:10,150
important since we we take a look lost

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,850
taster just tested stuff were in the

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:20,260
staging DVD so either will now install

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:23,830
any packages from the online report we

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:30,120
have a staging tool to process that

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:33,930
blows the some issues we fight mo either

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,790
like at the stage in distance how many

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:40,720
so many crystals painting and it's today

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:44,800
sir straighten the crystal to a stadium

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,160
perjure a laser moved the request out of

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Stadium Dodger and chicken staging

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,810
checkers checkers legislators of a

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,280
stadium project you will tell you maybe

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:59,590
there's the area near poverty acceptors

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:03,190
Stabler old recruiter in the indexed a

00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:06,880
temperature to the factory our freezer

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,540
Irie man Sinead either world replace the

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,840
packages in the stadium poacher the

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,080
stage idea it's hindering the decrease

00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,630
in the 80s temperature in the stage

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:28,870
repair combines the fish dinner pokin

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:32,140
the submissions so so if they lost a

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,750
summary crystal in the stadium perjure

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,810
is officially the fun house the

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,230
conditions of high-tech canisius is a

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,170
steady poem basically there's no pill

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,990
fairies in the 0 PS and in that stadium

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,210
project sorry and the old if you were a

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,490
step daddy systems something to Krista

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,179
and either also passed the open QA

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,879
testing and

00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:01,179
basically we have a to wait the current

00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:03,100
turbo is neisha is built and i moved to

00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:06,730
the open keywords so we can do in the

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,449
maister much wrong so basically if we

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,179
use the European the one study important

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,799
less tangible everything looks good but

00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:17,589
at the fête agrees the manager doesn't

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,179
match eed every day's the reason we are

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:24,610
waiting for the current nimisha is

00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:30,730
finished to view and a move tutor open

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:35,079
QA a waiver stadium dash for it is just

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:43,019
the information about the status of the

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:47,290
stadium Roger and I can see the

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:51,339
different color to represent the past in

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:53,230
heaven if we you see if you see your

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:56,199
packaging and install already Queen it

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,019
was there was means that we viewers all

00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:03,790
reviews including the reporter was a

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:08,439
step that is change you see there have a

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:12,939
still have a prong car and you can see

00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:16,029
this icon to you it's a pendant by which

00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:19,089
we do you feel in this case is a pennant

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:24,309
by decor review and you can see the

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:28,049
stage in see basically it's ready just

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:32,069
missing the review found that he go team

00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:37,600
if you're everything over fine then the

00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:41,879
the color were being queen that means

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,879

does not pasta and the Portugal four

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:41,380
long interior architecture countries now

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,870
completely support currently the de

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:53,610
Portugal is the only vegetable always

rule is if you are if your submission is

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:08,080
a love for the interior architecture for

00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:10,660
example power P is the only or the air

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,340
copy only you have a to make a short

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:18,190
list of architecture what is cooked you

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:22,810
cannot just a disabled it have a to his

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,700
core is to peel and you will make sure

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,830
the packages would be on the pacifica

00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,580
architecture for it important Papa CEO

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:34,150
Eric and they currently de Portugal just

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:38,830
leave this summation open and for human

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:42,550
review so in the end human have a 20

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:45,280
stabilities submitted Krista heavy to a

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:49,300
civil this review not by the report you

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:52,330
gave yourself yeah we also have up

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:55,570
uploaded by Portugal load the whole log

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,320
toot oh PS you can see that you are a

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:01,090
layer so if you want to understand how

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,060
to pop around here some requests that

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:06,940
you can if it the US Army creates a

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,040
pending pending review by the repo chica

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,970
you can check your local area then you

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,970
can see the reason

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,689
yes unless the people I seeking higher

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,959
layers samee layer Samira crystal was in

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:25,569
the 80s stay tuned and they already got

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,269
a stepped up by the 80s stay tuned but

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:31,990
even the merch into the faith we

00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:33,789
thoroughly educated the door is if you

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,159
are some issues in the real stadium

00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:38,860
project ever and that the Fate agrees

00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:41,769
major merge this stadium project no

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,429
submissions were just emerged to fatal

00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:49,090
territory by if we it was in the 80s

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:52,600
temperature it have a to wait until we

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,929
have a another institution perjure being

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:00,549
a steady po and fifty recent merger

00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:03,370
modulus do instead impartial and those

00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:06,100
submissions already passed in the idea

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:12,970
stating where budget into the factory to

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:15,850
Karen our country well we have still

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:19,269
trying to improve with something wrong

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:22,990
around the stadium perjure we were

00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:26,340
stunned to to this way temple we need a

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,129
better way to ensure the green Dido is

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:34,059
safe after the indeed o change was about

00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:36,100
for example it's very hard to detail if

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,860
we trying to move a package if from

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,039
bring one to do indeed Oh it'll probably

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,539
work for Constance but we cannot

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:50,409
detailer in the stadium poacher so we

00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:53,440
need a better way to to Turin and the

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:58,779
theater because the handling is also

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:02,590
hard topic yeah we are trying to walk in

00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:05,580
alley because sometimes we see their

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,830
lost a teacher chris the crystal of the

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:12,850
merger leader the crystal probably

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:16,870
causes some pages fails to view but in

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:20,110
the river chica it cannot dictate lost

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,190
situation very correctly so we have a to

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,190
improve it and

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,160
irie introduced a staging dish poppin

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:33,240
it's only show show you the ring staging

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:38,520
and part 4 80's stages we didn't have

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:41,730
any vegetable to work so a I it's a

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,560
completed a topic because I EDS stay

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,860
tuned basically is a dynamical create

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:50,280
soap opera you you have for the morning

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,560
hunters 80s stadium project or sometimes

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,000
your tongue to just thousands or even 10

00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:01,890
so you need to have a nice piece I for

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,010
this toshiba or otherwise who we maybe

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,800
we need another way in a lot of

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:12,030
potential but a Peyton official freeway

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:16,320
later the letter developer understanding

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:18,960
