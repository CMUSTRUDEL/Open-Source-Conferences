YaST has been trying to find a solution to work with configuration files in a way that is easy and reusable, while ensuring the consistency of the resulting configuration. The response is Config Files API (CFA), a generic framework to work with configuration files in Ruby. Although currently is only used in the yast2-bootloader module, CFA will become one of the key components of YaST in the near future. Its design and foundation look beyond YaST, making it a useful resource in any environment needing programatic and semantic management of configuration files.  The talk will provide an overall overview of CFA's architecture and down to earth examples on how CFA can be used and extended.
