Booting is hard. Booting in the ARM world is even harder. State of the art are a dozen different boot loaders that may or may not deserve that name. Each gets configured differently and each has its own pros and cons.

As a distribution this is a nightmare. Configuring each and every one of them complicates code that really should be very simple.

To solve the problem, we can just add another layer of abstraction (grub2) on top of another layer of abstraction (uEFI) on top of another layer of abstraction (u-boot). Follow me on a journey on how all those layers can make life easier for the distribution and how much fun uEFI really is.

After this talk, you will know how ARM systems boot, what uEFI really means, how uEFI binaries interact with firmware and how we are going to move to uEFI based boot on openSUSE for ARM.
