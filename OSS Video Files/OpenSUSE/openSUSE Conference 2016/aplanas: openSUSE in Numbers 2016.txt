During 2013 we provided some data about numbers of users and downloads of openSUSE. Now in 2016 we have a different scenario: Tumbleweed is the a new kind of rolling distribution that base the quality on automatic tests (openQA) and a better development process. Leap is also a new kind of stable distribution, a chimeric approach that mix the head of a enterprise product (SLE) and the heard of Factory.

Those changes are so deep that 2016 deserve an update of the analysis done in 2013 about openSUSE users and downloads!
