00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:55,750
you know sensational so wait a minute

00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:02,939
only because we all believe for

00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:07,379
committee in the summit s to see Scott

participants under submit and we set the

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:29,680
ratio of one volunteers for 10 people so

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:35,299
we have much positive resentful did and

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:40,599
us sponsorship or anything

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:48,040
finding vendors and not fantastic for

Avengers oranges even Superman and

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:56,110
because we have a lot of equality you

00:03:51,799 --> 00:04:07,280
can attack and we want to attract people

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:12,489
and our contribution to project what

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:16,750
they actually volunteerism participants

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,750

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:42,659
we are targeting for the students we

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,659
have SD s a professional

00:05:50,009 --> 00:06:00,030
the difference between participants and

00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:07,710
volunteers because the equation is huge

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,710
so participants have to pay for 50,000

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:24,009
rupees for this price for students and

00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:29,340
what happens in person rupiah one person

00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:35,550
he and nine dollars this crisis for

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,550
professional it is nice

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:57,660
participants did not get so can so they

00:06:49,599 --> 00:07:02,430

and they have a chance to expanded okay

00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:14,840
