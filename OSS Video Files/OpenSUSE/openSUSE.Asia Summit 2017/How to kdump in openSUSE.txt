	00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,609
[Music]

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,589
[Music]

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,820
[Music]

00:00:39,829 --> 00:01:10,110
running memories so other guys in its

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:24,110
this kind of anomaly because there is a

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:29,720
lower level if we want to even make this

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:33,020
similar because there is no lower

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,020
program lower

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,989
[Music]

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:59,550
so there's more than one way to do that

00:01:44,290 --> 00:02:07,830
work in companies is so phenomenal Steve

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:07,830
Liesman memories of the Pennington and

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:19,660
internal states at the moment with as

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:22,030
little as even touch the state of the

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,530
memory that means the late leave the

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:31,080
memory estate in the city consistent and

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,080
after we talk about the weekend

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:54,580
all the cost so the content in the

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:57,040
private so how to the idea it depends a

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,980
design quality for no way out

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:09,940
as I mentioned before that there's a

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:17,590
little-known lower level so submitting

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:23,250
that to reserve some memory for a second

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:26,910
for a second for then

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:32,040
little crush having the second journal

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:36,830
people control of the shooter and save

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:48,630
the memory other memories used by

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:52,350
assistance based on either so before we

00:03:48,630 --> 00:04:07,250
go on out there is something to make

00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:07,250
clear when you go there is some name so

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:28,650
also have names I have to know

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:33,620
personally I like the name Hannibal I

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:37,260
mean electric fire of an adrenaline and

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:42,440
because the name is describe what what

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,440
happened what what kind of beautiful

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:55,020
next how true because it on niether

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:58,530
and the price level contest so almost

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,080
the execution this function is not

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,390
enabled by default

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,750
normally you need to manually enable and

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,710
out there are two paths things you need

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:15,710
to do first

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:20,690
first to reload a non-vegan and second

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:24,260
before crash very happy you need to load

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,260
second column and

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,669
Wangari and how to play later

00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:42,599
so how the child Colonel to reserve

00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:44,550
memory I see mr. Postol absolute lie

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:51,369
Samoan drop

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:54,119
and his name is crusher on the slide

00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:59,349
showed that the most effectively used

00:05:54,119 --> 00:06:05,319
bombs and example the second vice was

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:11,229
that without 200 and the 56 atabaque

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:16,269
memory for second and the sixth to 60

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:17,379
and in in the third line means that it

00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:21,099
is first

00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:24,519
it also specified at the start the start

00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:33,149
address of the leader but normally nor

00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:37,229
days you did not use that open and

00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:44,919
second sees at the side you need to know

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:45,879
and any tardy so I'll do that here's the

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,399
program called

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:56,489
exp so we can use the second line it's a

00:06:51,399 --> 00:07:01,119
type war line to load second colonel and

00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:05,469
a time we guarantee to repeal the memory

00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:08,259
region and there is another things the

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:14,610
line to the second Colonel unity for the

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:19,780
problem so you can also specify the line

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:24,750
to a colonel base with txt

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:29,920
so now we can call this ard a new name

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:33,370
Kodama generic or player after all these

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,950
there is them a way to check whether the

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,910
longing to distress you successful you

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,830
can't can well you're from this fire

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,130
please colonel yes the correct loaded

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,990
into content is what that means it

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:52,900
loaded their omens

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:58,870
I love it so let's talk more about PFC

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:02,890
so what it is it is the essential

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,520
mechanism supporting it down if there is

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,200
obviously

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,220
oh there's inverted not easy to even

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:15,460
pick up so the most punctual for

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:19,030
obviously is to put aside the colonel

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:22,990
from Fort Renault community we know that

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:27,130
if you want to change one normally that

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:35,710
means we're putting a system so meaning

00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:42,339
that started on the season so for some

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:44,470
system family some slower the balancing

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:50,230
visualization cost of all the time

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:58,420
so he can see can bypass valve so I'm

00:08:50,230 --> 00:09:03,220
saving yeah for too long second colonel

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:06,190
Oh actually very too hard to envision

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,570
dysfunction and they thanked me and I

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,589
mentioned that there's Euler Christmas

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:18,780
KFC and has been directly and the

00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:22,839
responding for know Cisco PSD file only

00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,550
this there is another system to score

00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,270
Martinez me Lord

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:33,360
the that name is

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:36,990
misty but this case the foul is that you

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:42,570
and your work just call the benefit is

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:45,240
that you can load a file before that it

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,360
had told only memory what is a gravity

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,840
the haul-back

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:59,220
yes we can we can do some checks on

00:09:50,840 --> 00:10:07,590
three so I'll do it on publishes first

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:11,600
came into new story but W you know that

00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:17,610
yes they need one of them anything else

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:27,980
okay so he very good to historian to be

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:27,980
bound together and we normally use it

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:46,920
yeah this is the if you use the last

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:52,230
console which visitors what this option

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:56,870
is reflection you down disable it on so

00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:04,770
we can use the keyboard unity to check

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:08,740
and the next like to talk to bottom part

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:12,550
so that you can choose how many

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:18,510
but normally yes have you that you don't

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:22,270
need to do something anything about and

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:27,070
obviously I believe you may have no

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:30,310
vision the system this field has no know

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,820
something he dominated because there's

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,040
no number written his own number we

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:40,300
didn't know the family hadn't during

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:48,430
this starting of the initialization

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:53,290
state of a so other ribbon like let

00:11:48,430 --> 00:12:02,470
let's check meaning you can see that

00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:05,140
there's more income line is it is a

00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:10,470
little different than what I mentioned

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,470
about the hilum that too

00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:33,760
and cancer whether they slowly yes now I

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:39,420
will show but before that there seemed

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:48,840
to make it because without rush heaven

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:52,930
no heaven but hoping to trigger Christ

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:58,150
that's provided we just the angle

00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:06,580
character to this fire but normally but

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:08,980
normally in the contents also physically

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,040
dismiss contain able I mean then you

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,070
have touched the icons detune about to

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,920
price but it's crushing is not about

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,670
without

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,249
function these users who have come to

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,569
life life get up

00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:31,279
so now I will show I think actually in

00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:35,239
other real-time it is my I might do I do

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,650
a recording so I will show us win

00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:39,830
elections

00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,830
[Music]

00:14:04,030 --> 00:15:00,700
I know this way is not that the father

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:06,610
default behavior developed with a worry

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:12,820
just a reboot I mean I for the tenon I

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:17,470
mean neighborhood function you can see

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:22,170
this line this line is the professor I

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,170
mean Tom Bell is cold

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:46,050
yeah

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:57,030
hearing the rock another pop rock sugar

00:15:46,050 --> 00:16:00,240
tonight ever see the first volume of the

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:05,430
messenger so data the time when the

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:11,100
Mexico Canada you see that this before

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:15,030
this line is 101 and after that this 0 I

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:19,110
mean that mean were starting with this

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:22,070
this start this line at pykon internal

00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,070
control system

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,659
and although you can check their arms

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:48,249
pasta I mean the line hello

00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:51,179
here apart there's no price because to

00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,179
be merciful

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:18,790
so what happened after second it's like

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:21,520
the process like I don't know but they

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:30,010
show you that this in some special my

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:33,490
heart and real work is finished in the

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:40,450
example even Hardy anything that you

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:45,250
know space only there so let's on mobile

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:49,510
obviously and fell from about Harry

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:55,900
provided minimal industries which side

00:17:49,510 --> 00:18:00,190
so to back up some baseball every and a

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:04,420
most important one of these are his big

00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:17,290
comeback autonomy compel weakness well

00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:19,420
be straight and fell from this we so

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:28,290
before it happened because well let's

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:51,130
talk more about where we go exposed

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:57,000
memory it is it is but oh we need to not

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:57,000
only you even got you the city I to say

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:04,530
but right because because including the

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,530
home

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:15,000
which many included some part that is

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:19,790
not that useful so practically if you

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,020
say the whole memory even not another

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:31,250
real happy done with anything exactly to

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:36,510
be so this is what we need not back

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:39,240
because obviously porous oversold and up

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:42,480
our futures and winnings meaningless

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,200
duties to make them coming more

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,280
meaningful what is real

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:55,050
for example British and zero peace and

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:58,650
unity speed and force in progress in

00:19:55,050 --> 00:20:05,340
compel and also compress the data to

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:11,250
make the about more small smaller so

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:18,420
it's a tiny book and for for how to

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:28,620
either are useless page also polygon

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:32,820
black there are 32 level of and to

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,820
rewrite the topmost is the quality of

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,830
the sushi I mean that make a small

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:45,750
Easter come back and let's see means

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:50,120
comprises even also science at the

00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,120
servants were yeah

00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:02,830
in the worst way yes I decided including

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:15,690
Tommy so that we have to follow this

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:21,309
image are so there another part in to me

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:24,340
as where is waxing comeback actually

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:29,919
lose these about a lot of luggage to

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:39,360
stay well the most important but if you

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:45,270
are someone running on what then example

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:49,630
you also and change the target there's a

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:56,370
list of different habits permissible you

00:21:49,630 --> 00:22:01,570
can sit compel to example is directly

00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:04,539
are viruses were forced over then you

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:16,620
can implement the function for example

00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:20,409
you have machines and Thomas coercion

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:29,110
that you can gather on the file from the

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:33,929
soul so actually you can change all the

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:36,929
settings in the fire you guys see that

00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,929
yeah

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:51,680
we have this automatically settings

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:54,700
there are archaeologists money's kingdom

00:22:51,680 --> 00:23:00,980
earlier service and the other is

00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:05,720
included so you know that Mohammed is

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:08,930
used to gather to ever happen so this

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:14,510
thing is this thing should be do as

00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:20,120
earlier and postal so what that that is

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:22,460
what that one meaning here phenology to

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,800
search the medicines time very service

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:36,890
is low second to none and secondary to

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:40,010
memory but the other sometimes we often

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:43,370
you update a neutral Oh change the Kanto

00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:47,660
region optional well you need to update

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:50,480
it become learning together so this is

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,710
why they're there is another so much

00:23:50,480 --> 00:24:00,910
conflict and web service give us the

00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:00,910
nominee service include miss Vale for

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:11,510
soap it on service also did another is

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:18,950
having recalibrate he appeared on many

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:22,670
re and both of the service are suitable

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,580
service the type of an update of the his

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:30,890
to service our welcome I mean that you

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:32,770
don't need car one time after the during

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:40,280
the movie

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:42,440
there will be some movement maybe maybe

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:48,800
we have we will have our new merciless

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:52,730
to the future this is another issues -

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,270
certainly in real case that is the size

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:58,550
relation normally a dimension data just

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:05,360
to have you to automatically emulate

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:10,100
this site and yes there's a comment back

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:15,080
a unit side that the whole web page to

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:18,860
save it means own piece so you can

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:23,140
normally even get to sign before if you

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:26,420
are no one's that side of the infirmary

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:32,380
when I use this to travel to celebrate

00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:32,380
together site but for some systems have

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,439
[Music]

00:25:46,090 --> 00:26:04,360
only one meaning to analysis but the

00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:07,310
other virtually no truth Jimmy and

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:15,190
visually the knowledge is called first

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:18,150
person portrayed ug like the TD be

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,809
wasted - and

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,340
[Music]

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:27,629
so there's no fountains Christ but this

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:36,070
new program is still under development

00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:40,830
but the new a good woman so if you have

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,830

00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,630
