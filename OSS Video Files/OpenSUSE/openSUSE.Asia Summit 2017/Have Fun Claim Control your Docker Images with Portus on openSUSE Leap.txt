00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:17,450
expensively but I will explain our

00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:23,360
mystery project from colorful focus what

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:34,400
is this function itself and I will

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:36,970

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,620
if my test

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:44,650

00:01:44,650 --> 00:02:16,380
mean if you have any question but if you

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:46,550
[Music]

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,479
[Music]

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,229
[Music]

00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:13,369
[Music]

00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,369
[Applause]

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,599
[Music]

00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,479
[Music]

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,650
[Music]

00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:21,530
voluntary of course you say yes this is

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:22,770
my experience we completion i and also

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,810
organism

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,800
small small each one of us which is a

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:32,190
minister that is openSUSE might be from

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:42,090
people going to and particular for entry

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:45,330
and I'm a coordinator of openness and in

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,270
it I reversed my contribution is a

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:51,509
little bit death but I believe even more

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,910
may contribute there are many positive

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:56,419
benefits that can be gained from the

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,419
community

00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,449
okay

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:13,970
before we go to the doctor industry the

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,040
first thing this one's understand about

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,419
no time and I want to tell you about

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:24,490
another concept in a nutshell

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:27,110
so you application the first thing is

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,310
you will install the operating system

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,110
and then with all the dependencies then

00:05:31,310 --> 00:06:01,340
install the application and run the

00:05:33,110 --> 00:06:06,680
application but if you practice wisdom

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:09,340
itself to make this possible look for

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,550
each the comments and emails and

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,250
abductor

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,070
and opening it is basically template for

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:21,880
the PI system when you run in docker

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,880
image and he stands in the container in

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,539
[Music]

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:40,419
your own application with the doctor but

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,419
only how to treat and dr. Legaspi

00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:00,110
so doctor has publicly called doctor

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:06,140
have to scurry on the teammates you can

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:09,830
get anything you can applaud is also

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:14,170
public but this might not be the best

00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:18,050
option for your project since the person

00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:21,200
2.0 doctor registry changes medical

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,170
doctor remission and dr. mr. Muhsin is a

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,890
story and distribution solution for

00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:32,080
America he makes it with mega began

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:37,310
behind the top half and his open source

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:41,140
open source means you can become will

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:47,270
doctor a mystery on your record

00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:50,210
on-premise server but what meant

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,110
impossible Easter is delicate an

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:58,720

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:09,620
but this is open source intelligence

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:11,689
service purpose is open source of the

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,719
