together so they come but it is fairly

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:34,740
Europe so so for Asian people it is to

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:35,330

[Music]

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:17,830
initially we can be efficient but

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,830
there's a mission from your country

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:31,600

and here I want to quickly talk about

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:33,650
how to fix a meeting in Japan so my

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:36,790
communication in Japan it was 15 when

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:43,280

book so they do that

00:15:51,380 --> 00:16:23,390
theta equal to t je and we have and geek

00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:26,530

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,009
[Music]

00:18:27,320 --> 00:19:02,009
so we have a high price if you keep

00:18:38,299 --> 00:19:15,509
reading a very costly part is if a for a

00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:23,759
