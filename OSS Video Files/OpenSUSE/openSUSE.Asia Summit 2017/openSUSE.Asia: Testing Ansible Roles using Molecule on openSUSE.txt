[Music]

00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,909
[Music]

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,759
[Music]

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,130
especially for

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:22,869
yes like training in that one until one

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,260
my name is internet again spine and

00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:31,860
taupe well this by email

00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:35,490
I stole upon the tiny about generation I

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,490
in my job

00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,739
[Music]

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,500
let's introduce black

00:01:48,610 --> 00:02:00,330
and mango basically I'm using molecule

00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,330
what all this prep work to cancel anyway

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:10,600
so why I'm using article because I

00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:15,510
support with equal distance operating

00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,510
system pro fighter

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,480
so there's there's white and before I'm

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,450
using ansible I'm working in another

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,020
stock name is go check some lights is

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:42,430
good but using motorcycle so I mean the

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:45,700
preceptors Google so you see check but I

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:49,720
think when I walk to smile stop you see

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:54,940
Janet's little bit difficult because it

00:02:49,720 --> 00:03:07,330
hora Sasa so it's awkward but when you

00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:20,200
in chapter 4 but when I try using

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:27,310
ansible so this what the basic are using

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:30,970
horrible we just make sure consistent so

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:33,880
everything we change in the server we

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,520
must use inconceivable so everything we

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,380
will reproduce we will make this

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:45,750
something appreciation so when we can

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,750
replicate is the stable configuration

00:03:50,940 --> 00:04:00,239
because sometime in stock always change

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,239
before I mean

00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,300
[Music]

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,760
[Music]

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,330
yeah yeah

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:50,029
and so basically relax the less

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:52,519
corrosion a bunch of music but little

00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:57,259
bit cheated because I was level and I

00:04:52,519 --> 00:05:00,409
mean we will not change so I was using a

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:03,050
stable this one so basically we just

00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:07,129
need is a compatible

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:13,129
my department is not working for me it's

00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:19,449
not complicated but doctor this one is

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:19,449
to complicate doctor and fighters so the

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,390
[Music]

00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:40,089
UCC police under

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:55,030
yeah

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:55,030
yes publican and doctor and about

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:20,490
so when it was basically when you think

00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:24,180
although they so it's a big city for

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:33,689
provider virtualization basically we can

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:37,409
use partner and re just use what you

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:41,849
people so why when I need solutions

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:47,149
chakra because we'll stay for visioning

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:47,149
for my people

00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:05,730
so basically just

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:18,330
initiation so we can fly Michael Annett

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:23,840
our failure perspective server spec some

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:27,690
like to be some have enlisted default

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:34,770
multiple uses thoughts but for used

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:38,900
right so I'm like movie star is more

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:42,029
simple I will show you with a kiss

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,029
[Music]

00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,809
[Music]

00:07:51,830 --> 00:08:17,779
yeah maybe automation relation is

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,660
[Music]

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:45,470
basically the trustee of patience so but

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:48,110
the problem when you use googoo Saniya

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:55,140
00:08:48,110 --> 00:09:05,970
sixty-five no I will just say the quiet

00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:11,690
way the problem in so for testing I'm

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:15,090
still in India basically Indonesia

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:28,920
distribution is not problem I can use

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:32,580
everything I can find difficult to

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:37,710
change disability because we just

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:45,930
understand how generally operate so yeah

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:51,240
this abusive yes distribution ethical

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:59,720
group so when testing we make some like

00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:04,080
very good I will show you how to just

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,020
tangible that the state with dirigible

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,900
you can find the competition with

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,900
ansible so depressed

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:24,100
and this class will execute when testing

00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:28,360
next F can do it so basically we just

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:38,500
testing used install nginx and after we

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:43,690
stock the stock symbol after that the

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:47,290
world talks with frightened miss that so

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:52,990
I am using server space so what we'll be

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:55,690
testing in basically the simple way it's

00:10:52,990 --> 00:11:00,510
packaged in stuff mr. Chris Frannie

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:09,550
visit both listening simulated so

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:12,570
anything for you takes the model for

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:21,740
nesting you can access inspector ready

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:24,810
so I just missing all the testing

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,110
this kind sufficiently is already

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,110
running

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,410
let's make you an instrument because

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:42,650
sometimes yeah come the problem in us in

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:46,140
my company the setup for education

00:11:42,650 --> 00:12:21,260
something like quality C or something it

00:11:46,140 --> 00:12:24,170
just make sure it is in directly to

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,270
operating system

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,270
[Music]

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,599
[Music]

00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:57,229
yes sir first bank will directly speak

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,229
[Music]

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:13,589
is the same way music how to run so

00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:16,949
basically basically we just fight it

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:22,620
will do create instance with before

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:27,259
concentration and a player also dear an

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:32,730
article playbook after that running test

00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:36,300
and after finish I'll brief mention

00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:40,699
about will our will this racing but we

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,699
can run step-by-step sunlight

00:13:44,540 --> 00:14:03,279
and so next we have the wrong well

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:07,070
articulate but oh employee

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,580
physical improvement I mean we have a

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,390
development program about we have

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:24,770
stating for stating enter and we

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:33,080
production so basically the company

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:36,380
running we sometimes we using for no

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,470
music public others and all obviously

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,220
using it it

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:57,399
[Music]

00:14:40,220 --> 00:15:04,899
so we using possible and we making pasta

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:08,390
and we have the quiz and I mean

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:16,750
something copy and we are promised to

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:16,750
static production in equations

00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,379
[Music]

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,989
[Music]

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:21,400
take one simple button box so it was in

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:21,400
basic default maybe yeah

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,880
what the different so basically we add

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:48,860
one folder to include improvement

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,790
configuration so it's default and we

00:16:48,860 --> 00:17:04,850
have German I just created

00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:10,640
yeah I'm IP address of the machine

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:14,030
automate and server IMO comparable with

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:20,949
the friend it's it's implement something

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,949
work in production user men will in

00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:40,330
implement ansible people from taking yes

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:49,970
financeable and where my good and what

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:52,810
inventory well you will write I will

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,810
demo start

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,400
he's like

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:22,049
[Music]

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,200
[Music]

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,140
[Music]

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,279
[Music]

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,210
[Music]

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,579
[Music]

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,460
[Music]

00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,630
[Music]

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,220
even in my country

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,740
[Music]

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,700
back to

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,829
we will

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,829
[Music]

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,160
so basically their stuff

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,920
[Music]

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:32,000
we had Angela messed up in the next so

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,089
we must get ender

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,089
[Music]

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:25,980
when we start multiple cars basically

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:31,789
they will in stoppage so running maybe

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,789
to depend on your internet access

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:43,399
okay after you stop we just met make

00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,399
testing

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,059
[Music]

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,390
[Music]

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,829
[Music]

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:21,220
so because the vertical writing in fiber

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:42,990
is very very sensitive

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:46,060
if you what space yeah but it will still

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,540
when you work with error so it's no

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,350
problem

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,350
yes picture

00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,990
[Music]

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,870
still in Reverse to stop it

00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:24,370
and will serve you about how to

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:29,330
different ways for variable so they did

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:36,920
some time limit impairment Oracle and we

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:41,510
will call it a fast and sometimes we

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:45,490
will call it from template so for

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:52,430
testing just both enter and revel in

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:56,330
this profile and to kill you and this

00:26:52,430 --> 00:27:05,380
development we call it in and simple

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:08,540
protein instance in it and hope when we

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:12,680
have been in German so basically for

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:16,060
testing using the Horton from implement

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:21,620
we use ecstatic frustrating just and

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:25,940
group REM how about affirmative so

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,190
basically there are many infant variable

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,020
but continued if an audio

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,020
so maybe these are

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,170
[Music]

00:27:52,710 --> 00:28:00,210
so basically we we not get a filament

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:05,260
fall for Siebel for you know fuck-all

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:27,310
the according to save the password or no

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:30,550
we just limited access to people we so

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:33,630
but but I know that I'm still on others

00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,630
busy in south

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,950
[Music]

00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:14,559
[Music]

00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:16,990
so basically how how implements so in my

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:25,570
laptop for running articles I hope I

00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:30,029
will copy it came to surface and when

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,029
using the data centers yes

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:50,059
[Music]

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:53,090
we its I mean we divide a cake based on

00:29:50,059 --> 00:30:02,659
everyone so the K for the staging

00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:07,129
furniture but only people we can just

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:11,629
