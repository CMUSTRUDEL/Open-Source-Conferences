speakers yeah

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,410
as already mentioned that so and this is

00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:10,290
like as you can access from this URL so

00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:19,110

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:32,009
- kay so but it is massive ego and I'm

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:35,789
what he posed and my office is in Tokyo

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,940
and I am working for hopeful Sachs

00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:42,489
things I'm looking for OpenStack

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,489
[Music]

00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,519
[Music]

00:01:49,130 --> 00:02:40,400
I was so so Chinese oh yeah something is

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:45,140
a Brazilian and he is also a black cord

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:54,680
edema and he is perceived and then

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:58,910
walking so by the way I am actually new

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:05,200
being aa openSUSE so this is my case

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:14,230
this is my groom and it's my servers

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:18,349
servers one 320 dollars which is a

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:21,349
carrier luck so it's the

00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:24,349
so yeah

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:30,230
and now this is now restoring the

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:35,750
opposition the oddity yeah

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:39,069
so I'm very happy and I'm actually this

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:44,480
is the first time to join

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:48,319
openSUSE event so what I think too the

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,180
first thing first time and speaking of

00:03:48,319 --> 00:04:10,599
the first time so I'm very happy but

00:03:52,180 --> 00:04:17,079
nervous so I actually have there are any

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:22,160
native English speakers here okay yeah

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:25,789
and I actually have one more I'm

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,349
wondering which language is the best in

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:31,729
this talk I mean to do I use Japanese or

00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:35,710
should I use English

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:41,630
I actually mixed theory but I'm I think

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:45,020
English is because I think most of the

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:52,909
people understand English right so if I

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:56,510
use Japanese people understand yeah

00:04:52,909 --> 00:05:01,110
so what's to talk about transformation

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:04,860
our experiences so what happened

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,409
asked and the second thing these are

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,780
challenges there are some lot of

00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:14,430
challenges and it's based on their

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,030
culture or language disappear and the

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:26,099
third one is overcoming obstacles

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:29,310
overcoming challenges the last one is a

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:36,659
holding we promise I will talk about

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:42,599
some tips so first one is a culture

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:46,319
challenges so so from my perspective

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:50,789
this is my first perspective I actually

00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:55,259
don't say this all the Japanese people

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:58,430
thinking about this I don't say what but

00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:04,169
I think many of the Japanese people

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:09,060
agree with these things so yeah first

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:12,000
one is do not express clearly like yes

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,740
or no we don't say yes or no actually

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,710
very so many people very confusing about

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,710
who've already so but we shoot

00:06:21,870 --> 00:07:16,979
say we should say yes or no clearly in

00:06:25,139 --> 00:07:21,960
many cases this is about we just keep

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:29,430
information so the most of the Japanese

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:36,020
language is information so it's very

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:46,020
different than normal English so we

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:49,500
actually we don't

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,940
the information was right on that but

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:59,389
it's a bit difficult to understand for

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,389
the people so I try to I try to

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,320
only the economy so we are deep enough

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,910
besides in the past years so we don't

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,350
need to actually we don't need to

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:23,060
actually have a conversation with the 40

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:27,030
people to get business for many years I

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:46,920
think so that's the reason why we need

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:50,640
to English so much so we actually found

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,520
it by the ocean and the sea yeah you can

00:08:50,640 --> 00:09:23,520
see the to believe you you already know

00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:28,850
that but we don't we don't many years

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:33,149
but also

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:37,499
so we have a lot of conferences like

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:40,709
this learning English is very important

00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:46,069
these days the next one is a personal

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:49,290
reading writing in school education so

00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:53,189
this is reading and writing is very

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:57,619
important but it's not enough to have a

00:09:53,189 --> 00:10:05,959
conversation with people because

00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:09,360
conversation we need it's a challenge

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,040
next one is a transition pronunciation

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:23,279
and the government is very different

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:31,100
from English for example is different

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:37,350
but in Japanese it's the same so example

00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:44,069
right right hand like he's a very

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:49,350
different to drugs so and you

00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:53,119
distinguish to that so also a

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:57,809
challenging and the second sample is

00:10:53,119 --> 00:11:04,220
teams found accent we Japanese don't

00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:04,220
have the sound a sound that

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,040
has a fan of tea starts yeah like that

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:24,160
we say probably in Japanese Japanese

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:31,240
English so it's a very different

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:37,870
translation in the first one is a German

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:42,100
perspective so very simple example very

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:45,370
simple example in English the normal

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,940
order is a sequence it's a subject or

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:58,140
object but in Japanese no more modern is

00:11:48,940 --> 00:12:03,340
a subject object or so that image we say

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:08,260
they show great right but in Japanese we

00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:12,640
say color noir to paradise kiss so this

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:15,340
means so paranoia means that they and

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:19,450
the chocolate with chocolate and the -

00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:22,990
KJ's means love so that they choke Allah

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,530
this sounds a poetic butter it's very

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,100
weird

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:31,120
so we need to change our brain to in

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,020
this way

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,980
six-two we need to speak to

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,980
in this plane so it's a very difficult

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:50,760
katakana world we have three titles

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,350
characters in Japanese first one is a

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,620
country country is a Chinese character

00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:01,910
[Music]

00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:19,339
Donna and the last one is economies

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:31,589
actually useful many Imported sometimes

00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:35,640
because we understand in katakana this

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:38,520
is the we say we don't say McDonald's

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,060
new Japanese we say in Japanese but we

00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:44,910
don't know at all like that so if you

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:49,770
say McDonald's we don't understand

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:53,670
exactly so and I say we don't know but

00:13:49,770 --> 00:14:02,550
you don't understand that so it's very

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:07,410
different last one is a Japanese method

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:11,850
English we say what's a able was I so

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,500
this is all so confusing because first

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:17,459
one is impossible possible

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,770
do you know that Passport the possible

00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:26,040
means a personal computer PC

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:29,820
but we Japanese some of the Japanese be

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,800
the possible in the English world but

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,800
it's not English English

00:14:41,790 --> 00:16:10,230
[Music]

00:14:45,480 --> 00:16:16,360
yeah so so so so Chinese pronunciation

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:20,860
is also different from the English to

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:23,670
the Japanese situation and the drama is

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,670
also different

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:40,390
that's one because like Oh Heidi is a I

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:43,550
love you like so it's a same other

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:49,880
English and the writing is hard

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:54,190
yeah yeah yes and the next guy is is I

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,190
mean somehow it isn't either

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:05,780
conversation do you mean sooner way

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:20,180
express the responses shouldn't direct

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:24,140
well it sounded rude so yeah Tommy

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:37,490
where's Tommy is the gazillion uses

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:46,850
today I can't read this correctly but

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:51,580
yeah but he said so English it's a bit

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:56,150
for us but in Spanish or ought to be

00:17:51,580 --> 00:18:02,680
like it's a it's a house beautiful like

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:02,680
this oh so it's different

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:15,060
yeah there is no JSON or JSON JSON is a

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,060
bit

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:30,530
I'm using Apple and the educational

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:33,290
system is for teaching the border it's

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:42,280
very different vantage ground so they

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:42,280
face to ten countries but English is not

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,450
[Music]

00:18:50,650 --> 00:19:02,300
it's week after graduated people we

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:06,260
couldn't ask English is very important

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:12,470
so the first time I noticed on stomach

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:15,110
yes he was there but he actually have a

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,950
conversation with chat - I'll see you a

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:24,020
stack like that but in OpenStack summit

00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,830
like this event very deeply I bet he had

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:31,190
a first time to having to face to face

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:35,630
but he cannot use the English

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:50,390
frequenters friendly so he very

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:55,240
surprised in this is a charm

00:19:50,390 --> 00:20:02,179
it's not the only one things but yeah

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:11,179
yes make other mistakes so it's not too

00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:17,860
critical attitude I think so there are a

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:22,250
lot of challenges we faced but we so we

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:26,600
listed on four skills for that first one

00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:29,000
is a reading secondary's ragging and the

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,500
listening are speaking so firstly it's

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,630
already creating part so reading is I

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:44,740
think most I think the easiest part to

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:53,139
learn to get the skill you can because

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:57,799
we can we already educated product and

00:20:53,139 --> 00:21:05,659
reading we can read as many times as we

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:08,510
need if we read webpages in English we

00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:09,330
can read this and we can use a

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,630
dictionary

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:18,990
world internet students were like that

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:22,350
it's it's literally useful but it'll be

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:26,580
one of the most important skill because

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:30,690
most of the open source conversation is

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:34,770
in the mailing list what child like I

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,680
see when a flag was something like so if

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:42,030
we cannot read English he cannot

00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:47,970
understand everything so the rating

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:52,850
scale in which various winnings vary but

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:56,460
sometimes very long slit in mailing list

00:21:52,850 --> 00:22:01,440
happens but the conclusion is very

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:05,910
unclear the very difficult situation for

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:12,030
me especially because it's there is a

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:18,300
chameleon but I just couldn't understand

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:21,030
it or there is no conclusion but yeah if

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:25,650
there is no conclusion I cannot

00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:32,210
understand the confusion but I cannot

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:35,210
decided I cannot understand which is I

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:35,210
mean

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,530
so I can understand that we achieve the

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:50,860
answer so yeah sometimes it's very

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:59,310
confusing and I see conversation goes

00:22:50,860 --> 00:23:03,700
fast the Hennessy world so if the

00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:06,870
conversation goes quickly very fast we

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:13,960
cannot understand I cannot understand

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:21,810
because sometimes the conversation some

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:21,810
guys talking about different topics so

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:33,100
lots of information sometimes in reading

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,350
there is no information it's very

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:52,240
difficult to treat the information for

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:57,970
that so we cannot understand it and the

00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:04,540
ranking scale is also important of

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:09,280
course yeah so government part I already

00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:12,330
mentioned that is it's very different

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,060
from many

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:18,220
languages like this and the second

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,410
always writing down the beautiful

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,070
sentences is very hard

00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:28,890
yeah for especially for me or some other

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:43,570
guys so we actually use simple sentences

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:50,170
but it's sometimes we cannot put feeling

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:57,580
or some other things so so we should try

00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:59,680
to English writing skill I already

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:05,410
mentioned that as part of exciting mrs.

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:09,280
P in chat so sometimes the child is very

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:14,580
quickly but if the rating scale with

00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:22,540
less it's very hard to follow the

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:28,930
conversation when the listening skill so

00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:33,400
variety of accents like us well UK as

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:37,320
police or Australian or Chinese Japanese

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:43,019
or Germany or

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:47,190
yeah like that so and in the negative

00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:51,600
countries like us the it's very depends

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:55,980
on the area were AG's were like that

00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:03,389
it's there are a lot of American accent

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:08,730
right so but we actually need to use do

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:12,470
about so it's very challenging and that

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:15,990
speed and native speakers very quickly

00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:18,539
speaking very quickly so it's also

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,750
difficult and that the cavalry and the

00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:26,159
grammar is also needed required in the

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:28,259
conversation you real-time so it's very

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:34,519
difficult right and the noisy

00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:38,480
environments like dinosaur-like the

00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:43,649
situations it's very compact or to

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:46,320
understand what they say and speaking

00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:53,309
speaking is I think the most difficult

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:59,190
part because yeah this very output skill

00:26:53,309 --> 00:27:01,320
is difficult and the translation with

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:07,239
very different

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,239
[Music]

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:17,380
in English and it's beyond through

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:22,590
frequency is constant regalia because if

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:31,630
less speed were frequency fluently

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:33,520
people feel boring so someone is a

00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:40,720
four-camera in the drama is also

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:45,899
required right so from here I will talk

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,899
about to overcome obstacles challenges

00:27:46,080 --> 00:28:00,450
so so you don't need to so you may not

00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:00,450
on outstanding level so it's not clock

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:16,179
so if you get the English you don't need

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:20,200
to we don't need to get traffic to

00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:28,419
English skills I think you can start as

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:36,450
a anytime so you can just try that okay

00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:36,450
so so so I will skip that

00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:49,360
it's a summary of the tips so with in

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:53,730
writing we can we can use English every

00:28:49,360 --> 00:29:00,220
day with like these tools with something

00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:03,390
we can learn English we can try an

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:09,690
exercise training exercise at English

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:14,350
every day so eventually we can get more

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:17,530
so newcomers for open source project

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:21,310
like openSUSE like that so be friendly

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:25,060
or find a major and aspiration and it

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:31,140
shall appear to others yeah diversity is

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:36,550
important for most of the pappases

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:54,400
advanced giving toward a skill I will

00:29:36,550 --> 00:30:02,730
try that that's right so that's it thank
