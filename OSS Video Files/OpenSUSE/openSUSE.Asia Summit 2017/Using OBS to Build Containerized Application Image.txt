say today you are seeing this image very

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:54,500
very often blaster Pro about the big OBS

00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:01,760
and it's out with direct a teammate by

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:09,220
our games see we have only 5 chapter of

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,220
captain's decision sono solo

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:20,840
okay the doctor will say accountant OBS

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:28,940
project let's try to build a simple and

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:38,510
he made mostly coming from a teammate in

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:43,280
a project we are we will try to see how

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,960
the target bit of a gimmick on OBS let's

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:54,740
see what the typical teammates build

00:03:44,960 --> 00:04:01,030
support our fights okay except we charge

00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:11,980
them in my improv no fell or to say okay

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:11,980
who is true him have tried obvious okay

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:22,610
Candace I'm so yeah yeah we are mostly

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:27,050
new visitor about the vs OBS dance form

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:31,280
of bills apiece but the first time if

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:34,660
it's appreciate your service but then

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,660
they change the name

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:57,430
so these chapter we will see mostly my

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:57,430
my my don't you see you about

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:12,130
what difference is so happy

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:31,720
makes another happier that kondogbia

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:38,850
other battery - how can i regret every

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:43,680
movie system mostly there is no require

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:48,550
step - to watch also happy happy made

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,280
you can see other stuff other

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:57,550
experiments a configuration you are the

00:05:51,280 --> 00:06:07,240
agreements seems to be let it be run

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:10,960
from reckon I don t make me happier we

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:16,660
are at a nature that you asked all my

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:27,490
teammates are basically from and every

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:32,080
for the hall directories we but maybe

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:36,130
you can read organize saw it is will you

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,000
see that they director a new we started

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,000
well

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:52,050
the inventory where can I request a

00:06:43,740 --> 00:07:08,130
Phoenix how how can we how can we do to

00:06:52,050 --> 00:07:11,820
request a given issue you if your friend

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:20,849
on you you know who the differ police

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:24,979
you can ask me order to produce when you

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:31,910
give the support so empty means remember

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:39,930
from the IMC or the github project site

00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:43,080
so this session is specially for

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:48,800
development that equally want to know

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:57,150
how to produce a giving through OBS

00:07:48,800 --> 00:08:01,080
usually OBS its building package from is

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,680
required and produced it up here in a

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:09,750
second but you know it obvious if you

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:14,720
see the site is turn of the combination

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:20,610
how to produce at the package except a

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:23,210
package if they package or I don't know

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,210
I just

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,740
but there is an issue that maybe I don't

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:39,970
know then the packets can be killed by

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:50,220
OBS no idea no there is no need to have

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:50,220
to guess how to

00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,660
yeah IBM actually did okay what we can

00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:09,100
be built from yes now talking about

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:12,959
ultimate Yogi's is it's very differently

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:21,279
very successfully generate a teammate

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:26,949
through obedience so this is your first

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:30,550
chapter you see what is obvious the

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:35,410
always component that we usually see

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:39,339
from the view of the user of the picture

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,439
of your PS we are usually using of an

00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:49,769
interface and where you are

00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:49,769
the other component is you know okay

00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:05,410
okay most of the packages usually use

00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:14,949
the web UI this is fun it's funny if you

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:22,720
built a cage okay wait wait the main

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:31,800
webpage of the op-eds is obvious the

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:35,040
basis of the web UI is the the way

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,040
if you

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:48,410
this is the example of the eye when

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,410
either face

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,490
okay this is the small in empower bottle

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,750
yes

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:08,120
let's just go to the differences to

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,470
other methods what is the dependent but

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,520
on inferences the other matters we

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:21,860
activate the OBS this is tripod because

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:27,740
the infrastructure the future but refine

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:32,360
it by OBS is it's really perfectly easy

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:36,380
to use platform it is using the public

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:41,720
of your instances to reproduce every

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:43,700
minute which we will the image given in

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,020
OBS is the many consistent and

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:50,540
reproducible way you know the technology

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:55,630
is good is excellent if there is

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,630
consistent automatic and depreciable

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:59,190
so we had expenses so like the office

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,190
that can be updated

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:11,220
yeah it is option number of yes we are

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:11,220
provided for you really easy

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:26,390
so the will decision we will see how to

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:30,990
make a payment through OBS a fire

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:35,090
the first thing you you have to do how

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:40,200
to on how to give an image to do get is

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:54,630
heaven but you see a cow right yeah you

00:13:40,200 --> 00:14:06,060
have to lead into the we will forget

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:08,880
that we can okay you can open the page

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:21,090
of the OBS but upon a waste

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:23,100
expenses are you sign up with you if you

00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:32,010
not have get your come straight down

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:37,170
sign up so if you have login with your

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:40,980
account you can go to the main page of

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:45,420
the obvious project you meet because we

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:49,070
are going to do mate and just your

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:54,000
template and create a party this is the

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:58,750
example is just example how to produce

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:04,870
it's template standard repent for you to

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:07,630
see how the port of doing an image PCP

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:11,770
is give you if you have one now year of

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:18,490
your account you try you can try to see

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:23,260
how to wait how do how to do this

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:30,820
manually manually you we can use the CII

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:38,610
edifice be of SC so you open your

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:43,810
attorney now run the command of OAC

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:48,310
usually require your presence a password

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,010
you put in there enter twice your

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,620
password again

00:15:50,010 --> 00:16:03,430
then quit you project you want your

00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:09,570
metaphorical this is the common command

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:11,880
the we will for this where we make Oh

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:19,020
Symmetra decades

00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:24,960
yeah or see meta project I mean II home

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:30,130
along your vision if you release command

00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,800
you have to choose one but the build

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:36,220
project target project of your obvious

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:43,270
project this is the example of the meta

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:47,960
package of your project in OBS most of

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:53,770
the wine automatically produce my view

00:16:47,960 --> 00:17:00,640
by you but some of their lines has to be

00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:03,830
typed by value especially in this slide

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,540
the first Iranian have image the park if

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:12,980
you want to build the tunnel okay if you

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:17,559
want to just produce a teammate commonly

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:24,199
to keep its package put your light shine

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:28,390
on this line maybe have said that the

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:41,960
target particle project of the image to

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:47,110
all the other one and so on although

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:51,440
this is good is within the US one

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:54,740
because because the package that one

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,900
produced by OBS have to build in the

00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:07,220
other question of your filter game not

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:12,230
the US so you can you can you know it

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:14,270
can be it can give an in u.s. one in US

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,990
version of the operating system can be

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:25,640
confirmed where all the of The Passion

00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:28,940
of the so the example of the slightly is

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:34,520
you see focused on the other person of

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:42,510
the sample

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:47,340
now the team a limited support another

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:56,690
father we have to prepare to take the

00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:59,730
image is why am L this is like file the

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:04,500
form of the fire of the activated by

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:08,430
about half it is the empty mix named the

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,150
package the OBS for digital will follow

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:16,260
the name because the name that you put

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:19,220
in this one will patch through

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:24,650
ingredients you know ingredients is

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:27,630
allocated in their sleep this is if you

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:30,590
continue you'll see the this is the line

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:36,590
that commonly used by the occasion

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,590
asleep the skip behind behind the

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:51,180
machine that will produce your okay FCB

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:57,230
me really simple this is the the script

00:19:51,180 --> 00:20:00,260
that I put from the image in approaching

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,980
[Music]

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:09,050
the package that will be filled with the

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:14,060
cap will take a nice little step boy you

00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:19,400
dependent is the 2d this is the

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:21,930
information that the package Tom prom

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:27,350
this is the script the cover the script

00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,350
that will produce your image

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:44,220
mostly because have said that mostly

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:44,220
implemented is that like you came yeah I

00:20:45,360 --> 00:21:16,090
have since I okay at the Father we have

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:28,950
to profile is receptive farm it is

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:36,130
commonly used by will produce your image

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:38,710
what that equation okay the next one if

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,130
you built your image on your planet

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,660
Earth

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:52,350
OBS instance this package is required to

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:57,670
have this is the package coming from the

00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:02,620
rhetoric or you can hit command and

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:05,820
inside of the SF is if you will be

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,820
processed from your guess

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:22,540
okay and the requirement of maybe this

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,540
is the original option on this section

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,590
you can put on the fire

00:22:35,770 --> 00:23:22,320
so if you have okay

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,150
[Music]
