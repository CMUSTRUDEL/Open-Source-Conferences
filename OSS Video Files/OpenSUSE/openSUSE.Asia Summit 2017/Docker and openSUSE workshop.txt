	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,160
okay Showtime

00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,690
so first of all you can use the QR code

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,250
to scan is live or you can use the shot

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:22,529
Google URL which is partly so the URL is

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:27,990
do you know how that GL pink Jamie m6

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:32,369
big cube sumo W big pain you can access

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,610
this so all the information and all the

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,910
step-by-step documentation is using a

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,040
slide and all that academic Oliver can

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,950
read by putting at the hospital so not

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,710
worry if you have this QR code and and

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,710
you have this URL began

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,580
messed up

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:04,970
so engineers myself I am the Jamali over

00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:09,080
to say remember and no promotion first

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:13,560
so actually Taiwan we have a workshop

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:17,550
any burst from last year August until

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,700
now so we have a 14 months to continue

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,100
to have workshop everyone's with the

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,830
local with the local group so we have a

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,090
many topic which the avoidant work with

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,700
the darker and seabone staff and others

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,369
which are different workshop so last

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,790
that's our Facebook with with the Taiwan

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:50,040
mobile users group and about a tiny bit

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:51,990
because I also point ok so first of all

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,300
I want to introduce parties open social

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,330
project so open social pocket is make

00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:01,350
anyone to make a usable in the user

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:05,160
friendly Venus dispersion so what's the

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,619
picture so if we want a little bit we

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,840
already use them organisms that do not

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,020
use the Susan I wanted to introduce

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
three features for us very important one

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,710
is for he asked so if you have yes

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,590
you have a visor to do anything and all

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,470
of you want to do is to create a NASA

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,069
NASA NASA so you can use the Y asta to

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,580
to create a DHCP server of a firewall in

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,250
five minute even modules and to is

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,890
obvious obviously is called open field

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:41,810
service that means you can put your

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:45,270
source code to the crop and you can to

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:48,720
pack it - not many diffusion poison of

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,600
over two-thirds less centralized bunch

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,600
of and

00:02:49,600 --> 00:03:00,100
distribution so for over two places they

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:04,540
always do that they use the software

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,240
that always with a dog sled such such

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,600
any program they want to install and

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,960
just one thing stuff so they can install

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,900
one with an inter text to you have

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,720
instantly proceeded so we are not just

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,560
install the primary you are in external

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,660
to custody that means when these firing

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,230
when this actually upgraded they would

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,710
notice

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:36,250
hey this program can be tolerated so

00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:39,040
give you septic okay so three is open

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:43,150
Super Cub week but probably I think this

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,860
morning Rita Rita told tourists so

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:50,530
company is for loading update dispute so

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,450
nada means you always keep very very in

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:58,660
it sometimes you have some risk

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:05,140
because the packages to me okay so for

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:12,430
me if I always I use me but in some test

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:15,280
motion machine I used okay so today's

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,690
agenda so first I will introduce what is

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,459
talking and how to install packages and

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,190
we will practice some soccerbase to

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:29,770
comment and to run a docker container

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:34,830
and to build a properly match most of

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:39,970
you I wanted as a question first

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:43,060
do you know we have a last doctor module

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:48,370
that means we have a GUI graphical user

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:51,850
interface with the target well it will

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,690
be more convenient so in the suture or

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,639
obvious

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:59,169
openSUSE we have a target module that

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:06,820
means you can use the GUI or GUI tool to

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:10,780
manager your attacker name so in the new

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,820
stock so far it's dr. Thackery's that is

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,870
the container so far in the container so

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:21,700
you might be no night is a mercerized we

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,490
call it advertised sometimes I want to

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,649
make this time

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,649
[Music]

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,290
if we insist October in a a very good

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,560
environment movies using some paper has

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:43,570
a very interesting environment and

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,640
Wanaka vehicle back to you a school unit

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:53,230
what do you do in a passion just go

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,640
movies machine or use or use the ghost

00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:00,220
to copy the Machine Man

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:03,260
if you only have this cone machine okay

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,280
so when we have a virtual machine

00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,490
it was a hey respect you this Amanda

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,970
meat is burning interest

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:18,410
so could you copy your motivation to me

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:21,560
so question one how about a slice with

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,900
the virtual machine if we want to come

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:30,410
here a virtual machine powers Iceland

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:34,160
may be a nearby tanki of Iraq so

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,360
question two if you are running enable

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,220
virtual machine how many trials and how

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,420
many memory we must

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,180
I mean if we open the virtual machine

00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,270
for example Windows XP Windows 10 with a

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:57,810
7 for you over the power and you can

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:58,880
start to use maybe 3 means 5 minute okay

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,460
[Music]

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:07,800
so if you use the document so what is

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:13,010
not I always like to say Parker is the

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:16,830
lightweight version but virtual machine

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:20,390
virtualized a whole machine so I always

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:25,730
talk to my students a doctor is

00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:28,830
virtualize what virtualized application

00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:31,080
they don't realize all of things they

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,860
don't they don't realize how how where

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:39,440
or something else they only utilize them

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:43,830
upon occasion environment tsunami what

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,259
not mean if you open the talker you open

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:51,020
a container just one second

00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:54,439
how many memory they will use if you

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,330
open the virtual machine if you all have

00:07:54,439 --> 00:08:02,300
Windows machine with you might be using

00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:06,439
200 megabytes if you use the Parker you

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,229
only use how many usage you really use

00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:14,789
for example five

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:17,759
even X okay so what watch it is

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:23,210
Oh reciprocation is very interesting

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:26,969
till you get me if you start very easy

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,699
they are back on top so you can you can

00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:36,000
you get them from the internet just what

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:39,089
comment dr. fool anyone

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,099
[Music]

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:46,260
just tell me give me a dollar fine

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:49,130
sacrifice that as Kiko too far is the

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:52,829
test fire it'll be 1k damage obtained

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,870
very small even can mail to you so you

00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:58,769
can use this type of item to view

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:02,310
yourself in your environment and in a

00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:06,360
darker fire any step image that you

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,720
change is a very different there so in a

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,100
in attack your file you can see what

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:19,170
will be changed in any step so you can

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:22,230
see very clearly so now I think I think

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,569
it's time for dr. Dwyer because you will

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,860
know you sucker

00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:31,350
and they will use doctor but we anyway

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,069
have a Tyson pray for Colonel went on

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,329
people and they have viz the oil in

00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:41,480
faster in Farrakhan

00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:46,510
- aw use docker microscope gives the to

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:50,300
cry of doctor one who is the hyper-v

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:55,250
what you study they use that advantage

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:59,269
meanest is bound to have to use them the

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:02,839
doctor so Venus you stocker Windows you

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,500
stalker and the VMO is target so he was

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,430
a man

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:13,000
bento the user you can create a target

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:18,380
faster and you can kill them some tech

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,529
nothing what I mean you can use data in

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,209
different dispute and code darker in the

00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:29,510
line no I want to call a darker in

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:32,360
Nina's okay once I want to stay if you

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,510
you stalker because they have a grocer

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,380
eyes on advertised for application so

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,740
they use the kernel in the same machine

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:47,810
that means what that means if we use we

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,949
use Windows you only can use them we if

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:53,899
you use a Venus

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:58,339
you can use the newest ok ok because

00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:02,480
they use the distinction so even you

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:05,089
will see that why they are to conquer in

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,709
the windows one is hyper-v to know that

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:12,050
windows container one is use the

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:18,410
cleaners and use the Venus to use the

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:22,370
container so they can use first so funny

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:25,250
is container the same so they serve a

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,000
container used I should a stand OS

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:33,829
kernel and they just isolate they just

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,800
isolate an environment that is a very

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:39,740
very interesting toy that means if you

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,310
use if you use the virtual machine how

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,519
is the right to the fiscal machine to

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:49,329
the virtual machine to the best policy

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,490
if you want fiscal fiscal machine

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:54,860
sometimes they will take all the best

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,890
man you might be used to Austrian

00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,100
washing machine right then you will be

00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:05,350
you be used for but they will be

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:08,600
overcome it but if you use the darker

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:13,329
they just used a poison pretend with

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:18,680
megabyte or 20 megabytes on America so

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:23,890
the radio will be more even one to five

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,890
or one to ten and remember is easy to

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:33,260
kill ok so what is the timer feature one

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,649
is very my way to is very fast when you

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,839
enable a doctor just a few second one

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:43,339
second to a second is very fast and you

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:46,579
can deploy and scale very easy because

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,100
you can deploy and use the same docker

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:53,260
container in different very funny and

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,260
you just use the understand

00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,710
[Music]

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:10,310
so I want his friend some keyboard for

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,120
the database what is dementia what is

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:17,029
the double event so taboo image is that

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,329
temperate is a read only temporary to

00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:23,329
run docker container so we have a

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:27,649
temporary we used this temporary to Kali

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:30,230
or two for container tomorrow so

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:35,209
container the difference here is the

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:38,630
container and image is the event is free

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:43,459
only but that from Hanna you belong to

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:47,930
layer for writable so you will use the

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:51,500
image to copy up to a calculative rocker

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:56,420
so what is resisting resisting is the

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,450
price a whole phrase holder to put you

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:05,329
image so there were two kinds of bridges

00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:09,459
one is for public recorded tomahawk yeah

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:11,600
he was a battleground tracker stove

00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:14,870
basically they are the same just

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,050
different function so type of crowd and

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:21,640
that provision had more facilities that

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,100
are half but they use the same register

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:30,020
Pakistan you can you can upload your

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,070
darker image to sale to buy in a

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:35,050
drugstore

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:40,670
and from the private richest one is for

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:44,510
packages is a container to but the good

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:48,670
point is is the darker the paper is it's

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:53,020
only register so if you send some API

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:58,630
okay get my image up it was a okay

00:14:53,020 --> 00:15:02,620
but no mastication and no users

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,680
management so there's a crane it called

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,830
apostles

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,460
we have Indonesia friend just introduced

00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:18,760
this project in this project possible so

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:22,030
how much others focus is a GUI interface

00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,090
to the data richest they can give a Jew

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:30,430
by user interface they can give someone

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:32,920
or some group classification and is easy

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,610
to install with the container or a feast

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,740
on achievement very friendly and easy

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:44,920
project it's for sure

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,920
so data architecture tab use the client

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,130
server side ok you can present tonight

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,790
server in the same machine so if someone

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,040
say ok Packard brought some container

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,980
he will you will send an API to the

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,440
constant oh I want University

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,790
so in this machine they don't ever open

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:11,050
Susan mentioned able to cover the ridges

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:18,580

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:47,530
covenant it might be the inner private

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:49,440
richest they are some fight an argument

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:54,370
this year

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,730
why because saying attacker get might

00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:00,460
because of money on the United State or

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,860

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:08,050
decide to took the country version one

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,820
is order in frustration one is advising

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,660

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,780
man if there's a Susa enterprise for

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,880

that under the darkest one because it's

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,070

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,289
[Music]

00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,680

[Music]

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:59,970
so if you only change your double image

00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,970
just yep use the darker

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,030
[Music]

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,730
well you know first awardee was innocent

00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:11,190
it does not thank you right

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:20,070
so if I want to get some broccoli major

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:23,630
let's do another easy one I can use a

00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:26,809
dr. Poole and you just type this never

00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,809
[Music]

00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:42,960
see was done up on Internet okay so he

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,250
will see there is a busy box and how

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:52,200
about the size one megabyte way small

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:57,720
and so the easy way is we can use a

00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:02,040
darker fool and pour something we can do

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,520
it we can do it at the same time so we

00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:10,100
can use the other images to check -

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:19,080
already download the data images easy

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:23,010
okay so you are doing about how to get

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:26,790
the total image expanded but another

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:32,460
part it is so what would I do if I using

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:38,600
a doctor so the same you can click link

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,600
I already do something here

00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:49,190
so if you technically you will commit

00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:54,609
you know dr. Hopp so just like a google

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,609
okay you can easily - such for example

00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,139
[Music]

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,959
you will see some nodules come in and

00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:16,819
not use is the application to manage a

00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:19,129
preacher server or something alone yeah

00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:23,179
you will see there are many content here

00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:25,239
so question would be which one is the

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:30,169
best

00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:36,699
so there are two point one to see is

00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:41,959
option okay to move to see how many

00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:45,440
don't know how many first they have the

00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:49,219
biggest one is the popular one okay so

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:58,250
we can try to such a sorcerer and when

00:30:49,219 --> 00:31:01,900
you click you loser - you will see what

00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:17,210
okay you see them working some

00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:21,740
innovation man x3 see the money here you

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:23,870
can see some ten twenty four twenty two

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,080
point two twenty twenty twenty two

00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:35,120
points will and leave that Pete our

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:37,880
latest is a tech head ok so that means

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,830
you can use a container and older the

00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,460
virtual I walked around

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:45,770
openSUSE 24.2 over to the right 4.3 I

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,640
want to use the table suitor where they

00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:52,730
will travel to chop a mystery why

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:57,039
because you will every nation even I

00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:02,809
agree might be the David with some

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:05,409
library for example GDK some some

00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:09,650
especially the sound which beta version

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:12,169
for a 440 subluxation so maybe someone

00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:15,200
will say why I use the worship of Gy is

00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:17,960
a container because my in ERP

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,690
applications I don't suppose the new the

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,380
new one word of 20 volt or industry the

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,919
libraries to new so user so you use the

00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,470
[Music]

00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:34,600
24 one two or maybe older version and

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,600
for the container

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,830
so the first of all you can use you can

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,750
use the background assumption and the

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,750
second one you can use the pedometers

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,209
[Music]

00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:09,480
you will find so point is first

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:14,909
difference if you use the word or you

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,940
use that coming up there's some issue

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:22,260
this is some suggestion with the partial

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,460
comment so if you use wet or use the the

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,120
comic was different

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:36,030
yeah easy if you use the darker starch

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:39,929
openSUSE do you see the tape now we can

00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:43,000
see the tech just use the darker of such

00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:46,020
some imaginary

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,790
give us a home but I really want to know

00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:54,240
how many tenth or protect in the West

00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:56,770
preventing all of you that you ever get

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,110
and feel today okay

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,570
I think there will be a future function

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,790
they might be polite because they say

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,120
this respond parenting is not from

00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:12,120
darker okay

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:18,720
and no worrying and don't be too dry

00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:25,450
because I already tell you that mutation

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,320
okay so one question before we start the

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:31,950
party stuff

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:35,880
why we use docker why will you start

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:39,550
very simple if you are put up energy say

00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:43,660
how many working out how many walking

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:50,590
tails if you want if you might want to a

00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:53,650
wet but if I want to have something if

00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,020
you want to give a call them over an FTP

00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:00,070
File Transfer Protocol service server

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:04,170
you will want to give a web server how

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,170
many times you need if you use aperture

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:16,690
maybe our maybe day maybe what we give

00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:22,000
you if you use a darker and to tell you

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:24,210
I can't make any inquiry just buffer

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,190
pool

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:33,130
Packard walk we will do that today

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:35,350
not very long some eventually that's the

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:39,270
reason that's the reason that we start

00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:43,960
to use docker because we can to freeze a

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:46,510
statement or we can do some service with

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,970
the doctor so you might be you might

00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:54,850
hear people with the server exit so if

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:59,220
you use the buffer or some technique

00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:03,880
bird burning atomizer you might be known

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:09,010
for now the old machine or the service

00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:12,310
are alive they are pistol or a washing

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:15,220
machine but if you use docker for our

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:21,160
minds it might be a chance to do that

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:24,400
what has only to machine back which to

00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,880
measure what is on a total the coal

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,760
oxide to you to accept user requests for

00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:38,020
echo the is a say okay I want to enter a

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:43,050
speed a doctor and this photo name to

00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:48,880
combine many piscano and native

00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:53,880
to analyze so with the a nice finish

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:58,840
they put a spoke to the result to the

00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,270
finest and only the Tennyson so if you

00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,170
are minds with the talker or some some

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:11,140
race service there's only two no keep it

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:14,770
up so the other no you what step by step

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:18,370
I to code so the coup point is they can

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:20,500
share the Odin resource if you have

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,830
experience to use the virtual machine

00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:26,080
you will no matter even though they

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:30,160
would never tell you are only use a

00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:33,370
virtual machine show so what so you can

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,250
combine many contain resources but

00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,980
actually you will know this this fiscal

00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,640
ship is one machine is this risk

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:47,320
aversion is to be able this is street

00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:50,280
but they they will not pants you will

00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,730
talk if it would be very easy to do that

00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,820
okay so next

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,820
and now some please

00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,369
[Music]

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:18,290
[Music]

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:26,020
so second why we use the rocker who

00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:29,159
openSUSE the pony is we don't assign tab

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,159
[Music]

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,460
you will see him

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:50,290
[Music]

00:38:47,100 --> 00:39:09,730
if it was something but we resolved the

00:38:50,290 --> 00:39:12,480
technical nevertheless even a new one in

00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,480
fact why

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:24,360
anyone tell me

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,360
[Music]

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:33,160
I

00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:36,529
[Music]

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:41,749
so for a dementia we don't care about

00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:44,900
name because we care about it ID to the

00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:52,339
see the 24.3 and the Denny's they have

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:57,019
image Adi understand just to know that

00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:59,539
ID so why I say the name is not

00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:02,599
important that is that is very simple

00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:05,329
because you abuse yourself container and

00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,449
then is another very important because

00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:10,640
when you get everything is ready you

00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:14,119
will change in an end that means it will

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:18,499
change the tab and push it to your

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,809
company will push to you back at home so

00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,600
we have no worry about that and then is

00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:32,340
not important

00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:32,340
[Music]

00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:41,379
so this is our first and handsome

00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:44,109
our first there - how to download a

00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:47,759
documentary so we use a dagger cool -

00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:52,209
Dominic we use a baton images to check

00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:54,969
how many images we have right so you

00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:57,039
want to find something we want to do we

00:40:54,969 --> 00:41:05,330
use the darker stuff to start some

00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:08,619
people and they will taste because

00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,619
[Music]

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:17,770
but then if you animus unclutching so

00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:21,670
why are you stubborn because my company

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:30,730
provides us some service right because I

00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:34,690
want to do something not just who we are

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:39,790
imagine that you have a service in your

00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:40,930
company in the incarnation but you have

00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:45,640
a husband

00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:51,970
they want to SS and more money cause you

00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:55,900
do in wrong body situation you will get

00:41:51,970 --> 00:42:00,640
a million new machine you work the point

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:05,760
to listen right and it becomes a gateway

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:08,380
to SS each one egg you think about that

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,870
if you want to provide some activist

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:17,910
Arisa some control service to - SSS SSS

00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:21,490
- you want to use acoustic relationship

00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:24,190
why because the different customer you

00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:27,760
will given different service and it

00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:30,030
report and each time when you credit

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,380
service you will spend for you

00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:35,700
two hours is real if you use this one

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,550
you might we just need to find it

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,730
because you have a one template just

00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:48,590
 just wrong it right that's a

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:48,590
benefit to use that so you're saying

00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:57,290
community hub and Anubis together we can

00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:57,290
use the way

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,650
[Music]

00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:25,089
okay our second ending is how to pray

00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:30,839
your document best to mention we want to

00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:30,839
produce anything

[Music]

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,689

00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,959
the negative effect

00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:25,239
[Music]

00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,940
okay that's it

00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:35,150
let me explain a little so the you up

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:38,200
typing the docker PS I always I always

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:43,029
say it's like the faucet statist

00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:47,079
if you have a docker PS okay

00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:51,799
Tapia's will show what is wrong a

00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:56,299
container now if you know if you try a

00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:59,930
darker PS - eight you will show all

00:44:56,299 --> 00:45:07,150
contain an even trade are not running

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:07,150
they are stop okay so how to stop him

00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:10,699
[Music]

00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:19,230
[Music]

00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,189

[Music]

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:52,040
you started in a very fast right so

00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:55,380
Maurice commander we have some action

00:45:52,040 --> 00:46:00,690
terrible ones for institutions container

00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:04,770
is okay what is that - am I am that

00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:11,550
Thomas remove remove beans if you be

00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:15,510
able to exist container penguin tt8 and

00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:17,730
- I and st that means I will have to put

00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,990
and I have two one I wanna have

00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,870
challenge

00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,770
so imagine end and the one do you want

00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,230
to rescue

00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:32,100
so I ask them to ask you in the pirate

00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:38,390
batch I want to share okay so if you run

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:38,390
it you can see even really you know

00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,110
[Music]

00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:50,050
it was it is Hassan in this title I be

00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,050
here

00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:57,750
when you

00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:15,130
you are seeing every date fashion if you

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,950
want to run attacker to you one attacker

00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:24,100
which the to remove a station I am or

00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:31,450
not if you want to run into 1000 these

00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:34,330
do with the remove or without okay now

00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:41,080
one more is this degree machine is

00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:43,870
shared with your courage or not if the

00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,720
three percent is an escape route machine

00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:49,360
they use the attacker right and all of

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,920
you do some research and get interrupted

00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:58,770
why because you want to have a dinner do

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,770
some do something when you come back

00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,269
continue

00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:07,759
did I do because we don't order the net

00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:12,109
right we are testing we are will not

00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:15,049
order them so for myself if I only want

00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:17,630
to test a permutation I will use the

00:48:15,049 --> 00:48:22,579
destination file I will remove it when I

00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:26,150
disable because we have a keyboard make

00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:29,180
a collet agonize back rise means this

00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:35,829
application in fiscal machine that we do

00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:35,829
it our way so we will keep some testing

00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:43,700
so sometimes I don't want to see when

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,700
you when I get it your machine when I

00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:54,349
call a docker PS or taka PS name there

00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:57,279
will be 20 or 30 stop you do not talk

00:48:54,349 --> 00:49:02,269
including it because you are not sure

00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:06,109
which one of whose methods so for the

00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:11,029
test test perverse I will I will use

00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:13,329
them three move action but please this

00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:13,329
time

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,609
miss Donna how can we stop

00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:44,179
[Music]

00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:54,850
do you see something different if we

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:57,880
don't use the remove but you title

00:49:54,850 --> 00:50:09,160
doctor appears it's 8 you will see

00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:12,010
there's a container that mean what is it

00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:19,630
is a battery to start to breathe

00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:24,070
standing okay but a big one is if you

00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:28,690
don't use the remove and be what I mean

00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:36,190
he will use some storage disk space in

00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:39,730
your machine we just tell anyone the

00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:43,780
darker they shared the same kernel in

00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:46,450
this machine time so basically by

00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:49,039
default the talkers they were used in

00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:52,849
different operating system they will

00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:57,939
red folder if it's a robbery Miney

00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:57,939
Amina's they will use involved library

00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:12,529
but how much if you have a project a to

00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:22,249
team want to manage the doctor you don't

00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:27,799
you know you don't want me to touch we

00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:30,529
can use the 2002 much the same rather in

00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:36,949
this total system over these local

00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:40,369
system so we can knock the rock h be

00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:43,519
bothered to order the formula you want

00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:47,150
to mount so this token for the use of

00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:54,249
will be mount tuna tuna over to the

00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:58,099
folder you order thanks it's great

00:51:54,249 --> 00:52:02,169
so that is what in the name of same as

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,169
we always say they're real mistresses

00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:14,270
company power the storage application

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:16,520
that means what when the server fail it

00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:22,250
doesn't matter because they have still

00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:25,480
exist so the same can use this one and

00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:31,190
the other so we can use the different

00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:34,609
trainers but to mark the same thing that

00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:39,609
means you don't need to worry about this

00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:42,590
container if Trentino diagnose a

00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:47,150
debatable just that just kind of you

00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:50,570
know but you could do the table with the

00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:53,359
craft and you can order the lubrication

00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:55,910
for example ok this container massive as

00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:00,420
reunification that means if this know

00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:01,720
for what service there will be a new one

00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:05,349
[Music]

00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:11,150
and then everything will be the same

00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:14,320
value that's the usage is what you

00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:20,380

00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,710
domain is called information technology

00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:45,220
so we have a co-worker

00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:48,730
we start with some patterns so they have

00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:51,869
a folder for the housing for service

00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:54,700
teaching they do some city information

00:55:51,869 --> 00:55:58,390
so if we have some great weather in the

00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:00,910
university they want to do some for

00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:03,730
example city information they are not an

00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:07,000
IT they don't know they don't know about

00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:09,579
more exciting so they will touch you

00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,640
because they for example there's an open

00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:17,339
source encoder can't get mr. open source

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:20,890
separation velocity but they don't know

00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:25,180
this separation education open-plan of

00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:29,170
this one Civil Code they don't know who

00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:31,319
is the money trail so it's not what we

00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,319
do

00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,160
and they use the physical machinery they

00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:39,610
have an eighth color but I can use that

00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,610
a

to touch the other men I mean easy to

00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,660
teach

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,310
because we want to create an invention

00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:57,460
with purpose right remember remember we

00:57:54,310 --> 00:58:00,310

each one a you know to make some purpose

00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:07,240
or our camera so we can use the remove

00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:11,670
because we were best idea to even do one

00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,670

with the double-wide we started it in

01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:43,070
several time because they do this one to

01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:54,770

01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:16,280
even in a disco machine in the really

image the meet one day in the dead they

01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:04,480
are they use the same common very thing

01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:07,330

knives one is phone which basically two

01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:42,770
three

01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:44,600
what do we want to do this three step is

01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:47,400

[Music]

01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,590
and don't forget okay so we use the

01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:53,159
factor

01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:53,159
[Music]

01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:05,780

01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:26,130
so approach it

01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:30,540
which one would you use to use in a

01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:36,000
conventional use the doctor fire to

01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:39,750
compete in the convention I think the

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,990
best policies you should use the puzzle

01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:46,430
parties is easy to share and everyone

01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:46,430

01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:56,540
the final net okay so how do we to

you was needed properly major IDs

01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:15,010
if you try to use that

01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:21,600
[Music]

01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:37,040

01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:19,840

[Music]

01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,070
[Music]

01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:09,870

use Stone Edge they say the container is

01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:18,570
to use the invention to copy to the

01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:24,729
