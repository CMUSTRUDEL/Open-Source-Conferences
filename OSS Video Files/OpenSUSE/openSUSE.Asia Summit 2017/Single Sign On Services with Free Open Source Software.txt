we're sorry to keep you waiting session

00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:19,460
vegetation seeing single sign-on

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,460
satisfied with free open source software

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:31,039
testing she and she thoroughly studied

00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,039
Tony and the solution

00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,740
[Music]

00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,740
[Applause]

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,000
the day for musician and this is the

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,480
second time I come to an open source

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,780
program the first time was in in my

00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:01,910
university instead of Indonesia I was

00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:01,910
one of the collaborator for the with no

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,990
it's really convert to Kentucky this

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:14,430
afternoon

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:17,040
thanks to open to say ok Allison I want

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,930
to share knowledge standing it's an art

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm experiencing how to be stable and

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,920
also faced with free open source

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,619
software I do maybe some of you are

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,470
using this kind of cases where we know

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,650
like Java pal there's a condom single

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,850
sign-on services also an education we

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:55,229
get the generator

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:59,500
in Rome that's yet understanding

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:03,610
services and security aspect also I want

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,780
to step how we follow or we deploy our

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:11,740
services at my university Tunisia and

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,720
also this is my startup and maybe

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:22,770
something we not couple of beers are

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:26,950
very good topics and 15 a time with me I

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,790
will set up something I got another

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,570
chance for our conference so this is me

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,220
I'm a system engineer at the Indonesia

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,830
so now I'm going to change network

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:44,010
administrator and also until for our

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:50,019
national open source repository or

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:57,030
convene the pinyin is a goat but this is

00:02:50,019 --> 00:03:01,150
the limit on the go with this year

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:04,090
convene University of Indonesia so after

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,390
a lecture at each that my faculty of

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,900
computer science my subject was my such

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:13,180
it is comprised of distributed system

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,430
system programming and open source often

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,390
the government and I also the astara

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,599
quality bar

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,810
I'm on the off-chip there from 2015

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,780
until now we focusing on IOT platform

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:38,890
and it helped through our Omni channel

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:42,519
system a little nothing to me so the

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:48,090
first chapter is the understanding

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:48,090
chemical and it security aspect in the

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:56,230
you know the cigarette it's all access

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,930
all surfaces acuteness user login into

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,269
one application and then signing into

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,030
another application automatically

00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:07,620
because of the technology or domain

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:11,650
where pieces that came from this trust

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:16,269
our team one party as the identity

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,940
provider and the party also provide two

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,889
encryption for the identity channel up

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,610
to the communication between your ass

00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:28,419
and the strategies on the Front Range no

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:30,460
sign out if they are welcome from one

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:35,380
application then everything on the level

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,770
when we conversely 1vc example when you

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:41,880
look at the world us

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,880
[Music]

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,900
[Music]

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:52,030
this is a single channel go the

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,800
hostesses recollection input on cetera

00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:02,950
party mission here will provide all the

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:06,250
presence here then this identity

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,940
provider the identity provider is a

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:13,530
party or software system you must trust

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,530
even though this is me

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,530
like when the ratification but something

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:27,170
but some bank also handle the aggression

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:33,840
and how we be on 3po a precision

00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:36,330
auditing and modification so also we

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,030
have the requesting apps as the consumer

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,840
front of the entity provider so this

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,940
user will DRAM access right to be an

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,330
entity profile in the end the resting

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:59,490
act will ask the credential romney and

00:05:48,330 --> 00:06:02,280
then give reminder so inflow is user

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:06,810
access an app protected like a chaser

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:13,170
system this act and then it could be

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:15,540
directed back and to treat see the apps

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:20,430
will get back to the identity provider

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:26,280
side user access the other side then he

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:32,010
or she entered the condenser is a and

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:34,320
like actual user name may be other the

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,850
90-second deep user access right and

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,220
several attributecore application access

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,470
then we shall strike into the app with

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,100
fish or access right in the attributes

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,670
we said the the calm cloth of single

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,310
sign-on systems so up on the back end

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,160
the IDP is the middle component of SSL

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:59,040
system it can store and retrieve

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,130
division and also access a tribute from

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,919
multiple

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:12,110
we pen is a directory services on the l

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:15,090
dfp open a leading example Oh victory so

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,840
you can also stop the video on SQL

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,960
database and maybe you can use external

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,490
service provider with some protocol

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:30,540
enforces go out or maybe a sam'l SPL

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:34,020
meter service provider of the town of an

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,710
IE or redefine what such cases you can

00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:41,780
find around that services we can use

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,780
Wendy 19 the ability provider

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:52,860
it's two TS back we by implanting access

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:56,610
though we expect the products of the SSL

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,740
for internal SATA on the application as

00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:04,050
long as we never used SSL for the

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:07,169
competition so we don't give yet direct

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,130
access to the conventional database but

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:16,139
the SSL services will become the proxy

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:19,289
for the ask to access to prevention and

00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,570
also give right from the app which can

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:25,110
be used or you know what which cannot be

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:29,970
use so as I self-identification station

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:33,900
link so if we handle authentication

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:37,409
correct acts may be there if you're not

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,360
securing your apps correctly someone

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,300
injected your ass and their stolen

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,520
credentials so I set off a little

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,880
sensation in late because I will be your

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:51,650
advocate season access all imperfect new

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,650
confidence alpha of n watterson

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,800
this is this are from free and open

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:08,340
source software XSL fermentation I have

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:12,430
tried to from these the first one is

00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:19,150
operating on just adjust on the Jesse

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:20,920
Jesse Jesse or jump ionization special

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,220
interest in this group is from

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,000
University we are really Center and they

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:40,300
are so making spectacle contest Center

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:43,540
our biggest centerpieces and this is

00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:47,460
only Hydra this new one we use a tap-in

00:09:43,540 --> 00:10:03,370
par self-actualization - fine hello

00:09:47,460 --> 00:10:05,350
so as people and I think also the then

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:11,920
are we so - which is closer and the

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:14,380
edited suffer me to miss our South

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,370
implementation of the singles and all

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:24,480
surface you can deploy and we set this

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:28,030
party but my top we will share my

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:42,760
experience when you deploy which to the

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:47,310
jessica's okay single sign up that we

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,310
need to be nice here oh I

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,120
this is these are some profile of my

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,020
university we one of the oldest state

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,020
all university

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,330
[Music]

00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,200
[Music]

00:11:25,850 --> 00:12:39,120
and so we have we have all surfaces

00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:40,860
yeah so we have classification systems

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,660
to the new learning system our

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,480
infrastructure here we build our routers

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:51,860
must be from the open source and

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:56,089
by 31 we wait we therefore the

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,070
PowerShell so the single sign-on service

00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,110
also the montage

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,529
we believe that collaborative work on

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,589
postpartum you think compare net costs

00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:08,839
purpose is to think Oh system even this

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:11,000
lead on our any very strong there is

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:19,910
something we sometimes we have to

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:22,399
question the distinction from president

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:30,380
and we also we are making one of

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:36,620
national research at the okay this is

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:39,260
our single sign-on system so i we you

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,029
start to use open LVDS credential

00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,350
provider of our students and stop at

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,300
least in the public to doctors so

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:51,170
aspiring at single how worth of

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:58,040
application general so every faculty to

00:13:51,170 --> 00:14:00,850
make their own system we supported must

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,360
really need so the meaning must

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,550
automatically to the problem after s

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,300
have to build an animal to fit on the

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,740
receiver Oscar yourself please every

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:22,819
personal family 2012 so I started in

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:25,010
2011 I involved in the weather based on

00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:27,230
the development so I inherited

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:31,759
development from my pro 50

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:35,689
so we're falling solution worth asking

00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,369
when the many apps you can is a

00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:42,119
publication a common multiplication

00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:49,919
platform of the end we employ singles

00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:54,109
and on surface on SSL we fix you see

00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:56,369
majestic task before a different one so

00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:57,779
also provide you with customer support

00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:00,389
it is important also

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:05,569
you can expand it for dog but we

00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:08,519
customize the customization result and

00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:17,819
at the first time we are using open

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:21,349
elder there's your source then between

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:26,879
this year we are rated to just adjust

00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:30,119
325 X and during this time what we use

00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,949
on Ewing apps and processor such as

00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:34,159
internet access our scholarship

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:41,959
application system Juno access proxy

00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:59,309
even to so the campus want to buy some

00:15:41,959 --> 00:16:02,839
yeah yeah so the second we have with

00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:02,839
several hundred authentication

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:17,419
[Music]

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,540
[Music]

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:42,030
this account was not accessing me l dat

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:47,850
but producing on HP or the Commission we

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:56,230
happy drupal source the Drupal database

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:58,060
or our and we also develop develop

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,950
additional will give that people

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:07,000
provider based on the respects at least

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:11,980
why some system making it more absolute

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,310
nor a treatment can give my suppressed

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,490
maybe the application system it will

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:25,089
really it will ask us to the payment

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:27,760
status so the other they don't have we

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:33,820
have develop additional experts which

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:36,430
asked me just back and we are planning

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:41,620
on it mechanical cooling and are there

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:44,830
to just 5 X Y because there's more

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,430
information on satisfied to be

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:52,150
especially to be extra faces and also

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:55,110
testified support for out opportunities

00:17:52,150 --> 00:18:01,649
here we just remove four five

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:10,590
lovely quite unlike the salmon and also

00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:26,429
our see what we see our spectrum a state

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:29,789
vector or now the productions so if you

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:34,260
put too many attribute to me there will

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:40,139
be people to the top I expected in some

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:43,309
of memory related and meaning of us to

00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:51,510
memory you get to decide for you will

00:18:43,309 --> 00:19:13,049
make no sense because we consume Java C

00:18:51,510 --> 00:19:19,019
and Java second but the for the

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:25,620
yes Miss Jessica or efficiency are aware

00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:28,380
the account come from the power so we

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,659
also this built out of a custom

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,230
recreational fish for the surface is

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:36,769
methane which is the middle that it's

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,659
going to many system and get the

00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:42,659
appropriate attribute warning bursting

00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:45,889
asks why so afternoon in depth a trainee

00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,889
with checking hospital

00:19:47,860 --> 00:20:01,580
cannot be given through elder this is

00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:06,500
how we deploy so the customer is a jab

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:08,620
pyar is use stream stream framework so

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:14,570
you have to compile it by a tap away

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:19,480
using methanol griddle it will be

00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:23,840
started on our 112 what were you put in

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:27,380
so you will need an SQL database also

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:31,010
but this is not for authentication

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,590
angular or teacher chemistry the other

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:37,669
bodies to pick it pick up like a three I

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,640
don't know it's like just I already

00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:44,150
provide storage from the bigger players

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,990
peanuts by using Apple STRs we're using

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:52,130
an in-memory database because we don't

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:54,740
have to store the tickets always so

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,870
maybe we need to track them for at least

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:12,500
one date and you can drop the ticket

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:21,169
always in the clean speed and be on form

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:28,100
or work properly and this configuration

00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:36,039
file for the database is connected any

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:41,510
other profile we're gonna show you the

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:44,330
qualities but no at least we also in

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:48,660
disturbing apps the app we used the

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:54,340
receptor Jasper

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:58,000
and at least the last time the last

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,220
party the security oh yes the

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,240
transaction must be secured in ticket

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:10,570
part exchange in the new system must be

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:21,480
first - yes I deploy in front of my

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:25,360
contract adjustment we just wrote a poem

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,730
that is HTTP based authentication and

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,810
communication protocol based on the

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:37,290
ticketing mechanism so when we use just

00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:39,970
to steal in your login so it will from

00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,890
some tickets just import in a

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,440
two-component application and first

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,090
intercept are you deploy alongside the

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,900
success relation yes you just attach

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:52,990
this answer and we understand you must

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,990
included the client or embedded the code

00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,150
within your application from the test

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,810
client is there's a lot of information

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,580
you can find huh it's a spiral

00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:07,380
additional make up in most programming

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:13,630
language are founded upon Python php.net

00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:17,980
and and this is the ticket which takes

00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:22,590
between the tasks star for any app first

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,890
when you login it's a limited global

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:42,550
season ticket for the TGT

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:49,440
ticket granting ticket mission pocket

00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:52,960
you can play all the games on the bar

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,970
the first set of TDT like that it's the

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,600
master ticket generated by each task and

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:04,490
this is perfect

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,680
so in new the TTB

00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:11,590
will generate a service ticket per

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:14,750
application who used the same credential

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:17,330
so I Steve sophisticated targeted some

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,600
detrimental new and Alex can cut the

00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,460
excess with my adjuster to the justified

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,080
you mean the cashback application in

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:33,350
education varying well the coke from

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:34,360
unit test client non-aligned ring which

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,610
is a skin

00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:45,430
there are several based on the transport

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:48,610
of all this our first access for the gap

00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:51,440
when you use the touchpad application

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:59,180
the application will be directly to the

00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:02,630
server and just were presented with a

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,890
login form if you enter the correct code

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,880
else here it will generate a PvP ticket

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,910
vending there

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,900
then the ticket ticket will generate a

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:18,400
certificate only of the easier the

00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:23,890
surface ticket and then come to the user

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:28,070
scholarship eg valid SOS me mr. O'Mara

00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:32,330
so we serve your yellow is session and

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:37,370
access to the F the first access and in

00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:41,630
the second one five minutes second

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:44,210
access to the same obligation you don't

00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,120
presented the transistor we go to send

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:55,420
the send the application login forms

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:55,420
that you will need to be directed us

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:08,080
it's a demo so this is a Google Apps and

00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,410
they connected to be our ministry that's

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:33,190
it if the Google app requests our sample

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:36,280
to our Google Apps then if another

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:38,200
application you see this is our project

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,410
when it is medical column using wrecked

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,410
mine

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:54,180
yeah I'm looking there so this is the

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:57,900
second access the sophistic get consumed

00:26:54,180 --> 00:27:01,760
by direct mind and we Google Google the

00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:07,650
custard apple ticket via tamil kanakam

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,780
if I love what in here oh sorry did

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,660
people it's not equal at the singles and

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:22,320
out well there's some application the

00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:26,100
replication and yeah this is how are you

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,980
register so quickly just just to pull a

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,510
this receptor here my wish so basically

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,180
your initial entry services and a space

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:39,690
fight well good can be consumed by the

00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,930
yeah so as maybe you can give the user

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:49,340
name and email address or phone number

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:52,370
or maybe student status students papers

00:27:49,340 --> 00:28:06,500
some example an active student or

00:27:52,370 --> 00:28:06,500
student be academic or the second one is

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:16,620
yeah we developing us I'm developing a

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:23,930
small community that we focus on peyote

00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:29,790
surfaces on the channel engine and also

00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:34,410
some federated login or the DC the Hydra

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:38,040
this is access closer fist but is using

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:44,940
an OAuth protocol protocol of the

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:48,510
ARPANET slogan so in this system we

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:53,280
built the constant hats because the

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:54,450
Hydra do not provide you with from Logan

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,090
and how to

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,340
authentication Hydra escalate provide

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:07,290
you with the organization because it's

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:09,420
old profile some tutorial deal

00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,660
particularly in the table which the

00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:16,670
receptor and we get to compile the

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:20,330
source or in hi directly on the Brisbane

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:23,760
go-between VD migration on the Hydra and

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:26,940
also for specifying systems it will

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,720
generate your whole properties I mean

00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,870
first off line and all tricycle so if

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,420
you take the hydrogen bomb it will be

00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:39,930
used on the surfer style also we need to

00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:47,360
deploy our same access also fishes in

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:47,360
front of Hydra this is the header client

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:56,520
def of the file sorry you must French

00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:00,720
Italian and it will set up your first

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:05,010
all file over to management management

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:09,810
of creating and destroying act with the

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:18,540
hydrogen Jason what button to sign the

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:21,870
request the user agent called the China

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:25,200
and acquire a pond behind the innocent

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:29,000
with me authentication the operation

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,710
table and the representing

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,710
I'd rather detective to there comes an

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:46,590
applicant and the need authentication

00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:49,380
and return it to Hydra you copy because

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:53,070
the trick is community growth I cannot

00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:55,720
give all the detail so many if I have

00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:00,620
another channel

00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,870
yeah I will set up a workshop I'm

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,630
telling you what the Jessica's already

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,580
Hydra with garbage Feynman also enemy

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,280
and removing mechanism fix for after the

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:25,520
beautiful easier and a little bit which

00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:29,450
does an identification if you have any

00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:33,850
question you can contact information

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,850
please ask him okay okay

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,280
