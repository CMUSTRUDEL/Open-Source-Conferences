	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,200
good evening by the me don't be had and

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:11,099
I'm from Korea and I'm also leader of

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,259
good to career company so I just want to

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:19,109
talk about how you might get connected

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:22,410
in ways many companies today which is

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:27,920
iced tea and therefore channel and

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:33,149
communication but I think I see in

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:38,790
traditional and you community with

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:44,160
everything or we also have two channels

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:50,360
the also is GSA but that's a problems

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,360
with the open sleigh maybe four

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,399
different channel for typically train

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,070
and I see cannot communicate each other

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,700
they want to someone in IT want to

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,770
communicate with people in say digital

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,880
join the same you cannot communicate

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,909
from the IC so also you feel your

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,520
everything today we can all story

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:26,869
ot story no no song if you're to see the

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:34,640
old history we should pay for you to see

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:34,640
also safety fail to virtually to

00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:42,270
participate in both you need to join in

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,520
both and second I see me too Jake was

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:48,229
too funky so it can be a big complex

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,939
family that's all it's a party channel

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,939
you can different information we can

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,630
water information share only in one

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,490
channel

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,130
so we also have some simple purpose and

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:08,030
intent because it was Facebook group and

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:12,350
forum and in testing the usual eNOS form

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:16,910
the site to change the change like

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:20,360
changing of opinion but we now they use

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:23,480
Facebook much work so we have some

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,790
problem and make authority take Facebook

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,510
what's more so people so you can t to

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:38,590
interpret most channels but we shouldn't

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:43,250
today that is way different but you can

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,940
but I thought he is possible to predict

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:57,470
to channel second ilg so to protect

00:02:46,940 --> 00:03:01,220
connect to channel we after that we do

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,489
we do research before is refunds from

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,670
good to check on me and I found it there

00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:13,880
were using same room which is published

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:19,310
to connect some messenger it was easy to

00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:23,600
use what is painting spectacle community

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:28,820
need to pay for every month and it's not

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:34,310
so it is not sustainable good on paper

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:37,609
it it should be is connecting so we

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:41,030
should be some other research and you

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:45,019
found that you will complete form

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:49,730
provide free virtual machine and for my

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:53,890
browser or fee you deploy on either a

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:57,850
state vision so we decide to use today

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:01,820
is actually the cheapest one in the

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,330
platform and it's very fun what one

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,140
means

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,900
also some we also use keys and just for

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,830
this popcorn to deploy because I came

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,170
it's all it takes so much of that so

00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:21,020
this is how you look how with this in

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:26,730

my community here I'm going to show you

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:06,640
how you can create a prosperous virtual

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,220
reality I don't know if anyone have

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,370
expressed about me yeah even though

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:28,300
there's a vinyasa Institute maybe you

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:30,760
can get me to achieve devices like I

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,250
wanted to create a fun experience we

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,820
choose what VR which is technology

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:39,280
created by browser vendors like we go

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,710
Mozilla etc the priests voice that your

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,310
browser get information from the device

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:51,430
and permission to transfer so you can

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:57,270
control ah today almost all the big

00:06:51,430 --> 00:07:00,220
prayers or going to support we are

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,820
pharmacy but still there's a big problem

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,770
for web developer like me creative 3d

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,530
scenes is there to be hard for work -

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,730
maybe like me you have to control this

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:16,750
that in 2d in Melbourne just like a

00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,890
camera like Mordor material etc etc and

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,000
a few others

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,660
finally boom you've gotta acute charity

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,840
of three hours

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,770
that's tomorrow boss but you stay but

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,790
don't worry

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:34,120
just like everything on the web if death

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:39,370
companies start on web user

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:42,280
so here's our main character Aaron it's

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,919
a we our framework created by New Deal

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,320
of apron is pretty straightforward for

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,000
what developers you have cake you know

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,600
define attributions and ain't some

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,320
squeak lingo down so here are some

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,270
Eugene helmets you can use my way I only

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:06,070
have two minutes remain so let's get

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:09,970
electable okay here I have already L

00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:15,120
found best thin steaks on the screen and

00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:15,120
now let's make some nice big one

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:29,970
whenever I need a spy a steady state you

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:36,240
can benefit us so we can create 316

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,240
photo viewer in this case

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,850
[Music]

00:08:45,060 --> 00:09:29,350
okay so we have and then let's enforce

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:32,110
on Island we have a Island Iced order

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:40,240
and iron order fathers but if you can

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:42,370
create a Pseudomonas even do it okay how

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,920
we have a long time since we are

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,920
entertainers by someone famous here

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,070
maybe we don't marry

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:18,540
okay if we want to modify the position

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:20,520
you can use the building inspector which

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:27,600
is actually pretty similar like the

00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:30,090
unity so that's how you can create and

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,210
VI versus infinite so if you want to

00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:46,130
know more just check apron paper the

00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:46,130
aisle people are extant in some of the

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,419

listen you see this is very this is

00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:49,669
developed and in my education system

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:54,029
contain doctor isn't in an application

00:19:49,669 --> 00:20:03,360
continuing training the SD or HD and

00:19:54,029 --> 00:20:07,750
reuse having a process in so you can use

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:17,179
system CDL or service common

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:24,500
activists and services under the any

process like continent possible FC first

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:36,460
in developed and the LCD and the a

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,460
speeches you can use an open City

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:52,070
perceive I see police to FC and he's

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:56,389
restored and music prescribed and steps

00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:00,710
for registration nothing there there are

00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:04,460
more intense peaches or content

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:11,750
management prescribed and the transition

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:16,130
is so easy for you and make XE container

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:21,649
they can run yes

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:24,980
or some buckets vision WordPress post

00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:30,169
and again every container but usually

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,679
button I guess you want to use okay

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,679

you can use it content in LC e or FC

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:06,820
next to the container which is the can

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:22,820
then containers in merci Oh L see

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:26,630
yeah and no need to compete each other

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:33,760
badly they're complementary functions

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:33,760
