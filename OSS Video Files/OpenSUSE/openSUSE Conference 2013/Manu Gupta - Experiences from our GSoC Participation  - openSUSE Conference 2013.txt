Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	We will be discussing our GSoC Experiences over the past 3 years, show where we failed and where we succeeded. We will also discuss the challenges that lie ahead for future successful GSoC participants. We will discuss the both a mentor's and student's perspective and some statistics that give a good overview of where we are today.

and now Manu and see but sorrow okay our

00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:20,340
experience from our google Summer of

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:24,050
Code participation hello everyone should

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,230
we wait like or should we just start

00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:35,969
okay good start is good okay oh I just

unlock so I'm Manu I've been G socks to

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,879
google Summer of Code student from in

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,860
2011 and sorrow has been a g-shock

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,510
student google Summer of Code student in

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,640
this one live 12 right so what we will

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,539
do over here is will tell what google

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,860
summer of code is about from a student's

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,039
point of view how to write a good

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,719
proposal when to start and how is it

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,489
good for a student then we will go on

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,700
how to become a mentor in a google

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,320
summer of code project because this year

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,330
we have been organizing it in the

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,040
previous year we had once and tons and

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,100
not doing it for us and the last part i

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,810
prefer it should be an open post mortem

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,500
discussion on what we have been doing

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,220
the good the bad and the ugly of the

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,920
presentation okay so i'll leave it to

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:38,280
sort of to start up hi everyone I'm

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,540
sarem and by show of hands how many can

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,759
I know how many of you are actually

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,350
familiar with the summer of code by show

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,500
of hands Oh heard of it or participated

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:55,110
forever gay the signs so their money

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:59,909
will don't know so who does not know

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:02,340
sell us okay so I see anyone so I just

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,710
be brief about it so it's a sort of an

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,479
internship program for students enrolled

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,760
in a university it's Google Forms

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,680
organizations participating

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,310
organizations they form a list of

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,790
projects

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,400
and which they won't work to be done on

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,239
and students are enrolled in those

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,500
projects and they basically participate

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,480
in open source projects just talk plus

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,959
if you want to ask a question it's

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,400
better if it goes that way because you

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,819
two guys are new to google Summer of

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,830
Code and I presumably I assume that you

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:45,480
love coding and you want to get into it

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:48,930
right so ask us questions that is the

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,120
way it should be it may we may we might

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,980
not finish our presentation but if we

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,530
get more students it's always good right

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,959
that's fine so I just brief you through

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,370
the go solar program it's to highlight

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
the open-source culture among students

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,599
and oh just one thing just stop me if

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,260
I'm speaking too fast because as Costa

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,380
said that I speak too fast so it

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,299
basically what i feel is it went in it's

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,000
a it's an excellent introduction to

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:21,239
people who are interested in developing

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,100
real applications but need need a lot of

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,140
guidance so mentoring is a very

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:30,299
important factor in the google summer of

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,280
code so it the best part what I failed

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,109
is a lot of code gets created and

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,090
integrated into the existing code base

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:40,980
of gets integrated into the existing

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,900
code base of the community so that's

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,590
what I feel is a very important part of

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,109
the google Summer of Code and this is

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,609
for the students a very handsome stipend

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:55,739
that is five thousand USD that's

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:57,510
probably a lot so I will just be walking

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,799
through the history it started in 2005

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,650
and some almost seven years since since

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,880
it started way into the eighth here and

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,150
opensuse has a very long history the

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,100
summer of code we started in 2006 and

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,470
that there was Justin in 2010 we did not

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,459
participate and so far has been an

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,560
awesome experience and we have a very

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,440
good success to failure ratio and the

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,240
stats are like this like 2013 they still

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,250
pending is to be still pahlavi are

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,710
participating in 2013 and

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,760
so far we are hoping to have a lot of

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:37,000
have a very good success ratio and so

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,640
the program works like this so in the

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,370
beginning we the organization's they

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,620
apply to google and they submit a

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,690
proposal of whatever water what they

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,820
want to do with the project with what

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,980
they want what all sorts of water

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,970
sub-projects they want to accomplish

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,620
during the year and Google finally

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,010
accepts those organizations is the field

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,510
are sort of worthy i can say to

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,510
participate in the summer of code and

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,820
then the mentoring again this time

00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,470
around 177 organizations are

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:20,350
participating and great we are one of

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:22,540
them okay can I ask you ask you okay you

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,250
guys are students were it so can you do

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,020
computer science or any other stream

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,900
right can I ask you a question what do

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:39,250
you like doing like if you are asked to

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:42,220
write a program what would you do if are

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:46,720
going to write the program whole thing

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,750
what what to do to what program so maybe

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,540
you can make a website maybe write an

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,000
Android application may be right huge

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,340
algorithms maybe just create another see

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,220
library just write a driver so what

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:05,140
would you like to do like it's just I'm

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:08,560
just curious to know oh because once now

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:11,290
when we get here or what I really want

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,979
is you actually know how to choose your

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:17,650
projects what you like to do and then go

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,810
forward and because that's what

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,120
basically we did and that's what most

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,800
successful getting into google summer of

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:32,770
code is not difficult but that is what

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:37,539
we need to understand basically so when

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,340
we so that is my question maybe not the

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,630
web said something like a program maybe

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,350
a non doing now

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:48,139
exactly so I'll just go to the previous

00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:51,320
slide where we have 180 organizations

00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:53,630
coming up right so what happens is 18

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,139
every organization has at least three

00:06:53,630 --> 00:07:02,509
projects on an average at least see

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:05,750
projects there are projects over hundred

00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:12,259
over fifteen some organizations so 3

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:15,289
into 1 80 is a lot ok 3 into 1 80 is a

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:17,600
lot and you have anything and everything

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,760
to choose from it can be hard where it

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:24,680
can be real software can be Colonels it

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,169
can be everything so the choice is never

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,440
a problem with google Summer of Code

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:38,419
it's usually choosing the right project

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:41,389
right mentor not as the problem I guess

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:44,870
everyone here is eligible except for

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:49,400
school students or school students there

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,930
is a separate program which may or may

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,380
not be announced is here by Google after

00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:00,710
that you can be anything your bachelor's

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:05,300
in literature google does not care we do

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:08,949
not care open source does not care you

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:13,880
might be doing your doctorate right so

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:16,190
you can easily be from whatever field

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,320
you are it's just that you need to write

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,330
some Union you need to have some basic

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,099
skills of code if you can write hash

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,770
include hello world and maybe convince

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:27,590
you mate mentor dad by the time you end

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:34,760
your project you can write some C

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:38,270
library great some sorry some students

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:43,159
are not liked by US government some

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:45,950
cannot people from Israel and Iraq Iran

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:49,300
I think cannot participate in google

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:52,550
summer of code that is because of US law

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,750
nothing against us but that is because

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:58,940
the rules say so

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,390
okay this is probably the most important

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:07,210
part of this to further students when

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:10,700
does google summer of code starts and

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:16,510
this is it it starts from around March

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:20,210
and ends by a sep tember we submit our

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,910
applications basically organizations

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,150
submit their ideas to google and google

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,780
says okay will do but the more important

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,660
part is finding out a project from

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,590
previous year projects basically many

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,110
students start from January onwards so

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:43,130
it's finding out a project of your

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,230
choice and then trying to sync it up

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:49,970
when google announces the final list of

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:52,760
projects to get through so this is some

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,640
only one-third of the original ideas get

00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,340
through so you might not be lucky that

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,720
you have an excellent proposal but then

00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,450
you don't get in because the

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,160
organization think so something better

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,980
there was something better in some other

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,860
project but that's not the thing to

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,010
worry about you can still contribute the

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,780
rat is the idea right huh it's also the

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,270
money but the main idea is to get

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,850
involved you in open source and that is

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,810
why we are here so if your idea does not

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,610
get selected and if you try this year

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,530
submit your prop you keep on working

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,410
without maybe next year the organization

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,150
will think okay this guy is great this

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,400
idea is not that great but we'll take

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,740
this guy because his work thought so for

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:45,560
the last year we that has happened in

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,660
the past and people do that so by a you

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,980
should start by january i believe look

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:55,340
at old organ old organizations popular i

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:59,440
talked to the mentors submit code or get

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:03,470
to know everything look at old ideas

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,470
then submit code once you you need to

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,360
write a proposal also that is a

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,089
requirement

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,600
and a good proposal is almost everything

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:17,389
because mentors do not know you we work

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,389
around suppose I'm in Delhi and you're

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:23,389
in Salonika said it doesn't work that

00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:27,290
way so to have a very good proposal is a

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:29,389
must by the end of May we start our

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:35,209
coding period for the next three months

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:39,410
you could ok we have a first set of

00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:43,449
evaluations this by the end of this

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:46,999
month I believe in two weeks july and

00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:48,920
after that after one month we start

00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:52,069
documenting our code for the last two

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,079
weeks and pencil down as the

00:11:52,069 --> 00:12:00,920
documentation because documentation is

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:04,519
as important as other stuff right the

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,290
then it's the mentors who may want to

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,519
attend the mentor summit at Google

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,529
California Google headquarters after

00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,470
that keep on contributing code basically

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,360
this is a timeline on how to apply

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,819
something which saw a little better

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,750
because he was here last year and has a

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:26,990
much more fresh experience I guess so

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,319
what I feel is when you're when you feel

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,579
like applying to and the google Summer

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:34,459
of Code the best thing would be to

00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:39,259
identify the organization which you will

00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:41,300
like to work on so for me it was not a

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,670
very natural choice for opensuse because

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:49,040
I was initially working for KDE for some

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:50,480
time and then somehow I was I was also

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,189
using open suse at that time so I

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
basically got interested into two

00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:59,720
projects and applied for both of them so

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,029
it was some I was as slightly lucky to

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,360
get into the open source a project and i

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:10,069
can say i think it was quite nice that i

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,889
got into it so what i feel is a what i

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,749
would suggest is to work to select a

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,160
project or something select the

00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:17,750
organization that you are already using

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,259
or something like the like the

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,209
distribution you're using or

00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,129
some software that you're using and you

00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:26,739
actually can relate to something that

00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:29,769
you can relate to so and the best thing

00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:31,299
would be to start early so because that

00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,279
all that makes a lot of difference and

00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:34,779
you can actually learn learn a lot of

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,639
the existing code base if there is any

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:41,410
and get technically sound while

00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,129
submitting your proposal so that is

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,769
probably very important and go through

00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:49,239
last year's projects like if the

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:51,249
organization has previously participated

00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:53,470
then it'll be a very good idea to know

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:57,189
what with in which direction the project

00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,089
is headed towards so then choose your

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:03,609
projects as I said based on your

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:07,269
discretion then contribute code that

00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:09,579
most people this was heard in my

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:13,329
experience is they write the proposal

00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:15,639
but they do not try to contribute code

00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:18,279
or even though it's not a prerequisite

00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:20,139
but it's always suggested that you write

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,350
some code and get familiarized with the

00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:27,220
existing code base so it's quite

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,439
important and as many said the proposal

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,629
is almost everything it tells you with

00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:34,179
how familiar you are with the project

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,689
and whether your technical skills are up

00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:39,129
to the mark or not so be in touch with

00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,069
your mentor that is also one very

00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,939
important aspect like key community

00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:46,149
communicating with your mentor if you

00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:49,059
are able to keep up with the project or

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,399
if you are having some confusions or

00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,069
something they are very easily clarified

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,739
and mentors are great people so just

00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:58,569
keep on interacting with them I think

00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:03,220
man who can attest to that that enters a

00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:05,769
great and awesome people so flip bits

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,779
not burgers that's actually we borrowed

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:09,399
this from google they actually right

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:11,559
there whenever they go and present the

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,779
google Summer of Code they always right

00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:16,799
flip bits not burgers so I personally

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:25,059
find that in that an amazing statement

00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:27,789
so these are a few questions we have

00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:32,619
been asked a lot of time can I get in am

00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:34,529
I good and off should I try or should I

00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:39,369
not try

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:43,869
so these are some questions okay but I

00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:46,059
am NOT a great coder so what so first

00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:49,419
I'll try to ask can I get in yes you can

00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:51,669
simple you can everyone can get in just

00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,039
a cheap need to be eligible for it you

00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:56,019
know no you need to be over 18 and you

00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,589
should be studying in any school or

00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:03,970
university second thing is if I can get

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:08,319
in I am not that great kudo there are

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,919
easy projects google specifically makes

00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:15,159
sure a good percentage of your projects

00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,959
or are for new contributors they do make

00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:20,739
sure they do have this at the back of

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,049
their mind they'll tell okay this is

00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:24,879
what we should do and we'll have some

00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,279
easier projects for new contributors

00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,829
we'll have some very difficult projects

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,529
also people who are much more into now

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,949
you cannot expect a doctorate from CS to

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:38,349
work on a very easy project right that's

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:41,229
how it is so Google has from labeled

00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:44,379
zero to level 10 everything and it

00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:46,299
actually chooses an organization if an

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,829
organization actually categorizes all

00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:54,009
the projects by the level of their

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:57,189
difficulty okay what do we okay I'll get

00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:59,919
to this later and let's get to a Q&A

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:01,629
round basically asked questions I am

00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:05,379
sure you should have questions by now

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:08,189
it's been is being fast I believe not

00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:12,089
even 10 minutes without of information

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:12,089
but questions

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,919
so how do we get in touch with mendel

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:23,069
sure she'd abroad section excellent

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,439
vision I miss that sorry about it I just

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,730
add in my slides later okay to get in

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,950
touch every organization usually has an

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,309
idea page which you can simply google

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:41,700
out i'll show will just google it out

00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:46,169
for you offer so open so they do sock

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:50,279
ideas if you just type this the first

00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:52,950
page is the ideas phase right so

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:57,860
basically it's easy right now when you

00:17:52,950 --> 00:18:04,080
click on ideas page when we go down we

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:10,230
see a lot of ideas oh you'll see one

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:12,090
idea if you look carefully this is an

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,870
this is a current google summer of code

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:23,669
project the mentor is dinner and you can

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:26,100
actually email him oh this is one of the

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,580
you can just email him so usually

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:32,070
organizations do try to have a contact

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:35,789
point with the mentor and you can email

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,559
him you can talk on the IRC channels for

00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,139
us it is the open source project or

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,629
opensuse factory for build service it is

00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:44,909
always the open will service you can go

00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:47,720
on opensuse factory or you can try out

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:50,129
the mailing lists but it's not easy

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,409
getting in touch with the mentor for the

00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,750
first time it's not easy you just need

00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:59,909
to find your way around and get to know

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:02,639
the easiest way possible so no this is

00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:08,309
something there's something we should

00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:13,710
add in the slides too we also recommend

00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:17,220
IRC or mailing lists if someone does not

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,129
respond you can always like okay you can

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,330
tell the admins or maybe they will try

00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:28,110
contacting them and if if things do not

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,590
work out well before google Summer of

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,950
Code

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:34,169
starts we what we usually try to do will

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,320
just eliminate the project but if it

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:39,630
starts again if during the period of

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:42,630
google Summer of Code we try to find an

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,480
alternative mentor and who will try and

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:50,130
help you out so that's how it works

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,200
basically so if things do not work out

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,150
with your mentor we are always there the

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,020
admins are always there it did happen

00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,990
during this time or one of the mentors

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:06,029
was on a vacation and a student got

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:10,679
really worried so we spoke to the mentor

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:12,899
on and then he said okay but then that

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,799
this does applies to students also

00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:19,500
students should not disappear either

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:23,039
right so it is a problem for mentor it

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,399
is a more problem mentors do it on do it

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,110
voluntarily one voluntarily so it's a

00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:29,460
big problem for mentors because they are

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,279
expecting something they're expecting

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,260
code out of the students because you are

00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,240
being paid one thing the other thing is

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,130
they actually want the project to be

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:45,539
realized which is even more important

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:50,490
thing so if a student gets i have seen

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:51,779
one organization they really because we

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,100
are participating with four

00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:58,559
organizations this year so i have seen

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,710
one organization who where the students

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,470
gone and they're at a bad shape because

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,630
they really wanted some excellent work

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,539
from them that was some cool AI work

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,980
which the student was trying to do

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:14,880
because she got ill or something like

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,159
that so that's okay so students should

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,090
take care of that too and that would

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,980
actually leave a bad mark if another

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,270
mentoring organization comes to know

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:32,480
about it they might not select you for

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:32,480
the coming year so any other questions

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,220
you

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:50,900
okay what do we want from students know

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:53,420
basically we want passion basic

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,420
programming skills at least what I have

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,450
seen in opensuse basic programming

00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:02,750
skills to help but if you are trying to

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,820
contribute to say a bsd or linux kernel

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:10,490
you need to be a hardcore hacker then

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:14,810
soft skills yeah this is a very

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,300
interesting and tough topic usually what

00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:20,410
happens what we usually hear from

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:25,400
students 'as i submitted my proposal and

00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:28,400
I did not get in so you need the idea is

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,710
the person does not know you you need to

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,510
form a trust relationship with the

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,010
mentor on the other end because at the

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,950
end of the day he is getting ten

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,020
proposals it's just like you're going on

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,830
an interview and trying to convince the

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:45,920
mentor right so you talk to him you say

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:48,710
okay I am willing to do this and show

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,680
him you do dot basically you are saying

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,430
I talk is cheap right so basically that

00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,320
is where what we said contribute code oh

00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,500
so when you are talking to him be polite

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,820
you cannot be aggressive about it like

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:07,100
he's not replying so he is a bad mentor

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,830
mentors have their life too so they may

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,810
not reply for a week or so that's quite

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,510
ok with us even though we don't prefer

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:18,860
it that's quite ok students should

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:21,620
understand they should be polite not go

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,150
on a rampage it happens every year in

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:28,460
one or the other projects and yes of

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,250
course long-term commitment once the

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,580
google summer of code is over we do

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,710
expect you if not contribute to the

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,380
existing code base be involved with the

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,380
project in some way or the other that's

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,890
good if it does not happen something

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,900
somewhere is wrong and that's bad and

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,320
that's actually bad for the students

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:54,770
only not for the project because

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,519
projects okay you were there for three

00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,919
months it does not make a big diff

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,929
for us but it's bad for students because

00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,940
they suddenly lose out on the learning

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:09,269
curve and stuff like that but that is

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:11,369
what we expect the end results of ji

00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:14,249
sook I think both of us can attest to

00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,899
that that it's it you feel much better

00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:18,570
after you complete a summer of code

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:19,889
because ultimately it's the feeling that

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,239
you have achieve actually achieved

00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:24,509
something you've contributed to

00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:27,239
something and that something you have

00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,099
built is actually going to be used by so

00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:33,659
many people by the entire community so

00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:39,329
the feeling is pretty awesome so the

00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:43,709
thing that open source yeah it's mostly

00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:45,749
about mentors so it's one of the most

00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:48,329
important things about the summer of

00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:49,950
code is Minter's because after all the

00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:54,599
summer of code is basically a mentoring

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:58,259
program and so a mentor can be anyone

00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:01,289
who wants to actually help us on his

00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,059
knowledge personas experience to a

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:05,820
person who is willing to learn from him

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,329
so it can be it does not have to be a

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,119
very very experienced person it does it

00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:16,349
actually anybody can be a mentor who is

00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:19,559
actually willing to do so so the main

00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:21,509
possible facets about a mentor is to

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,259
they want they basically want to include

00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:27,359
new mentors into the project and get

00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:29,159
some additional manpower for which they

00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,889
don't actually have the time so a

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,629
component which they feel is they don't

00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:35,759
need to spend a lot of time to develop

00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:38,070
so somebody is it they can delegate it

00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,309
to their students and that often works

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:43,349
out very well and basically sharing

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:50,940
knowledge so that's the main aspect of

00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:53,729
mentoring and so I just for the second

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,559
point one thing winters should actually

00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:57,450
that is something about Hannah told me

00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,700
yesterday so one thing mentor should

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,879
actually take care is they actually get

00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,509
some good work get done Oh anyone heard

00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:10,290
of Nome cheese the cheese application

00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:12,600
yeah it runs solely on g shock

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:16,170
every year the cool contributions is

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,270
from energy shock itself i believe most

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:21,240
of the work has been over fifty percent

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:23,910
of the code bases from g soccer itself

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,950
so that's its a brilliant application

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,680
you do some phase detection and stuff

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,700
like that are they fix over it so does

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:37,350
it okay the last part this actually i

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,660
think okay before there's any questions

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,930
again because that's the last part

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,370
that's the open discussion thing and

00:26:41,930 --> 00:27:08,910
maybe we could discuss how do we improve

00:26:44,370 --> 00:27:11,580
and stuff like that any questions okay

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:15,600
because I SC layer some numbers for

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,930
secession and fail right so after

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,320
question do you have a numbers of how

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:25,170
many men chose waster Susur and who is

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,410
the most active mental seen Susan maybe

00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,900
they can share some tips because the

00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:34,350
title is become a mental yeah so if we

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,740
know who is the most active mental maybe

00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:40,170
they have some processing and and tips

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,500
for become a mentor and the second

00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:48,020
question is do you have a numbers who is

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:51,480
the may be the most of all who get the

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:54,810
google summer cold itunes I mean a

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,700
student so every student just got just

00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:03,570
get one just going 1-1 sir was a one

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,910
night run I mean one item so any student

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,370
maybe they attend the Google cervical

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,400
every year and they are lucky to be

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,490
choice over there only get once you know

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,710
this is my question yeah to the second

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,180
question I there is actually no limit to

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,880
the number of summer of course you can

00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,380
do I personally have a friend who's done

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,550
it for the past three years

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,050
so the first question I think with yeah

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:38,070
I think Vincent can answer it better

00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:43,400
later so the first question about was

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:45,780
about the successful matters right I

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:50,430
don't know if we keep track of the

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:53,130
mentors actually because so we know

00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:57,060
every year which metra we have and we

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:59,190
try to invite them again every year to

00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:03,570
make sure that they keep mentoring

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:13,980
people but I don't I don't think we keep

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:16,320
track of who is still there if its

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,130
tightest Excel me delsym statistics

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,190
because we made around every past google

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,070
Summer of Code student and so that was a

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,430
big thing for us to do because we wanted

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,380
them to come back and we made every

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,800
mentor personally if they have time ask

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:37,410
them personally over IRC this time we

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:42,780
from opensuse specifically we have six

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:45,360
mentors every 16 the obvious mentors

00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,880
they keep coming along every year I am

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,790
very glad about it because you don't

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:55,650
need to tell them they just come and do

00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:59,600
it so this is one of the very good parts

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:02,370
in opensuse but other than that we had a

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,890
mentor we have some good mentors from

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:08,910
the community which is a great thing

00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:11,100
again because all the six physics this

00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,050
year's are is from community I believe

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,960
everyone's doing it on personal time no

00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:18,830
help and they just they are just doing

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,470
it on their own which is a great thing

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:25,640
but who can become a mentor and what is

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:28,800
what is a mental and that is something

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:34,730
well obviously everybody can become a

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:34,730
mentor and the my experience is that

00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,860
the people just need to make sure that

00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,630
they have they will have time they will

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,440
need to allocate time for the students

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,380
and I think it's actually the most

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,140
important thing when you are mentoring

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,750
you don't have to like you don't have to

00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,150
be a great communicator you don't have

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,410
to be a good coder or whatever you just

00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,550
need to make sure that you're here for

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:04,430
your student and so I think I don't know

00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:09,050
from your experience as a student menu

00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:10,760
and so on but I think it's really what's

00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,950
important just to make sure that the

00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,270
matter is always available in here and

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:18,860
is proactive when talking to the student

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,990
not waiting for this Jen to come to him

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:24,500
but also going to the student dancing

00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:26,120
okay how are you doing is there

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,840
something I can do to help you and so on

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:32,000
and it's actually in general it's what

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,580
you need in a community in general it's

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,580
not just specific to Chiefs Aqaba yeah

00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:56,680
any other questions okay so let's go to

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,880
a post-mortem where we where so

00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:05,630
basically this is the good which we

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:08,930
heart from this year's g-shock we had it

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,840
on because every they make sure they get

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:16,910
a couple of very good ideas and which is

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,340
very good then we did engage with some

00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:24,620
other projects we are participating with

00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,960
h was the game syslog-ng the slog other

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:30,470
mechanism for sis logging logging and

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,210
then we have 0 w in cloud with us this

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:37,340
year two ideas from them and then this

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:41,300
of course opensuse this is some people

00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:43,850
feel that we are not doing good by

00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,100
collaborating with other projects but

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,130
for that i really think we should have

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:54,730
more ideas and mentors coming up by

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:57,520
march first week or so if that happens

00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,510
maybe we could reduce the number of

00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:04,130
organizations we are collaborating it

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:08,860
but we cannot now certainly close it off

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:11,179
because google looks badly on

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,670
organizations which are not umbrella or

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,260
they just turn in themselves no we are

00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:22,130
not doing it anymore we have more

00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:25,730
selfish and that is how it is yep this

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:29,360
is actually very bad we do not have a

00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:31,700
list of ideas pouring in every year we

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,730
continuously need ideas I think we have

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,390
you asked we have everything we do not

00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:43,040
have a list of ideas pouring in and yes

00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:49,330
the last part is too few mentors

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:52,540
participating I think a project of size

00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,690
from opensuse we could have easily have

00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,180
10 Mentos

00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:00,000
like because there's a lot of work going

00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,970
on maybe we can solve it maybe we cannot

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,540
I just want to discuss it put it on the

00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:09,420
table over here maybe what we can do is

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,840
some mentors do not have time so maybe

00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:15,810
we can just use mailing lists or so to

00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:20,220
communicate I don't know what do you

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:23,160
guys think once in yours like all the

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:27,090
communication for some projects maybe

00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:30,740
just public maybe like Zippo the mentors

00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:33,450
usually do not have a timeline but if

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,820
they usually answer queries on the

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,350
mailing list so if a student is let's

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,600
make the student comfortable on a

00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:41,990
mailing list and let's get out of

00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,990
project

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,899
and I know of course on our projects

00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,480
that have like 30 40 mentors and

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:05,000
students and that really cool we have

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:08,960
about six seven but I would rather have

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,099
six or seven really successful you know

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:18,260
students and mentors then 20 less

00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:20,900
successful ones and I think if the

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,700
projects will be more successful and

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,730
they aren't always terribly successful

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,720
right now I mean not bad but they don't

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:33,410
always work out that great I think if

00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,990
they work out well or better we would

00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:40,310
also get more students and mentors and

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:43,760
time so I would focus on quality of

00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:46,369
quantity now and maybe some of the

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,319
mentors can use a bit more help I mean

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,260
maybe it's better even to have less

00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:52,700
projects and have two mentors per

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:57,140
student or something like that if

00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:59,900
mentors are short on time you know I I

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,170
don't think this is really so bad to

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,869
have to have six projects let's try to

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:08,480
make those six work really well and I

00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:11,270
think the thing that would help most to

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,140
do better also as the number of mentors

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:17,450
is to try and do more on advertising the

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,390
projects so now most of the students

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,579
blog maybe we can help them block more

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,460
we can also help the mentors blog about

00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:27,380
how it goes so that other potential

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,730
mentors can see how it is for a mentor

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,930
to do this right because now the only

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:35,480
see the student so I would say you know

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:39,410
two things I mean try to do to be

00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,690
content with quality or quantity right

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,569
if you have three more mentors and three

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:49,339
of those projects fail what did you gain

00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:51,170
nothing right and the other thing is try

00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:53,690
to communicate also more about what the

00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,970
mentor does and try to talk to them and

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,640
see if they can do a blog doing it feel

00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,440
to something so other mentors or

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,200
potential mentors can see how it helps

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,540
and the thing is for a mentor you know

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,170
that there are multiple reasons why they

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,360
would help

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,430
out right I mean a lot of them might

00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,080
like to work with students but quite a

00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,540
few of them might not like it that much

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,240
but they do it because something gets

00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:21,980
done right they need to get the codes

00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,630
that the students produces now we know

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,330
that it doesn't always work out so well

00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,010
right not all students end up a few

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,320
years later running the program i'm

00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,360
standing here a lot of students

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,820
disappear immediately after the projects

00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,590
that's frustrating for mentors i meant

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,480
us talk about you know how it works

00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:41,480
people talk about the negative more than

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,550
the positive so when other potential

00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,640
mentors hear that the students disappear

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:49,160
after a year where's the motivation to

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,710
spend a lot of time or mentoring or at

00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:56,410
least that may be how they see it right

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:59,840
so so try to focus on on how the mentors

00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:01,430
see it and and that's more a matter of

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,920
me you guys can say it's not that much

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:06,320
work but what the mentors need to see is

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,110
that other mentor say it's worth it you

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,240
know what I mean so I would say try to

00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:14,090
focus on on the communication and on

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,280
what's montorsi and if we could get a

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,920
couple of really successful projects

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:24,680
that get into the next episodes release

00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:27,260
that then get to be part of the release

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,760
marketing right and we can say in

00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,800
release marketing look you know this is

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,990
a google summer of code project and it

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,730
worked really well the mentor says days

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,520
the student says that you know we have

00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:39,410
even a quiltin there that would give the

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,140
google summer of code project visibility

00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:45,680
and positive feasibility and that i

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:48,160
think would be a motivating thing it i

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,950
think that works better than you know

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,390
asking people and trying to push them

00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,610
because this would make them want it

00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,500
without being asked you know what I mean

00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:02,020
try to make the people come to you

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,020
instead of having you go to the people

00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,380
suggesting

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,720
okay next thing is okay the future one

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:17,579
was advertising maybe we could contact

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,759
the students and send some blog posts to

00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:25,609
Google itself they publish it on their

00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:30,000
open source blogs next we might have

00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:34,950
google codeine coming in or google

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,279
codeine is a small for school students

00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:42,089
basically school students who are not in

00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:46,049
a university but still studying it has

00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:49,529
different goals so if you like some

00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:52,920
documentation if you like some marketing

00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:58,799
or if you like to write some do some QA

00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:01,200
testing user or write some CSS or write

00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:03,750
some code making a simple website within

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,359
two days if you are a school student of

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,559
course you can get it it's a competition

00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:13,799
it's not paid so it's a competition and

00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:16,349
the top three students I think they go

00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:21,210
to Google California for a week and

00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:23,579
Google sponsors their travels and they

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:29,250
also they also go on a sightseeing trip

00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:31,680
in San Francisco and other areas then we

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,920
will have google Summer of Code next

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,089
year again I don't think google will

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:44,970
kill it off so I think this helps maybe

00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:46,859
this can serve us a good guide for how

00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,750
to get into google summer of code as a

00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,700
student because there's no timeline

00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:55,200
there's nothing over there is just what

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:59,670
you need to do there are much more

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,490
better resources online I think it's OS

00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:05,579
labs open source Labs has one very good

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:09,289
guide on being a mentor and also for a

00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:11,940
also how to become an excellent student

00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:14,789
google also has a lot of documentation

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,660
on and go through it created contribute

00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:17,660
code that's it I guess

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:32,870
questions is there is there anything

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:37,430
else i will just stop it so you said the

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:40,040
summer of code starts at march and the

00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,250
students start to coat the august what

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:52,010
happens through that period from march

00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:57,230
to august marsh you start deciding what

00:41:52,010 --> 00:42:00,590
you want to do so you okay this might be

00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:03,980
interesting basically a lot of times we

00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:06,590
find students do not know what to do so

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:10,490
in march maybe you can try out okay this

00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:13,070
sounds interesting i'll try it out okay

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:17,210
i don't like it i'll try something else

00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:20,420
out and i like it i will do it after

00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:23,660
that you go and talk to the mentor and

00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:26,480
said are you interested in the idea if

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:31,430
you are interested in the idea let's do

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:36,890
it help me out to do it and we'll do it

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:39,560
oh this is March April you start

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,420
contributing code basically you start

00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,760
working out the details if it's a

00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,500
totally new project maybe you start

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,940
thinking about the details what you want

00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,750
to implement and how you want to

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,210
implement it or if it's an old project

00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:56,000
where you can try getting in some

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:58,220
patches get to know the source code get

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,640
some enter self and along with that

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:05,960
write a proposal by May first week you

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,300
submit your proposal on by April 24th

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,610
it's a April last week to may first week

00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:15,800
I'm not sure about the timeline but you

00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:17,600
submit your proposal or then in May we

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,580
decide with students to take the

00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,830
organization's decided students to take

00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,600
and then you start coding for the next

00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:29,069
three months and that's the official

00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:32,219
g-shock period thank you think

00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:32,219
eating us

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,140
ok

00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,619
