Title: Jos Poortvliet - Asking for travel sponsorship through openSUSE Connect - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	The openSUSE Travel Support program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests with their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford going to these events otherwise. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.

Starting with this oSC'13, requests to the openSUSE Travel Support Program are managed through a new web application integrated into openSUSE Connect. In this talk, the main developer of this new tool will explain how you can use your existing Connect account to submit new events, to ask for travel support for a given event and, which is most important, to get your money reimbursed once your travel is over.

okay so this talk was supposed to be

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,599
give back or who is not here

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,300
unfortunately now he's had to replace so

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,009
we will both carry flattered and it well

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,560
is going to start with a little bit of

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,180
introduction to transport dragon after

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
that I will quickly go over the web

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:32,880
interface to show you how it works in

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:34,920
practice hello hello so the idea is

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,780
after talk to present the new

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,710
application for the travel support

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,739
program so a brief history we start the

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,789
program one year and half ago yeah a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:51,149
little bit and in the program the idea

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,760
was to help our people opensuse people

00:00:51,149 --> 00:01:00,840
to attend conference or events in their

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,070
region or any place in the world so we

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,820
are sponsored by Susan to sponsor

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:14,729
opensuse people then in the beginning we

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:21,360
start we found a teammate small team Jos

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:24,509
NHA first and then me and cost us so

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,710
they the way that we work use your casa

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,840
we want to to have any kind of supports

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,070
nuts and mayo and do it talk about it

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,619
you had a spreadsheet with details and

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,829
then revolt to the side about whose

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:46,409
father or not and we did this for one

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:49,049
year damn the whole workflow was like

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,710
emails coming and going in pretty hard

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:59,299
to make reported details then the team

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,320
changed a bit the Suzy has now

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,570
represented by a good thing the

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,990
open-source team lead said Susie and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,990

she's the person that helped us a lot to

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,350
him verse people so she's part of this

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:34,250
she is responsible for this part of the

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:36,319
process with this um we got a tool to

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,270
help us to deal with the application

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,269
then this application was developed by

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:47,420
opensuse team name of encore his new

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:51,800

agent and he giveth give us the new tool

00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,870
so now anyone that wants to use or make

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,840
a request must use the new application

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,530
that chance will show you so what

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,290
changed now um we will keep the same the

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:14,030
same process but now i have a toast to

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:19,310
to control them what do i want to tell

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:21,980
you there is this year i'm considering

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,250
these are the quarters so the last

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:32,299
quarter from 2012 and the first quarter

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:35,989
so that's the place that are open suse

00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:40,280
people attended with our help so this

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:45,350
conference okay so see many countries we

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:51,769
have been represented then I just to to

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:55,700
tell yous we had 11 we request 9 process

00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:58,609
and him bursted into the side too okay I

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,540
i have condition also I don't need an

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:09,410
investment so but we work it for this 11

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:12,440
process we helped our board manage few

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:16,489
hecatombs such as at work macchiato our

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,979
motto bucks quite haga to in the board

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:21,049
face meeting itself with you live part

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:24,699
of the process okay and

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:28,520
the conference now since last year

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:30,949
officially the thp team is dealing with

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,740
our own conference like summit and

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,729
open-source cops ask so for us this year

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:45,259
you had 26 applications and 60 people

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:46,930
approve it to be here ok now so here you

00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,659
can find a way that you can apply

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:57,409
information about our rules and you have

00:04:50,659 --> 00:05:07,669
few rows and now we we discuss it with

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:13,580
our boards and we just yeah so this is a

00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:17,090
few new rules to be implemented ok why

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,419
we we are always improving because few

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,360
situations happen with the experience so

00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:28,430
after one year half we see that we need

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,389
to to add different things to help us to

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,389
help people to attend and help others to

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:39,560
be attended to attend as well so the

00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:42,680
idea is to have always much people as

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,159
possible joining the conference we have

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,330
budget but the budget must be well

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:53,090
manjit so that's the reason we are we

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:58,250
are wanting to implement these new rules

00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:01,520
so I believe they there's no big deal so

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,069
far we're going to update our wiki page

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,360
with these but just for you guys to know

00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:10,759
about the reason until now we never

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,090
denied any application that would

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:17,990
involve any of these rules because this

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:21,529
wasn't the game ok but for now on these

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,400
would be things that will change also

00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:29,389
now we are going to be straight today

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:33,649
today deadlines so if we ask for six

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,360
weeks prior for her quest is because we

00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:38,259
need

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:42,219
you know cuz uh we are team each people

00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:44,919
living in different place it's day life

00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,860
so we need this kind of time to deal

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:51,300
with applications and also when you send

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,129
a request we go to check about the event

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,900
sometimes you need to make questions

00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,090
about the band how many people fifteen

00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,750
percent not for opensuse and all the

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,930
stops so we need time that you live also

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,370
after the conference the events we asked

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:12,580
for everybody to send us the receives

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:17,080
until two weeks after our conference or

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,810
events finished why again it's a lot of

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,919
work and after process all the receipts

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:29,699
I need to send for for the person inside

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:33,219
suzy to do she you see and then like

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:38,080
opens loosely must to look and approve

00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:40,870
and then send to to Susie chambers so

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,129
the process is a bit long it's pretty

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,669
hard to do if you don't make unlike some

00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:51,909
deadlines I'll be working for a year and

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:54,219
Susie as well just to deal with one

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,050
process so that is ok two weeks and

00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:59,560
after two weeks we send all the process

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,599
from embarrassment and it's done we are

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:09,159
trying to make the umber sment most are

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:12,370
for four weeks after process so if you

00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:17,620
if you take two weeks to send to us we

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:20,740
can take like five days more after that

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,740
and then you can proceed it for weeks ok

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,289
so there is at least at least four weeks

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:32,320
sometimes with holidays or you know like

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:36,789
now or vacations time like here in

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:40,089
Europe is Joan to pay me right might

00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:44,050
Jetta I we might need that extra week

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:46,089
for it but we we don't want to pass 40

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:52,110
days so I think

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:52,110
step okay should I open for questions

00:08:55,439 --> 00:09:09,699
yeah I think so can I should I ok please

00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:13,629
read okay let me explain a bit let me

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:15,879
see change of plans let me explain why

00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:18,339
we decide to make this new

00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,839
implementation like change of plans for

00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,519
have to change your plans after this

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,819
part has been approve it you have to

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,329
request a change and get data proven why

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:31,749
that so you send your request to stay

00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:34,809
like covers like these for five days so

00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:38,769
you requested a support for five nights

00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:41,319
hotel and then your flight if you change

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,410
your your time here to find my not

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:47,829
change but the hotel should be and if I

00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:51,040
approve you I didn't approve all the

00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:54,209
pressure to come so these like okay I'll

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,679
I cannot stay for five days just three

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:59,679
if you tell me before I can help

00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:05,800
somebody else to come here so that's the

00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:08,649
idea so now this is really important so

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,100
if you ask for five days in your

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:18,970
authority will you show just two days we

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:23,949
owned um chambers arrow okay to be a

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:27,550
lost I'm sorry it must be hard to

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:30,429
make things happen at first of course if

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,050
you have problems like images or

00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,970
something like this okay you can work

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:38,529
with this kind of information you know

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:41,379
in any case I of doubts we sent to the

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:46,300
board and your back help us decide what

00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:51,689
to do okay if I were going to another

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:55,179
conference like am acad happen last week

00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:56,680
yeah almost the same week so if you

00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,200
decide to attend like Academy

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,410
and opensuse conference that's okay it's

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,839
great but we want two guys to tell us

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:08,890
because then kept coordinated Dan and

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,950
maybe share your your expenses with them

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,730
you know and also the most important

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:19,270
thing besides this sponsorship is if you

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,770
are coming here and going there you can

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:26,230
be a opensuse presentation at this event

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:30,130
so we're going to put a lot of pliers in

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,649
your bag videos and then you can

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:36,040
advertise about us because you are part

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:38,440
of us there so that's the idea so it's

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,149
pretty important for us to know which

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,860
events you were being too to make

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:48,610
together uh oh i'm sorry but you can not

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,360
a sponsor wife girlfriend boyfriend

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:56,380
water or whatever you know so it's of

00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:00,820
course you can bring your wife but it's

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,760
up to you you cannot help okay of course

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:10,000
if you are a wife is part of the project

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:12,400
great if not we can um here always when

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,350
you send our proposal or you ask the

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,040
place that you live most of people we

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,920
know because we make search about the

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,330
price of the flights have a better

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:30,250
alternative also and we look for your

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:34,830
your contributions for the project yeah

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:38,529
yeah no we are just telling why we are

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:41,079
we are taking this because they think

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,360
that changed that's the only thing that

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,380
change before if the price wasn't

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,290
reasonable we usually send our mailbag

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,630
say hey look this option might be

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,510
shipping for you and for us and blah

00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,060
blah blah now would be different if the

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:02,110
best not reasonable I'm sorry we've not

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:05,700
even I think to consider a second

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,010
request so you'll be rejected by the way

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,140
why because it's we are growing you

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,300
cannot

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:14,430
like because this might look like a

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,100
second chance and then then we keep

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:25,760
somebody else outside then the last one

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:28,770
let me finish this one in it um oh here

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:36,030
what change like here we have a lot of

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:39,090
people that fear in Greece soup which is

00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:42,720
sponsored and we needed volunteers and

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:45,150
you didn't find them here so it's not

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,070
that much to helping your own conference

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:52,500
so we who are wanting to put Morse are

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:55,350
strings about if your sponsor please

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,080
help us I don't think we need to ask you

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,960
guys to go help you know it's not like

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,740
hey you must to help it's in case we

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:13,920
need would be really nice to have your

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:16,680
step yeah okay I think it's okay earlier

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,990
the medical is to follow it spread the

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,130
money the more people puzzle we want

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,770
them almost everyone from the community

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,810
cannot go somewhere to go there and

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,760
supportive and sees it and of course the

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,970
last one it's something very reasonable

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,040
you get sponsor in order to go there and

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,390
promote open suse that's where you get

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,950
sponsored not because you're beautiful

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:43,200
or something like that right so yes help

00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,600
will be asked and most of the times that

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,250
you will get sponsored you will get you

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,710
will get you sponsored because you will

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,070
go there have a booth or do something

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,170
like that it's I think it's nothing but

00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,360
it's not eligible original it's just

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:00,480
that it was not in there in the rules

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,370
and we just put it on the rules because

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,370
we had some instance of that

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:16,090
any questions no questions okay I'm just

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,640
going to show how to travel sport

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:21,040
application works so it's not a terribly

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,400
complicated thing obviously try to make

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,640
it as simple as possible but one of the

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:33,210
reasons why we do this here is of course

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,210
to get feedback on the application and

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,770
my mouse decides to stop working and

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,770
it's something about the room isn't it

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:57,779
yeah but it's going like me yeah okay

00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,779
and now I just want

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,060
yeah dude give me sir

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:27,350
okay unfortunately can't see myself so

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,209
this is a little bit difficult for me to

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,520
do with this way again I'm replacing

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:36,620
uncor and you know I don't know as much

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:38,330
as he do does so the idea is to go over

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,100
the application and over the process

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,950
sorry now I'll I'll do it myself here so

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,450
well you've just seen Isabel talk about

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
the child support program the goals and

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,170
how it works or I'll do that part

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,690
quickly and after that we go over the

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:58,149
online tool to create manage requests

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:01,220
and create a mandatory investments so

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:04,880
this is all what you've already heard so

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:11,870
I'm going to jump over this the way the

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:14,630
process works is yeah it's basin then

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:21,850
I'll go and start work what that now

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:24,559
that we okay let's see how that works ah

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,800
that is nice yes that's one way of doing

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,800
it

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:42,929
I think now it'll

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:48,700
oh this works yay for technology okay

00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:52,269
travel support program so it starts with

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,980
the request obviously there are a couple

00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:56,350
of requests as you see here these are

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,149
also on the wiki but they are also in

00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,309
the program in the application so that

00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:02,080
you can see there what kind of

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,769
requirements we have what kind of people

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,570
we try to support as much as possible so

00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:10,419
have to be an active member relevant has

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,299
event has to be relevant for a loser has

00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:16,059
to be in time as Isabel already pointed

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,789
out and we need to have a good idea of

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,009
the costs now in principle you can only

00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:25,210
get travel and hotel costs supported

00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,730
food and other things will be on your

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,799
own and as a general rule i believe we

00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,990
approve up to eighty percent normally

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,200
although if necessary we can make

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,999
exceptions there like with everything

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,409
now the committee looks at the request

00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:43,179
doesn't even do anything there we go so

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:46,749
the committee looks at the request and

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,490
then approves an amount pair you know

00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:52,419
for the ticket for a flight for the

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,309
hotel etc and they will check indeed for

00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:58,230
the best prices to see if your request

00:18:54,309 --> 00:19:00,789
is reasonable now you then we'll see

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,399
that the committee has looked at it and

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,879
has approved certain amount and then you

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:08,919
have to say okay that is cool I can go

00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,799
so you have to then approve the current

00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,740
state and then you can go to the event

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,779
of course keep in mind we have a guiding

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,059
principles don't yell at people be nice

00:19:16,779 --> 00:19:23,049
give them hugs but not that they don't

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:24,850
want to you know and do the stuff that's

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:29,730
in general you're supposed to be doing

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:36,269
there after that you take the receipts

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:39,519
send them in an envelope try and sorry

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:42,639
you can upload bar is let us use can

00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:46,509
delete and plug the website a we're

00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:49,019
moving on wonderful yay for 2013

00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:49,019
technology

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,340
ok so it's expensive to have an invoice

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,920
we cannot pay as in Susan cannot pay

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,560
anything without a receipt if you lose

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,200
receipts or did not ask for them we're

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,630
sorry but we cannot reimburse you and

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,630
keep this in mind and receipts have to

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:10,910
correspond exactly with the deal that

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,830
was made before so if you said before

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,230
i'm going to take the hotel it's going

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,880
to cost 100 euros and the deal was you

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,220
get 80 euros the back then you go over

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,860
and see for 200 kilos you get 80 euros

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,110
yeah and they're funny and it's because

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,590
it allows this there was not a deal so

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:32,930
again it cannot be approved that's why

00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:36,100
okay so there are coffee with you oh no

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,570
I mean let's help them do provide

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:45,590
personal business matters a lot more

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:54,340
when they are collected some device as

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:54,340
me no I can t tell your initials labs

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:04,310
would make a mess is it open up it's

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,470

application the if you are not approval

00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,160

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,990
ask there it was in today nice thing but

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:45,650

rules and the laws is different for each

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:01,580
country so it's pretty hard to deal with

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,670
Japan different way we

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,750

so people in our thumbs in the past but

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,090
it is really really difficult and a lot

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,480
of paperwork and sometimes it doesn't

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:30,950
work out still and that's just yeah like

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,170

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,409
means bigger chance on reimburse with

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,820
the next time by the way so it's worth

00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:36,559
putting in a little time there and it

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,929
helps us to communicate the community

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,909
what you did of course so this is really

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,940
helpful writing a blog obviously it's

00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:46,429
bonus points then you ads as you see the

00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:51,370
invoices and you can just scan them and

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:54,529
upload them here and you get that ring

00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:57,620
you click again at the end of the bottom

00:24:54,529 --> 00:25:01,220
on action submit and then it gets sent

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,130
to the committee they will check if the

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,899
you know receipts are the compliant with

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,399
the request that you did before so they

00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:11,419
will check the amount of days in the day

00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:16,899
the event I mean to see if it's all what

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:18,980
was supposed to be and we will then

00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:21,620
reimbursement process or send it back to

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:27,200
you so you can our tax information or

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:29,929
out receipts that you missed okay you

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,409
have at the end art one document with a

00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:37,120
signature what is this I hadn't seen

00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:37,120
this not that you need

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:53,110
okay you get this document outs yeah

00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:57,580
okay so there's a page you printed sign

00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:03,070
it scan it uploads and then we can start

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:06,910
the actual reimbursement so it's not a

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:09,850
terrible complicated thing just go

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:15,030
