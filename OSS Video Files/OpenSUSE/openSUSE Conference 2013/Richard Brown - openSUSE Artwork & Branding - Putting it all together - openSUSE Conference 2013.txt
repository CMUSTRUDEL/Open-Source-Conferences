brand the artwork team explain what all

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,400
this branding stuff about and then go

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,170
through the details of how we select the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,600
designs that we then use when we are

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,460
theming opensuse just for each version

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,820
of distributions the default wallpaper

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,610
the color scheme and all of that stuff

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,009
how we pick the design how we put it all

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,840
together the stages we go through what

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,450
we actually have to change how we change

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,759
it what technical requirements we have

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,950
what artistic requirements we have a

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,740
little bit about the legal and copyright

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,640
stuff we have to worry about and then at

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,130
the end they'll be time for questions

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,369
and like I say the workshop at twelve

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,369

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,930
Andy we've got a really good team of

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,099
really enthusiastic people some of us

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,640
mean you can see what we're up to all

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,250
the time I mean your t-shirts were done

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,599
by Carlos most of this stuff of this

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,540
conference was done by the community

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,700
artwork team they produce t-shirts they

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,840
produce the artwork for posters across

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,540
the community images for blog posts

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,720
business cards we even do a little bit

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:53,290
of work on fonts wallpapers the CD

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,230
sleeves the booth box there's a huge

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,620
range of artwork stuff that we as the

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,180
community do for opensuse I'm even

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,090
letterheads for like official letters

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,920
stuff like that arranging compensates we

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,609
did one for this conference we do one

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,980
for summit in the titty asian and in

00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:16,560
fact this template is selfless was done

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,560
by by me at part of the artwork team

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,569
so we have a mailing list it's where

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,359
most of the output team spend most of

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,430
our time talking because we spread

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:29,769
around the world we try and do some

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,810
stuff in RC but you know some of us in

00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:35,200
Brazil's summer in America I'm in

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,359
England we have I think two computers

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,739
from Asia now as well so getting us all

00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,019
together at the same time is really

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,189
really difficult so most of the time

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:45,099
we're talking about stuff on the mailing

00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,680
list coming up with new ideas sharing

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,359
new concepts so what a lot of the

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,269
artwork team spend their time doing is

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,069
just thinking about what is this what is

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,439
this that what do they want think of

00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,750
this you know maybe for 13 one maybe the

00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,180
32 you know I came up with this crazy

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,599
artistic idea they'll put together a

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,840
concept posted to the mailing list get

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,150
feedback get ideas as you'll see whether

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,500
they talk about the branding stuff later

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,439
lot of those ideas never end up in the

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,079
distribution but it's amazing how many

00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,479
of those ideas end up being part of

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,039
cheese a t-shirt staff conference stuff

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,430
for the marketing stuff so we really

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:28,060
encourage your artists to be creative

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,409
come up with new ideas and even if we

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,240
can't promise that we'll get it in like

00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:33,880
the distribution or in like an official

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,530
channel some way we we want to see those

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,320
ideas it inspires other people it gets

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,030
everybody thinking and that's the best

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,270
place to get started is um is our are

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,750
meaningless the IRC best place to go if

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,030
you need help just send someone a ping

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,490
if one of us is there we can give you a

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,760
hand we can tell you what we're doing

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,960
how to do it another stuff and every

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,389
single thing that the artwork team do

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,180
all of those materials or the t-shirt

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:08,919
design everything all currently lives in

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,780
github in hitter opensuse artwork which

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,370
is the biggest git repository I have

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:18,250
ever seen it is huge if you have if you

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,169
have a small amount of bandwidth I'm

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,800
sorry it's going to take you days to

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,500
download it it will it it's too big

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,789
almost we try and tidy it up and then it

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,750
just gets bigger and then we tied you up

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:31,950
again and then it gets even bigger

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,020
I've been speaking to a few people this

00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,850
week we're trying to come up with a

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,220
better idea maybe something like own

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,460
cloud which the artist will still be

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,410
able to use even easier but at the

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,160
moment just like everything else with

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,410
opensuse eating it up and download that

00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,170
to your machine and you'll have every

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,940
bit of artwork assets design ideas that

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,720
we've ever come up with everything's in

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,260
them but I'm not really here to speak

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,940
about the whole out working today I'm

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,180
going to talk about my one little bit of

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,340
it the branding so when we talk about

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,340
branding in opensuse it's not like the

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,930
traditional marketing branding in the

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,360
sense of you know designing a brand like

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,810
coca-cola and having a consistent image

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,080
across the world we're not that kind of

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,400
project and Suzy have another marketing

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,280
people so when we're talking about

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:32,610
branding it's it's more of the well the

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,080
the taking the logo branding it

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,810
into our product and making sure that

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,810
it's a consistent look and feel for for

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:42,600
our users but and making the

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,030
distribution look like a consistent

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,180
branded product so we're not talking

00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,190
about defining how the entire project is

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,250
meant to use our our logos and how to

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,350
make the user our designs but taking

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,960
that design and actually implementing it

00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,730
as part of the distribution so when you

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,430
see the default wallpaper and the logos

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,350
the login screens that's us that's the

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,580
branding team the moment it's me and

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,870
Bruno Friedman in Switzerland mainly

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,680
it's a lot of work for just two of us

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:16,500
and what I'm really hoping from today is

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,390
people on the live stream that people

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,130
get interested want to start helping out

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,500
and actually can start working with me

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,720
and Bruno to do more stuff like yes I'll

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,180
explain at the end there is a lot of

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,110
stuff we could be doing that we just

00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,570
don't have time to do and it's a shame

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,830
because people come to us and you know

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,870
companies like this and say why don't

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,580
you do this and I'm like I'd love to

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,080
it's an also pie dish it's just going to

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,210
take me two days and I haven't got days

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,730
to do it

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,030
so what do we actually do well we take

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,430
the designs the concept the crazy ideas

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,170
that the artists are coming up with and

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,700
we try and find a way of taking the best

00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:03,220
of them and using them as the design for

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:06,400
a distribution so 11.4 12.1 4.2 12.3 all

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,560
of those ideas started as stuff on the

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,660
web artwork mailing list of you know why

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,120
don't we do this and then me and Bruno

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,640
took that idea try to actually make it

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,790
work in the distribution in all of the

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,970
places where we use it me and Bruno not

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,540
artists we occasionally dabble and mess

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,950
around in inkscape and photoshop but

00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,840
we're not making artistic decisions

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,850
we're working with this stuff we are

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,150
trying to find the technical best

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:36,340
solution to get this working in the

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,430
distribution and then worrying about

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,960
making it look good at the same time but

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,970
really we want the artists to be telling

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,780
us what looks good they've got a better

00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,010
eye for it than we do but when it's like

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,270
the last week of the release I'll be

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,920
honest there's been times when I've just

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,230
had to like make a change throw it out

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,250
and hope that everyone likes it then

00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:00,160
normally they do sometimes they don't so

00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,690
with the branding the stuff that

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,740
actually ends up in the distribution on

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,420
the CD the wallpapers the splash screens

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,510
the logos the things you see in grub the

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,610
color scheme you see in the ass while we

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,480
do the design work for that in the big

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:19,030
artwork we both in get up we take it all

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,220
and put it in the branding we both ink

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,130
it up separately this is where we

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,980
actually do the work that we use to

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,440
build the package that goes in OBS then

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,180
lives in the distribution later on so if

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,360
you for whatever reason want to download

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,540
the latest wallpaper and you don't want

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,400
to do the entire huge artwork get up you

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,920
can go there you can download it you can

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,810
see it and if you had if you want to fix

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,750
anything that you notice is wrong in any

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,870
of the parts of the distribution you can

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,820
put a pull request in there I will get

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,200
it I will almost certainly accept it

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,649
that I love it when someone's doing work

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,889
that I should have been doing

00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,050
and it's great so if you want to start

00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:05,329
contributing that's where you need to go

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:09,079
first and yeah a little bit about the

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:11,240
who here uses github already good bring

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,920
it we've organized it a little bit

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,050
differently in here than how you

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,319
traditionally think about it we leave

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,670
the master branch completely empty and

00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:22,519
we actually make a separate branch for

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,470
every version of the distribution we've

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,499
just done that to stop it getting way

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,970
too big like the word repo did and yet

00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:31,759
still able to keep all of the history of

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,040
all of the changes so we now have a 13.1

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,490
branch it looks an awful lot like the

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,809
12.3 branch at the moment but yeah when

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,259
dating to comfort about will do the same

00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,259
thing there

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,520
so I miss you by my side active is a

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,470
little bit weird so how do we pick the

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,760
design these are the last three designs

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,720
that we worked on the distribution

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,780
there's 12.1 on the right there 12.2

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,410
where we decided to experiment without a

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,990
geek Oh on the wallpaper and then to a

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,710
point 3 which is the black with grow and

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:12,200
that's logo the first thing we worry

00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,270
about is does it look good obviously we

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,240
want our distribution to look nice we

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,590
need this look nice to eat I catching

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
it's the first question we asked and

00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,330
it's the hardest question to answer

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,610
because everybody has an opinion we go

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,590
to the project mailing list we put stuff

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,090
on social networking we try and get a

00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,970
good feel for what the community and

00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,020
everybody thinks about it and everybody

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,060
will tell you someone did something

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,350
different some people will love it some

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,900
people hate it it's met and the artwork

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,790
team we spend the Aqua team spends

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,720
months arguing about this stuff before

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:51,350
we even put it out to the community so

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,180
we end up as a branding team having to

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,910
just do our best to sort of look at all

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,010
that feedback and get a feel but what

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,690
options are really working best what

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,480
ideas people are really calling for

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,760
repeatedly so let's say we'd likely the

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,740
12-point 31 people were telling us it's

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,400
too busy it's too loud it's too noisy

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:13,580
for 4.2 was too bright I wanted it

00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,160
darker I wanted it simpler wanted it

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,640
cleaner but I still wanted the geek oh I

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,340
missed the geek oh so we went for a very

00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,310
dark grey background the first version

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,780
of this was just flat gray people said

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,100
it was two flaps so we ended up making

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,080
it a little bit of a gradient so it

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,560
starts parked in the corner and lighter

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,820
later on but then we put the geko on

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,400
there and we started with just putting

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,280
the logo on it looked too boring in the

00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,440
far too plain that's whether the grow

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,560
logo from markets one of our other

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,560
contributors he decided to do the swirly

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,530
thing with vines and it evolved over

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,180
time to what you see right now

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:56,180
but it is the trickiest trick it past

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,530
the whole thing especially when we quite

00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,760
often go to the community and ask you

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,980
know what he will think can we get like

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,200
two responses and they once he loves it

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,180
once as the exit if we had a hundred of

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,530
responses it might be a bit easier so

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,840
when you see those posts to hang about

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,960
on Twitter and Facebook the mailing

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,150
lists let us know let us know what you

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,150
think because it really really really

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,640
matters and we spend so much we spend so

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,170
much time worrying about this bit it

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,460
gives us less time for the technical

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,260
part when we have to get it ready for

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,460
the deadline then I'm down to like two

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,550
weeks because I've spent all my time

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:31,460
worrying about this first problem so

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:37,160
yeah and then the next thing we worry

00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:38,990
about the legal side our product is a

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,080
product is out there in the big wide

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,850
world and just like with software

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,850
licenses we have to worry about our

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:50,000
content licenses as well we need to make

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,460
sure that they're open source that

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,730
freely available the people can make

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,230
chain well in most cases we prefer it if

00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,600
the license allows people to make

00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:02,660
changes the way our distribution is

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,840
currently decided we have to be allowed

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,720
to freely distributed but if you have an

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,930
artist to do licenses is his designer

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,090
says you must not change it currently

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,370
our current list of accepted licenses

00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:18,230
will allow in the distribution but I'll

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,360
be honest it's unlikely to get past me

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,980
because if I can't change it then I'm

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,710
not likely to be able to use it for

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,300
everything else I have to do with it so

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:30,530
there is a less there of all the

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:37,310
licenses which we use for our content in

00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:38,930
the distribution and ideally we want you

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,150
the contributor actually providing each

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,490
other to be the one who has done the

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,770
artwork from scratch there has been

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,720
plenty of times where we've had

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,470
contributors put something together from

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,660
places like Flickr Picasa and there's a

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,940
great sites and they did some great

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,760
stuff out there

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,200
and they'll artist on on that site will

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,230
go and purchase the lovely artwork and

00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,660
say it is creative commons by

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,880
share-alike license though open source

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,490
it's free get on our list your looks

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,570
fine and then we start working on it we

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,700
put it we start putting it in the

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:16,390
distribution and then we realized that

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,520
that guy in Flickr was lying and it was

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,890
actually someone else's work it wasn't

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,200
under that licence so it's really

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,960
important for us to actually know the

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,120
artist in question know the full story

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,520
about everything that's inside the image

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,520
that you see here in my presentation

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,350
today every single image i'm using i can

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,530
tell you what license the artist did it

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:41,680
under who the artist was and where I got

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,840
it from because if we make a mistake

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,730
like this it's going to be very bad for

00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,920
the community very bad for the project

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,940
and Suzy probably won't be very happy

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,090
with those either so it's it's really

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,260
important this part and it can be quite

00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,790
tricky because you know the internet

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,940
everyone's used to sharing stuff and

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,500
throwing it together and then just like

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,990
open source code with the outside of

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,430
things it's just important and it's

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,190
sometimes really hard to search for this

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,960
stuff so the more you can tell us when

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,510
you set when you're contributing and

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,760
saying yeah I got this from here from

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,890
this guy in its this license disappear

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,320
and that's how I made this book this

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,680
design that's great that's what we need

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,680
to know

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,580
technical stuff name so once once we

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,310
pick the design from an artistic point

00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,600
of view and we've been pretty happy that

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,850
legally it's not going to get anyone in

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,330
any trouble we have to worry about all

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:55,480
the technical stuff as a distribution we

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,410
want the distribution to work on as many

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,950
machines as possible and that means as

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:05,439
many screens as possible and that means

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,000
as many computer screen resolutions as

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,510
possible and that's a little chart I

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,179
just grabbed off Wikipedia today of

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:16,000
about half of the resolutions computers

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:18,459
are using these days and you know they

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,270
start at 1024 x 768 and these days

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:25,600
they're now going past HD and you've got

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:28,900
4000 5000 and it's resolution to getting

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,870
higher and higher and higher and screens

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,240
are not staying the same time you know a

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,429
couple of years ago every screen was

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,630
pretty much for by doing it was a square

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:44,110
and there was a few exceptions graphic

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,330
artists in particular i like to use 5 by

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,330
4 it's a slightly more rectangular

00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:52,120
arrangement so originally open city used

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,880
to just support lifting and then the

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,480
world went wide screen and started using

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,850
like 16 10 which was the whites win the

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
computer screens were using for like two

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,800
or three years pretty much all the time

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,250
and then everyone went HD and decided

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,840
the 1610 actually with too tall to be a

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,380
little bit what's watch sir everything

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,130
went to 69 just like your TV's and

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,590
like your movie screens so right now as

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,610
a distribution we have to support at

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,890
least those four aspect ratios and

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:28,890
ideally that at as many different screen

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,850
resolutions as we can cope without going

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:35,400
crazy that's actually really big

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,290
challenge because you go back to the

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,960
artistic side of things and just jump

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:45,840
back a few slides it to show you and

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,540
then what slightly goes on yeah back

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,060
there you go

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,470
the top design on the top left that

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,080
works fine everywhere it's nice and

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,270
simple there's there's nothing there to

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,660
really get distorted or squish don't cut

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,790
off it works and that's one thing I love

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,830
about the 12.2 design it was one of the

00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:10,500
easiest designs with me to work with

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,750
those resolutions however 2.1 12.3 we

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,600
have things like the vine the geek a

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,600
logo and nights wispy thing on the 12.1

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,200
logo when you start changing the screen

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,970
size and you're not paying attention to

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,550
what you're doing that stuff that's

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:30,510
hitting either squished it's washed and

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:33,260
then looking really ugly yeah talk on

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,260
when we made the mistake

00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,040
big that

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,810
yep we made a few mistakes and 12 for me

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,950
don't wait a few min 12 3 but less of

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:47,900
the puppy and sometimes the answer is

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,150
I'll just just cut the edges off but

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,810
then you cut the edge of like the 12.3

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,520
logo and you lose half of the vine it's

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,940
not dropping off the edge and it starts

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:04,220
actually being ugly or at least less

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:06,980
good than it should be so normally the

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,380
easy technical answer for this is using

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:14,930
scalable performance vector-based

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:17,210
graphics things like svgs where every

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,640
element in there is it's all a

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,490
propagator mail file and every element

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,340
is mathematically defined the vector as

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,430
a shape so when we just when we start

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:31,850
resizing stuff we can resize the element

00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,830
we can resize the canvas and it'll keep

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,530
everything just as we want it when we do

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,210
stuff about very very easily so this

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,370
whole problem about screen resolutions

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,190
and aspect ratios disappears like the

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,650
heartbeat so all those three designs you

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,690
saw previously they are all vector-based

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:52,390
formats because at the moment that's the

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:54,980
only thing I want to work on however

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,980
there's a bit of a problem with that the

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,480
world out there lots of artists

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,370
photography in particular book

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,280
photography that that's never going to

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:08,000
be back to back that's the PNG file or

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,700
JPEG or rafts debates formats you can't

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,870
go and define photograph in a vector

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:18,350
so those kind of designs at the moment

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,669
we can't really use the distribution

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,340
because we haven't really got an easy

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,440
answer but sorting out the different

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,480
aspect ratios are the different screen

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,960
resolutions so we prefer and speech it

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,970
it makes my life easier if we have a

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,539
artist coming us with a design for

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:43,169
something using jpg or PNG or another

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,779
raster bitmap format we will do our best

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:48,269
to work with them and we will try and

00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:51,090
find a way to take that design and still

00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:54,149
keep it looking good and cut it up for

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,519
these different screen resolutions but

00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:59,399
I'll be honest love them I tried it it

00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:02,130
didn't work out we just couldn't find a

00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:08,100
way to make it work

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:10,950
so inkscape adobe illustrator the vector

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,780
based tools those are the ones we are

00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:16,350
coming to using on the branding team to

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:18,990
make this stuff work and other designs

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,320
end up being done in photoshop or in

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,090
 we end up trying trying to put them

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,370
in other packages in like community of

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,350
other packages to encourage people to

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,090
yet still get them still have it as part

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,790
of the distribution but it will never be

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:36,260
part of the core branding that we use

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,260
everywhere in the description

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:44,090
and then last but not least smaller five

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,690
sites this was my mistake in 4.3 put my

00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:50,059
hand up say sorry to everybody I made

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,350
the full paper for to a point doing and

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,450
I didn't pay attention to how big the

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,679
files were getting and they were getting

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,510
bigger and bigger for the artists were

00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,679
coming up with more more cool ideas and

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,910
they were working and I was shoving

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:05,330
those ideas of the package and then I

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:08,600
push all of that to factory and then

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:10,340
kudos starts screaming at me because

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,630
I've managed to make a package that was

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,700
around about 120 megabytes in size on

00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:20,030
its own and that doesn't really fit on

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,230
the CD very well it didn't fit on the CD

00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:27,140
adorable so we have to try and keep our

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,140
designs technically efficient from the

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,490
far side as small as possible because it

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,970
does actually have a big effect of a

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,160
user people want to have their inner rd

00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,500
their boot part for the system the

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,580
smallest it needs to be especially if

00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,440
they're installing several different

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,080
kernels they don't want to have seven

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,750
different copies of mine my boots flash

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,309
logos or pletely don't wanna seven

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,720
different copies to fill up the 100

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,590
megabytes of space they're given for the

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,240
boot polish so for 13 1 and every other

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,950
via version in the future we're going to

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,440
be spending a lot more time looking at

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:04,070
this making sure that the design can be

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,830
made to be very very small and efficient

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,350
I'd still work and still look nice still

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,190
healing all the other thing we have the

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,190
way back to the same time

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,600
so how do we put all this together how

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,560
what do we actually do well this is a

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:27,230
short list of about seventy-five percent

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,260
of the stuff we have to change in every

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,960
single version of distribution we have

00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,810
grub which is the legacy bootloader

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,560
which we used to be the default we have

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:42,590
grub 2 which has a totally different way

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,420
of doing its designs and in fact gives

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,150
us a ton of new options if you saw in

00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:50,840
12.3 many does that made a really nice

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:53,180
new design for us so if you if you load

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,190
your sister up in well true you get one

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,500
very very nice splash screen and menu

00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,910
system for picking your version but if

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,200
you load up got one you get the

00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:01,340
old-fashioned walk because we didn't

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,340
have time to change it to make you look

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,290
the same and in fact verb 1 will never

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,030
look the same because I can't use colors

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:12,350
the same way that I can on the new one

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:16,820
so i have to use white that kind of

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:21,070
limits my options gfx Booch which is the

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,950
menu system for the live CD

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,659
we currently brand will change the

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,000
splash screen when you load up Gimple we

00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:32,169
used to go point where we stopped doing

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,350
it no there is a default wallpaper in no

00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:37,570
to worry about and in fact gnome has a

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,809
option of doing dynamic wallpapers that

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,450
change throughout the day so in previous

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,279
versions we've had it so the night time

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,190
the wallpaper was very very dark and

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,259
then got to length sunrise and you made

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,970
it very very bright then the day it was

00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:56,049
even lighter and then we made it go back

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,789
down again well we try our best to use

00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:59,289
like all the special little features

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,409
that we get in all these different parts

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:04,179
of the distribution that means more work

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,379
for us but hopefully it also means it

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,980
looks nice it for everybody when they're

00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:10,870
using it KDE is a fun one because

00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,889
there's actually three different areas

00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,679
where we have to worry about the

00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:17,259
branding there's Katie libs which is

00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,409
where all of the KDE cute applications

00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:21,250
pull their branding settings from

00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:24,159
wallpapers and color schemes and all

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,519
that stuff let's KDE plasma the actual

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,149
desktop them how that looks and then

00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,399
there's KDM the login screen which is

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,929
probably the nastiest thing I've ever

00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,690
had to work

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:41,059
I mean be every time you just about make

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,240
it look okay and then something breaks

00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:47,360
or we've forgotten something in like

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,240
12.2 we managed to accidentally delete

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,070
the field for logging into a domain the

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,960
windows network cursor it made it look

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:57,499
very nice but then no one could look on

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,720
to a windows network really quite me and

00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:01,879
then once you actually log into KDM

00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,820
there's two different splash screen two

00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:06,769
depending on which version you log into

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,850
or which settings you've been so we

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:11,990
currently have the brand both of those

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,700
Libre Office I mentioned there but

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,230
actually near office has changed

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,539
recently we I used to do all of the

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,059
branding for legal office but one of the

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,740
league office developers now is deciding

00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:24,860
to change the splash screen themselves

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,210
and they're doing it their way so that's

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,940
why it looks a little bit different from

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,039
everything else but it kind of works

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:36,320
nicely because label offered is green

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:38,090
anyway so it fits it doesn't really look

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,490
out of place so we're probably going to

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,340
stick with LibreOffice having its own

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,030
designed its own flash grins at least

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,270
for now

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,770
then never the wallpapers we have

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,970
obviously the default wallpaper that

00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,730
everyone sees when they do a fresh

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:57,090
install but this other packages that

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,070
have a quite a large large range of

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,670
wallpapers some like there's the olden

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:04,590
of Earl and the old old Suzy ones

00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,420
there's an extras one this year I'm

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,010
hoping to build a community will paper

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,380
package which is basically going to take

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,400
all of the other designs which we're not

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,630
going to be using the book for 13.1 and

00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,250
take them together put them in this one

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,140
big package which people can install and

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:27,720
see all the good stuff that our artwork

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:30,330
tema making and xfc I mr. lxd yet XFC

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,950
have a few branding things we do lxd

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,420
actually we didn't mention an LSD

00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,610
actually just pretty much inherit

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,160
everything else so it's nice and easy no

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:45,120
work for me and then finally there is

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:47,160
guest and yeah it has the installer the

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,920
install apart during the first bit of

00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,720
the disk and that's really quite

00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,150
interesting on how we have them to

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,670
Brandon just did it

00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:01,860
work with that the whole thing done in

00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:04,620
CSS of slightly modified CSS files and

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,260
in fact there's a CSS editor hidden away

00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,730
inside gassed you can find it by

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,740
pressing ctrl alt shift & S when you're

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,680
doing the installation on the ass this

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,480
little CSS editor pops up and you get

00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,130
you can type in there your CSS click

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,840
apply and it changes in at three months

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,600
so we then do all of that make it look

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,320
pretty and they take out that CSS put it

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,320
inside the branding

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,169
oh and I've also missed out

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,940
enlightenment but enlightenment was a

00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:40,830
bob has currently been themed by the

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,590
Enlightenment guys commented

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,820
presentation yesterday I think it was

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,919
he's meet weekly today which we're going

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,360
to try and cheyenne life women in with

00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,419
the rest of how we do with the branding

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,880
i'm about to explain it's a pretty

00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,159
involved process where we show you the

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,890
script of months off road to automate as

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,110
much of it as we can so if we're doing

00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,450
this all once week might as well try and

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,309
bring other projects in and keep them

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,850
involved some in our material next to

00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,850
the extra work

00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:15,830
and I mentioned the scripture oh if it

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:18,559
is this is still yeah when did you buy

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:23,019
this possum

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,340
a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:27,769
this script it's it's the makefile

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:32,240
inside the the branding repo on it up

00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:36,169
and what it basically does now another

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,860
what it did when it started it takes for

00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:42,289
SVG files one for each of the four

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,200
aspect ratio which we have to worry

00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:47,840
about that i'm betting at this light

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,570
takes those four files runs through a

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,360
whole bunch of different scripts and

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:58,220
will produce all of the different jpg

00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,769
and PNG and PNG's of certain sizes and

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,419
certain color depths and whatever for

00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:05,960
everything that i just mentioned on this

00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:09,129
list so the idea is we start with for a

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,499
3gs and we end up with a roundabout

00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:17,659
think it's more like a hundred jpeg

00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:21,129
bitmap PNG smaller SVG files all in this

00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:21,129
rather complicated folder structure

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,139
there's something descript can't do what

00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,230
I've already mentioned it cannot handle

00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:37,610
the source design being a raft of our

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,960
being jpg so because it ends up being a

00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,710
hundred places where we have to change

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,179
everything when we need to do raster if

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,179
we want to do a raster design as the

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:50,299
default design with opencv 13-2 or

00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:52,610
something we're going to have to have a

00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:56,000
different script someone's going to have

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,710
to find a way of writing it or someone's

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,539
going to have to find a way of doing all

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,389
of that work by hand which will take a

00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:04,759
very very long time especially when

00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:07,159
there are some things that don't make

00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:09,139
sense to do in the script already like

00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,570
Plymouth the bootloader that you see

00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:18,980
after the menu but before you log into

00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:24,309
it that ooh that monk yeah bootloader

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:27,380
loading splash has a very interesting

00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:31,340
scripting engine of its own so you can

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,740
you can do very very smart stuff like

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,380
you might have seen in 12.3 which start

00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:39,380
with a blank version of the wallpaper

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:42,290
without the vine without the geek oh we

00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,049
start with that and then we have a

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,870
plymouth script that's running that's

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:52,700
Raymond would've made and I helped this

00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:54,410
a bit buggy that script checks the

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,230
progress of your boot as it's going

00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:59,630
along and as the book progresses and

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:05,510
gets never to one hundred percent there

00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:09,290
is divine and then there's the vine and

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:10,790
the geek up and we use Plymouth to fade

00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,950
that in at the same time that's how you

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,630
get the boot process looking where it

00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,679
starts brain and it waiting and then you

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,820
get the login window but there's no easy

00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:25,010
way for us to do that in its rip and

00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,230
even if it was it's something we kind of

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,580
like to do by hand any help because

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,370
Plymouth has so many different options

00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,740
and our design is almost certainly going

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:37,270
to call for different ideas everybody's

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,760
so we're doing the plume of stuff by

00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,630
hand anyway the more stuff we can do in

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,630
the description the better

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,399
that

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,950
so when that script runs against those

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:57,700
for SVG files you end up with a whole

00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:00,730
bunch of files in a folder and invent

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,830
you end up with the tar.gz file and we

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,010
send that tardy did fall to the branding

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,440
package in OBS along with changes to the

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,669
spec file if we need it or give the

00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,409
stuff that we have to do for a package

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,800
changelogs obviously other words could

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:17,879
go in me even a signal and that becomes

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,790
the branding national city bank and that

00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,669
package actually has a whole ton of sub

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:27,700
packages so when you see grab grub

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:30,250
attached branding net opensuse that

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,570
actually just a sub package of the main

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:34,330
branding packet so if you want the

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,339
change have rubber looks you have to

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,690
change how you have to change the

00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:40,149
package that changes how everything

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,440
looks which can be a bit scary when you

00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,649
start it out because you make one

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,379
mistake yeah really make factory look

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,000
ugly it's kind of what factory therefore

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,240
but I still don't like making it look

00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,240
ugly

00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,730
but not all packages that end in

00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:02,090
branding dash opensuse actually come

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,550
from the package if it's art work

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,290
related become pretty much I mean

00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,300
enlightenment and legal obviously the

00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,180
exceptions but you pretty much say it

00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:14,990
comes from this package but there are a

00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,030
few other branding packages like GI oh

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:23,830
and what the other one we're using them

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:23,830
runs on some other weird ones

00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:31,000
yep gtk some other and there's a cutie

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:33,580
branding packet as well those branding

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,130
packages are really for default settings

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,619
for the distribution so they don't

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:42,310
really come under the heading of artwork

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,960
and although they share the name I'm not

00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,280
responsible for them I don't look with

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,970
them that much in it's a known one in

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,920
which case on nobody helping out with it

00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,020
but it's not a no BS you can see how

00:35:50,920 --> 00:36:01,080
it's all linked together we're really

00:35:53,020 --> 00:36:01,080
flipped it so 13.1

00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:06,769
my to-do list of the moment for the

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:09,140
branding I kind of forgot to mention the

00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:12,109
most important thing for the first time

00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:15,339
that I can remember we are not going to

00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:18,499
have a new design for that appointment

00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:22,069
basically everybody liked 12.3 so much

00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:25,069
we decided we'd stick with it no one

00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:28,670
gave the negative feedback so the first

00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:31,910
time 13.1 is going to still have the key

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,589
code with the pipe and there might be

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:37,459
some slight changes but on the whole

00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:39,680
it's the same design so we're going to

00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:41,239
spend the time instead doing things like

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,219
this working with the community figuring

00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:46,779
out if we can get more volunteers to

00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:50,239
help us in the future and spending time

00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:52,789
tidying up what we didn't get right into

00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,859
a point three so the first thing like i

00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:57,589
mentioned we need to make the file

00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:59,920
smaller we do even then we want to keep

00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:02,479
it looking pretty much exactly the same

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,549
I'm getting my thinking cap on and

00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:06,589
messing around with svgs and finding out

00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:10,160
other ways of doing things to actually

00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:12,349
get that wallpaper looking sir but

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,299
instead of being 60 minutes I want them

00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:18,289
to be six minutes in size

00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:20,299
I'm about 30 makes up for the moment

00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:23,239
so that's what priority number one

00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:25,819
that's sir anyone here knows how to do

00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:28,729
lots of wonderful stuff in SVG's in

00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:35,589
particular things like noise or special

00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:38,390
events please tell me help I need it and

00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:40,279
yeah hopefully we reckon if we go to the

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,339
moment the SVG file we have at the pro

00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:45,109
point three it's mainly vectors and then

00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,969
we cheated and we did a couple of JPEGs

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:49,189
and we shove them in the background it

00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:52,489
again thank Iranian thank you get paper

00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:55,640
and that's what made the Fox of it it

00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:58,599
won't take the jpegs out just happen is

00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,269
an SVG file and have the noise there as

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,310
vectors rather than as a JPEG negative

00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:07,220
shopping

00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:09,950
from the known side of things did I have

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,260
a wallpaper that I mentioned we didn't

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,860
have time to get it right and 12.3 in

00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,630
fact I kind of cheated I just put four

00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,370
versions of the same wallpaper in it so

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,810
it does change but it changes from the

00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:25,340
same feather for the same color to the

00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:27,050
same color which is really ugly the main

00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,700
problem with that has not been time or

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,030
technical problems only them I just

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:36,230
don't have any ideas on how we should

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:37,910
change that wallpaper during the day so

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,740
if anyone comes up with any ideas let me

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,380
show them where it is there's a lot of

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,630
options in Nome of instead of just

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,670
fading in you can do fancy transformers

00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,830
and swapping stuff in and weird and

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,820
wonderful stuff like that if anyone

00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,350
wants to look at it and come with an

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,440
interesting way of making no look

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,640
prettier and change throughout the day

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,900
just talk to me go the art with mailing

00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,880
list that would be great

00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,579
next thing we really really want to sort

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,410
out but that he wanted KDM the tricky

00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:09,010
one that's good it's some more technical

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:13,000
and some artistic at the same time k DM

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:15,190
is a pain like that magic it's a real

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,410
magnet on and it's horrible from an

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,819
artist point of view and it's quite

00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:23,170
probable for technical point of view as

00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:26,140
well so the moment we're trying to

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,839
figure out either from a branding

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:33,309
perspective how we can make it a DM look

00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:35,770
nice and work still keep working or

00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:39,640
there are some questions about whether

00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:43,000
we should just give up and technically

00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,039
speaking stop using a DM as the login

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,440
screen for Katie that's a much bigger

00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,150
question I'm not going to say start

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,599
setting delete request on OBS and

00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,190
knowing all the KD people but it's a

00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,109
discussion that we are trying to have

00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,059
trying to figure out what the KD 2 min

00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:00,460
if you feel like and what they would

00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:05,050
like as a login screen for their systems

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:07,180
and if KDE changes

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,030
and we can make the KD won't look nice

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,040
enough and still work and cover all the

00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,800
other use cases the login screen have to

00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:19,950
worry about then that leads to another

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,930
question of maybe xfce lxde

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:26,290
enlightenment could all actually use the

00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,850
same login to it I purposely avoided

00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,910
saying no because I personally think

00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,620
gnome looks best with gdm that's my

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:36,100
opinion I'm sticking to it but for the

00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:38,890
other distant managers maybe it would be

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,410
nice to have everything unified so if

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,170
you're looking on opensuse machine it's

00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:47,200
going to look like one nice consistent

00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:50,380
staple thing it's a long discussion to

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,380
have it probably won't be fully answered

00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:57,390
for 13.1 but we still have to fix kvm

00:40:53,380 --> 00:41:00,580
because it's a mess the entitlement guys

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,590
they want to be more involved in the

00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,640
branding side of things I don't know why

00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,370
I actually think they didn't really

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,770
wonderful job on their own but so we're

00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,630
going to try and take their stuff work

00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,420
it in with that script and our package

00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,950
at the moment and find a way of and also

00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,420
enlightenment has a very interesting way

00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,740
from doing it steaming and doing its

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,550
wallpapers and all answer them so we're

00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,780
going to find a way of taking our design

00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:26,230
seeing how much of it we can implement

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,180
in enlightenment with them or at least

00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,800
just work closer together we'll bring

00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,800
everything into one big place

00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,780
bit technical but there is the branding

00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,880
Bank dash based on opensuse packages at

00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,560
the moment they were made for a legal

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:49,030
reason the Kim our current trademark

00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:55,040
guidelines for the Open City logo has

00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:56,930
rather robust restrictions on when

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,820
people been used it surf for example

00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,670
which seeks to do someone is making an

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:03,020
open City version and they don't want to

00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,330
call it open suse they want to call it

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,570
something else we still want the

00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,040
mentioning that it's based on opensuse

00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:14,210
so these packages were made before my

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:16,670
time and back then they worked but now

00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,589
with the way we're packaging everything

00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:20,930
else up and the way the distributions

00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:23,089
moved on they're getting in the way and

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:26,540
quite often actually screwing up

00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:28,160
people's machine because they want to do

00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,599
something slightly differently or change

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,920
which branding path which they're using

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,230
maybe they want to use the upstream

00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,349
branding and these packages keep on

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:39,680
coming in conflicting Kiwi bits break

00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:41,599
all this gets really really messy so I'm

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,420
going to meet and hopefully other people

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,170
as well be either fixing them or if we

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,730
can't fix them removing them it probably

00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,050
wouldn't be that good because we do kind

00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,109
of need them the trademark red line

00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:55,970
thing so maybe moving the mouse ran into

00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:57,650
their own repository so at least not

00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,630
messing up people who are running

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,630
factory and running that he pointed one

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,650
we're already doing this but the

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,310
application splash screens for

00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:14,820
believe office for I'm trying to

00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:17,490
remember the other ones now we want to

00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,400
stop branding them they look nice it's

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,710
nice to have a consistent design but the

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,930
upstream projects in question do very

00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,810
nice designs themselves each their

00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,099
product we liked it opens if you like to

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,040
be showing off other people's products

00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:34,349
too so and it's more work for us and we

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,780
have another step on up later so we're

00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:40,710
going to try and stop rebranding

00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:42,570
upstream projects applications and stick

00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:46,760
to focusing on branding after finish

00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:49,920
them and like I already mentioned

00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,240
community wallpapers we really really

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,570
want to be showing off what I tweeted

00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,490
you're doing and given we have to worry

00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,750
about the technical and the legal and

00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,140
the other issues when it comes to the

00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,480
main design for the main distribution we

00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,280
want to take as many of those community

00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,660
wallpapers you start to worry about the

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,329
legal which is the community wallpapers

00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,040
but there's far less technical worries

00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:12,180
about a community design because it

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,220
doesn't have to work on every single

00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,270
screen resolution you might have the

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,790
work arrived on every single aspect

00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,890
ratio so we're going to take those

00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,940
designs and put them in a package have

00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,940
that package about the 13

00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:28,390
yeah that's that's the plan I'm

00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:29,710
currently going through the submission

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,210
now bringing up which one to actually

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:35,599
work it

00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,300
look good generally but yeah they would

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,760
be there so if you're interested please

00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,440
help hopefully I'll work manually go to

00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,200
the RC general speak to me while I'm

00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,400
here the rest of the day we're really

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,770
really interested in getting more people

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:55,119
involved in the artwork side and the

00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:55,119
branding site any questions

00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:07,930
maybe you you're already measured by the

00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:10,840
at least I'm just thinking maybe someone

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:14,560
a major in art and really good at

00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:19,120
drawing and design but i'm not sure if

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:24,490
our process of some mids work github for

00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:26,590
example will block them yes I I agree

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,750
it's something that we've been talking

00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:32,770
about this yet from an artist point of

00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:37,450
view it's not as easy as it could be not

00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:40,660
as easy probably should be and from the

00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:42,880
artwork team side get up with a repo

00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,460
especially that big it's a real pain to

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,070
work on so for the sort of initial

00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:50,340
submission side of things and the

00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,870
artwork team collaboration together I'm

00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,520
looking at other options something like

00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:56,980
own cloud may be running on the

00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,890
input opensuse infrastructure so that

00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,010
would be a nice easy web interface

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:04,270
someone could login put their ideas on

00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,640
there and then when they go to the

00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,830
mailing list and say look at this it's

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,070
very easy for everyone to find the

00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:15,250
change to contribute to et cetera when

00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,820
it comes to the specific part of the

00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:20,380
branding bits end up in the distribution

00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,780
that's going to staying it up it kind of

00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,920
needs to stay and get up that's because

00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,390
that's how we actually work on the

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,730
package so the the artwork side the side

00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:33,600
that the artist will be working on yes I

00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:36,040
would like to see that outside of github

00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,510
yeah I just talk quick goes through

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,400
github our webpage and I think if we

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,390
provide our mailing list all the email

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,930
address for this kind of people

00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:49,930
will be helpful yeah good yes definitely

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:59,170
hello I have two questions the first one

00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:03,760
is do you get any feedback from people

00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:07,780
for not in the open source community not

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:10,480
that much feedback we get the we spend a

00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:14,020
lot of attention on feedback from the

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,790
press so when the open source community

00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,119
in the press are reviewing our

00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:20,670
distribution we definitely love it when

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,930
they say nice things about the artwork

00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:27,250
which for the last two releases they

00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:29,800
have but when it comes to sort of the

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,599
general big wide world no we don't

00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,819
currently get any feedback from that and

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,829
that's something I'd like to fix saw

00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:38,460
something and ito-san is trying to fix

00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:40,300
as well one of our artwork guys he's

00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,130
putting lots of stuff on social media

00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,990
social networking getting people to try

00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,890
and give feedback we have the opensuse

00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:51,910
artworks google+ page so we're we're

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:53,349
trying but at the moment it's going to

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,790
interest open suse people more than it's

00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:56,349
going to interest anyone else so we're

00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,950
always going to have more susie feedback

00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:01,480
and we kind of care about the community

00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,520
more than we care about everyone else

00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,500
you know if you're using opensuse we

00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,079
wanted to look good for you if you're

00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,079
not then we don't mind quite so much

00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,150
okay and the next one is picked a

00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:19,529
technical lane the quest for smaller

00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:22,970
file sizes will be acceptable to bypass

00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:25,890
SPD limitations the following way

00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:28,279
suppose you have this nice noise effect

00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,019
you want to add the girl wallpaper but

00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:35,039
the result of this effect is hard to

00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:38,460
describe in a few kilobytes of size but

00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,529
will be acceptable to have some program

00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,539
like good team in batch mode or

00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:51,260
mathematic generate this affects effect

00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:54,869
on the on some template the SVG template

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:56,760
yeah the others a distribution is that

00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:58,529
all kind of what we're doing or wedding

00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,539
I mean patch magic is what the script

00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:06,119
users have a lot to do a lot of that

00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:08,849
stuff the trick is well okay first why

00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,319
is the current one so big the current

00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:14,369
one is so big because even though it is

00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:18,599
an SVG technically speaking it's an SVG

00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:20,910
with four JPEGs in it because I couldn't

00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,160
figure out how to do the noise properly

00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:26,670
so one of our artists helped out by

00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:30,089
doing the noise in a JPEG and he put

00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,009
that JPEG in the SVG four times to get

00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:34,259
the noise looking right so we have a

00:49:32,009 --> 00:49:37,289
hybrid SVG that actually has this big

00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:39,890
noisy jpg stuff at the back and that is

00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:42,380
why the file is so big at the moment

00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:45,920
if we get those JPEGs out it looks ugly

00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:49,490
but it's much much smaller and I wreck

00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,670
and there are ways like patch magic and

00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:55,400
other stuff that you can make that SVG

00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:58,910
have the noise in it or yes put the

00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:03,079
noise in as part of the the process of

00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:05,000
converting everything there I kind of

00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,859
neglected to mention here but pretty

00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,289
much every single one of these products

00:50:06,859 --> 00:50:12,940
that we brand has different requirements

00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:18,769
when it comes to file size file type

00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:20,630
file format color depth it's amazing how

00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:23,000
many different open source projects and

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,859
it can't be in a decide oh yeah we're

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,369
going to have a wallpaper at the back

00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:30,319
and it needs to be like this so grub

00:50:28,369 --> 00:50:32,150
does one thing dropped rude or something

00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,680
completely different the effects boot

00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,869
need something completely different in

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,670
fact GFX boot needs like a million

00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:40,690
different JPEGs because it can't figure

00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,010
out aspect ratios at all so we have like

00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:48,319
every single resolution you could ever

00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:51,289
possibly have with it if a farm so yes

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,779
we're using patch magic a lot to do all

00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:55,700
that conversion and the magic were there

00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:57,950
but the initial file that's why the

00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,529
initial file really has to be an SVG of

00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,970
some kind at the moment because that's

00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:04,130
where we do that script is where we're

00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:07,670
doing all that conversion to make it

00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:09,950
happen so it gets tricky if I want patch

00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,109
magic to start embedding new stuff in

00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,509
there because I have to make sure it

00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:16,279
embeds it right in all of the other

00:51:14,509 --> 00:51:19,700
formats that we're using and all of the

00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:21,170
it and it looks good in everything I'm

00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,819
not saying we can't do it I'm just

00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,049
saying it that's like one of the big

00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:26,650
challenges we have with making

00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:26,650
everything smaller

00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:34,430
what I'm talking about is letting

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,240
imagemagick instead of having this

00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:42,890
raster noise effect from the yard who

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:46,820
created it instead of this get a set of

00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:49,690
rules that we artists used and let these

00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:53,089
rules be evaluated after the

00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:55,609
distribution is installed and apply

00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:58,369
those rules to waste with images then

00:51:55,609 --> 00:52:02,359
create the raster images and use them

00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:04,700
for branding yeah I like the idea let's

00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:05,990
just talk about now afterwards always

00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,630
yeah come up with some ideas for the

00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,950
walls we've got we've got some stuff

00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,980
like that already but I think it'd be

00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:15,440
nice to do more it better to stop yet to

00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,220
stop it happening because we definitely

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,220
made it too big this time

00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:26,140
any other questions aha you're too late

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,970
that's a white oh yeah Thomas

00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:32,170
enlightenment guy I was just actually i

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:33,670
just mentioned you one of the things i

00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:42,030
want to do enlightenment in the branding

00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:42,030
package but yeah any other questions

00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:53,119
ah hello hello not much of a question

00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:56,329
rather than a proposal I mean when we're

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,719
talking about market think it's usually

00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:01,609
good I think to have apartment from the

00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:05,959
generic strategy book of the public

00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:09,679
project in in marketing it would be nice

00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:11,630
to have local ones I mean yeah from

00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:15,319
country to country the mentalities

00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:18,859
different yeah we thought about that yet

00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:25,479
the the artwork team is let me go to the

00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:25,479
slide in one moment yep

00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,089
go to the artwork team they will love

00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,309
that idea I mean they're doing it

00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:35,740
already for like Greece and country so

00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:37,900
that asked them they love making new

00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,630
stuff for these different regions

00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:44,049
they're very happy to do it so I don't

00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:46,809
see us for a branding distribution

00:53:44,049 --> 00:53:48,730
perspective doing different versions of

00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:50,530
the branding in the distribution for

00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,170
different countries I think that's a bit

00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,609
too much work for us at the moment if we

00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,789
get enough volunteers from stuff like

00:53:54,609 --> 00:54:01,210
this and you know maybe for 13 to but

00:53:57,789 --> 00:54:03,910
you know not right away but for general

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:06,849
marketing artwork stuff you know you

00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:11,020
want posters you want images for blogs

00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:12,400
you want images web pages whatever those

00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,470
are you guys to speak to they will be

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,240
more than happy to help yeah that was

00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:18,609
exactly my idea not for the main just

00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,690
being bad for the for the other stuff

00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:25,270
yep yeah okay yeah there ya go that Bo

00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:30,720
if you see Carlos Oh Marcel of me I mean

00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:30,720
yeah live yep definitely good thank you

00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:37,300
ok

00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,440
well that's it then so if anyone's

00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,599
interested in actually sort of getting

00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:44,260
down and dirty with the branding package

00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:47,440
will be oh I will be in the room just

00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:50,410
across the way from twelve o'clock with

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,140
power and laptops and web stuff so in an

00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:55,089
hour's time but I have nothing else

00:54:53,140 --> 00:55:05,710
we're now so if you have no questions do

00:54:55,089 --> 00:55:08,220
you no good okay thank you very much we
