technology by Ralph laksa thank you very

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,260
much so from my side i also want to

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,029
start first with a welcome to the

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,820
opensuse conference here in Greece

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,740
wonderful place great organization i

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,840
like it very much so to all the many

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,689
people who have helped to make that

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,269
happen at that point also from my point

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:39,360
of view as a sponsor and Souza XE huge

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:42,500
of thank you for that great job done so

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,539
I was asked to do a keynote speech and

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,180
for a moment I was hesitant to even do

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,870
that why that because I'm several

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,120
persons in one okay on one hand I'm a

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,489
community member like all of you okay I

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,600
like opensuse love opensuse I use it

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,600
myself not on this laptop by the way

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,460
that's my workstation that is running

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,869
slab but on my other machine and i'm

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,970
using opensuse very frequently so i'm

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,670
part of the community and i could speak

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,580
as that I'm the vice president of

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,939
engineering for Souza and there I'm you

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,680
know my role is to try to to make sure

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,360
that all the products that Souza is

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,970
involved that includes the enterprise

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,770
product but of course opensuse and Susan

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,250
studio and all the other products are

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,380
being done in the best way they can be

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,229
done from an engineering perspective and

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,780
to what exactly our customers and in

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,310
this case the community wants from us

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,430
the last but not least I am part of the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,170
Souza executed leadership team so that's

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,360
more the business side of the house

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,850
where I have to look for numbers and all

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,340
of that stuff so what I'll try to do

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,060
today is to look at this from a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,920
community engineering VP perspective and

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,979
sometimes I'll be explicit and say you

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,079
know but from Azusa business side that

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,390
is the answer so so don't be surprised

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,149
that I'm giving different views because

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,790
I do have different things to represent

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,520
here

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:19,140
so the idea is looking a little bit

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,790
forward and by doing that a nice idea is

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,380
always to look back so I'll start

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,720
looking back a little bit how we got

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,930
here and then I want to share some

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,740
thoughts that the suze team has that I

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:47,580
personally have on how we could go from

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:51,000
here into the future so i'm in the linux

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,190
business now for twenty one year twenty

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,470
twenty-one years and I've seen all that

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,380
what i call the evolution of a linux

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,410
distribution so in your eyes this is

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,910
opensuse as a distro as an image as an

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,800
iso as an installable thing we have been

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,780
seeing a couple of changes over the time

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,300
some of you in the room might remember

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,460
we started with something very very

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,860
chaotic nobody knew how to reproduce

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,450
some people had working binaries others

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,230
didn't have them they just copied them

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,830
over so first generation just try to get

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,660
it compile and the Linux at all and work

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,790
then actually CDs came in very handy

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,710
which was great because internet

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,060
connectivity back then wasn't very fast

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:39,480
yet so Souza already was pretty advanced

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,010
at that time because we had you know iso

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,350
images which made it very easy to

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,209
install our that but of course we had to

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,030
change to distribution in several ways

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,790
then came dvds we went into the

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,250
enterprise world virtualization kicked

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,250
in imaging different form factors on how

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,540
to deliver the distribution and now we

00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,640
are in d what i call the fifth

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,920
generation of fifth phase of building a

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,860
distro where everything has to be cloudy

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,170
and adopted to the cloud and it should

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,240
be undemanding that i should follow you

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,890
everywhere and your system should never

00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:17,250
go down so quite a journey for some a's

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,440
and some B's how it all started and i

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,169
think over the time my experiences you

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,270
always have to adopt and change and it's

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:28,889
hard sometimes to predict what's coming

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:31,830
so the distro definitely changed souza

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,870
also changed so here just for you to

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,340
show a couple of different incarnations

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,680
of Sousa 1992 the logo and then Souza

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,069
still had dots back then in the name and

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,159
then it became all red then it was green

00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:48,900
again and now it's green and black here

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:51,539
this is the company logo obviously not

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,330
the opensuse logo but same thing Souza

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:56,550
also over time had had seen some

00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:03,050
evolution in some change so the question

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,050
is shall I as the geek or just as well

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:13,500
so where do we come from and this now is

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:17,340
a Suzy point of view okay so we had a

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,069
very successful box this was here is an

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,960
example 9 dot one so we will dis use the

00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,949
linux professional box it had many

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,759
cities in books in it and we try to have

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:31,229
one product for everyone so we had

00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,509
enthusiasts we had community users we

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,310
had some small business people we had

00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,050
some developers and we started to see

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,240
the first people trying to do business

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,069
with it and for all of them we had one

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,360
answer and that was the box now

00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:48,930
internally we had already done a lot so

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,960
this is a build process was all closed

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,520
was all internal called outer build but

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,969
that allowed us actually to crank these

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,520
CDs in a very efficient manner we had a

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,979
clean code base the update between suse

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,870
linux work versions worked okay most of

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,699
the stuff transition fine to the next

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,090
release especially in your home

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,699
directory and the good thing was

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,650
everybody worked on it so the situation

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,509
was there was no question shall I work

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,520
on one or the other product souza

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,960
basically had one product and that was

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,569
this so the whole engineering team

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,750
worked on that which obviously was nice

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,090
because everybody knew exactly where the

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,969
issues were and you could ping your

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,190
colleague and say hey fix that for me

00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:35,279
stuff like that but then what happened

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,960
with the internet becoming faster and an

00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,100
easy for everybody to download these

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,710
isos this I

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,590
being as free CDs and all kinds of

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,050
magazines Susie couldn't make any money

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:48,210
with it anymore so if the world would

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,240
not be about money we would still be

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,150
doing that okay that was a sentence as

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,240
an executor right I know you don't care

00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,180
that much about the money in the in the

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,090
community but we as a company I think

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,710
you understand we had to question what

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,840
what shall we do now if we can't get

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,150
anymore can't make any money out of that

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,400
people still paid a price but the

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,120
production cost was was eating all of

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:20,460
that together with the engineering costs

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:23,160
so we knew we had to change the old way

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,050
of delivering one product the box didn't

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,330
work anymore and what happened we had

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,970
enterprise customers pulling us in one

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,820
direction wanting certain stuff which in

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,390
some cases was contradictory to what the

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,060
community wanted us to do they wanted

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,610
very long lifecycles very little change

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,410
a lot of stability on the other hand

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,510
people wanted always to have the latest

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,430
and greatest and we realized it's

00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,710
impossible to do this one with one

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,710
product so we made a very conscious

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,960
decision and said okay let's make money

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,420
on the enterprise side and rather than

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,120
trying to make money with opensuse we

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,400
sponsor it so maybe this wasn't so clear

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,800
from the outside but the verse a very

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,280
conscious decision opensuse doesn't have

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,130
to make any money it is you know Souza

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,340
will always contribute to to that but

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,950
the product or the ISOs or the delivery

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,040
by itself doesn't have to make any money

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,890
so we change to a funding model where

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,560
basically of all the money that Susan

00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,040
makes a a good percentage of that goes

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,680
to opensuse and because we know that

00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,390
without opensuse we wouldn't all be here

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,610
and without the upstream projects in

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,200
general we wouldn't all be here so it

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,240
wasn't just me trying to convince

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,460
anybody or marcos rec specs then it was

00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,479
all the engineers knew that so it was a

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,479
very easy decision

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:52,460
but that was then also we also had to

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,400
change in our engineering thinking

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,790
internally because if you don't have one

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:02,060
product anymore you'll have to make sure

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,740
that if external people want to

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,120
contribute and you want to open up that

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,610
they actually have the tools and the

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,000
excess to that so we started thinking

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,790
about first of all our bill tool auto

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,250
bild was open sourced and is now known

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,620
as the open build service so that was

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,150
one of the conscious decisions that we

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,500
took we wanted to share it with the

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,560
community we wanted to work together

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,170
with the community on that and we also

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,320
had to address the release process and

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:33,320
the life cycle we wanted to have more

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,410
community say in that that the community

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,720
can steer opensuse more in their

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,420
direction rather than Sue's is saying

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,760
you know where it should go so we made a

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:49,640
conscious decision about that and we

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,250
also wanted to encourage a variety of

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,950
different opensuse flavors now why would

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,100
we don't want dead at that time we

00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:59,780
looked at other distributions and we saw

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,670
that many of these other distributions

00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,580
actually already had flavors or dare

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,680
regrets and we said if we give out the

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,890
tooling with the open build service it

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,810
is actually a great tool so let's

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,760
proactively encourage that and invite

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,050
all kinds of other communities to base

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,320
their stuff on top of opensuse that's

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,830
what we did now comes the question did

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,590
it work and I want to be very honest

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,960
here so we'll look at the good sides and

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:34,460
at the bad sides let me start with the

00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:37,070
Suze of you so this is one of the

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,400
typical now I'm executed here one of the

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,310
Suzhou slides so the commercial side of

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,020
Sousa has been very successful we have

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:48,790
all these certifications all these

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:52,210
partners to speak ecosystem so that part

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,339
spinning slee off as a separate product

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,230
definitely worked out

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:01,680
why is this important to you as I

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,459
explained that is also the money making

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,160
machine that is sponsoring opensuse and

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:09,990
I'm also here to tell you that we will

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,569
continue to do that we will continue to

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:15,120
sponsor it again talking as an executed

00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:18,089
we are all in the community with you as

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,190
developers but that's my difficult world

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,310
here speaking in with with different

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,139
messages so there is no question at the

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,940
execute of leadership team including

00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:29,880
Michael Miller and kneels and myself

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,910
that we will and that we want to sponsor

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,980
opensuse going forward and our promises

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,389
to sponsor it you know as we grow we can

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,819
sponsor it more and so a couple of lines

00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:45,480
he explained the first to actually are

00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:47,519
more the business side so we had a great

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,139
year last year so we can sponsor

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,240
actually more this year than last year

00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,250
and in some areas you're already seeing

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,759
this because we are we allowing more

00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,259
people to travel here there's more funds

00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,990
our business needs for suse linux

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,259
enterprise will also drive our funding

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:07,290
so we are now going towards slee 12 and

00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,819
what that means is actually a very

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,100
important thing to the open to the

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:15,120
community but why would you care because

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,130
we are we are basically going to work

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,310
all on the same code base so the next

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,620
opensuse releases will be the base for

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,839
sleet well've and that means that all of

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,689
engineering again we'll work together

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:31,500
with you on these opensuse releases so

00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:35,160
you'll see a lot more manpower coming to

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,920
the opensuse project the next two points

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,910
are more the heart and community member

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,220
points so as I said we are big believers

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,430
in the open source development models so

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,930
not only contributing back patches but

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,660
also making sure that the upstream

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:55,110
projects are well funded are well

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,689
supported you know giving administrative

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,170
help giving infrastructure help and that

00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:03,420
all comes very natural to us and and so

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,730
we are trying to to really help the

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,520
community here and the last but not

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,190
least every of my engineer

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,500
is a community member and as such we are

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,710
also going to continue to invest our

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,320
time into the project and we all want to

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,000
opensuse to succeed so don't don't get

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:27,180
me wrong there's no competition between

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,520
opensuse and sleeve whatsoever so that

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,930
was to sue the side of the house why

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,790
would you care let's look at the

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:38,910
opensuse side of it so this conscious

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,070
change did we actually follow through

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:44,430
did we make some changes for the

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,920
community as well I think so yes so if

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,920
you look at some of the tools we have

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,630
given provided to the community open to

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,750
the community like to build so every

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,930
Susan studio and open QA these are

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,430
examples where Souza is you know

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,740
contributing heavily bringing manpower

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,020
bringing infrastructure buying new

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,790
servers for all the great additional

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,400
contributors that we are getting on an

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,660
open souza to get the builds faster so

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,070
these are things where we are fully

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,530
committed to do and the more

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,850
contributors you get to the project the

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:21,720
more we will help you with additional

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:23,850
build power there you we so as a

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,250
community member but I would say you in

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,980
this case you really managed to get more

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,200
contributors and more packages build and

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,820
I know there's a statistics talks talk

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,720
coming coming later but the number of

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,240
contributors is growing again and also I

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,940
mean you have done great releases for 12

00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,310
2 and 12 3 in particular I've been using

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,490
both I've been looking at the at the

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,890
reviews so great job done really great

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,680
job done to all of the community I mean

00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,770
this this was was a really good release

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,290
that basically worked out of the box for

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:03,720
me and sometimes I do have some special

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:06,420
needs you have I think a very loyal user

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,910
and community based so I'm always happy

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:13,280
to see the same faces here coming back

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:16,710
the main contributors stay the same and

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,590
and we want to encourage that but I hope

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,410
you also see that Souza is trying to

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,199
open up its processes so a couple of

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,420
examples are here we want to give the

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,480
community more control this is again a

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,579
conscious decision and I hope that's

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,009
what you want at least the feedback that

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,050
I'm getting is positive so the board

00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:40,889
really should make the decisions for

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:44,519
opensuse period I mean together with the

00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,980
community of course but to me open data

00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,870
that the board is really in the driving

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,310
seat in the ultimate driving seat from

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,100
making the decisions in the technical

00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:57,360
driving seats you're all every day but

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,699
the board is kind of the the CEO of the

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,980
opensuse community if you want them and

00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:05,970
we want to empower that and we want to

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:09,509
encourage that if you look at the open

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,209
souza conference this is no longer at

00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,699
the susan location it was your choice to

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,019
go here as the community and we support

00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:19,290
you in that and we will support you in

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,420
other non choose a home-based location

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,100
if you want so that's really up to the

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,439
community decide where the opensuse

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,350
conference happens and I hope that's

00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:31,709
also what you want and then in terms of

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,769
funding we're opening up our budgets

00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:36,180
more and more to the board to make

00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,850
conscious decisions where the travel

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,939
travel funding should go how to spend

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,500
the money for merchandising or events so

00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:45,870
here we really want to give up control

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:51,350
as souza and give the control to the

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:55,380
community and that is not by accident

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:57,149
that is actually what we want to do so

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,560
our mindset and i listed a couple of

00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:03,930
things here is really we want to run

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,990
opensuse as an upstream community

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:10,289
project and that means the people who do

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,709
the work have to say very simple like in

00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:16,110
all other open source projects we will

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,150
be good citizens while active members of

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,159
course and I see a couple of big open

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,250
sources I do apologize i forgot to fix

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:27,120
that so how can use it with a lower Oh

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:29,070
Libre Office kind of food media so we

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,470
will contribute all like our patches and

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,480
I said will contribute a lot of code and

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,590
you will see that so we'll make a lot of

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,270
offers to the community

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,630
hopefully you will accept things that

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,150
we're developing towards towards future

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:47,919
Susur releases and contribute all that

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:49,600
back to opensuse and we want continue to

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,159
offer and sponsor tools to the community

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,799
so you have already seen a couple of

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,260
tools and there are more considerations

00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,630
inside souza about tools that we could

00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,700
open to the community or that would be

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:04,539
beneficial to the beneficial to the

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,360
community so that is a strong promise we

00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:08,500
will continue to do that and I just as a

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,309
keynote speaker wanted to make sure

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,340
there is no doubt about it so I said we

00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,500
wanted to look at the good sides so we

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,830
had winds on both sides on the community

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,570
side and on the Suzy company side but we

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,010
also do have challenges and people who

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,720
know me know that I want to be very

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,110
honest about everything so let's talk

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:34,000
about what did not work so well from my

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:37,120
point of view so the situation today is

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,399
we have an open souza product and we

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,590
have a suse linux enterprise product and

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:48,399
their code bases over time have have

00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:51,700
have what's the english word have

00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:54,029
diverged right so that's that's actually

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,490
a big problem for all the developers

00:18:54,029 --> 00:19:00,669
because I want as many of my guys to

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:03,070
contribute to opensuse from within their

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,200
souza job but if the code base is so

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,929
different it means out of PEG porting or

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,919
forward porting or you're not doing the

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:13,299
same work twice so that is I mean some

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,429
people might see the slide and think ah

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:17,830
it's all about business it's not so

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:20,799
there are several messages that I want

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,620
to convey to you in this slide so from a

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,539
pure engineering VP point of view the

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,080
fact that our code bases have diverged

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,120
is not good and I want to close that gap

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,929
and I want my engineers to help to close

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,490
that gap and so I'm inviting you know

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,289
these days here at the opensuse

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,320
conference is a great opportunity to

00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:43,659
invite about discussions because we

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,159
share common problems let me give you

00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,529
some examples

00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,220
on the enterprise user base we have

00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:52,239
people who want no change but the one

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,249
thing they really care about that

00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:57,190
absolutely has to be changed or in the

00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:59,470
latest version sounds very much like

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,840
tumbleweed right so the people want

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,269
something stable but in one or a couple

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,710
of areas they want the latest and

00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,119
greatest that's the area where they

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,529
develop in that's the toolkit they

00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,019
develop in or the application or

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:15,099
whatever I think you share the very same

00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,509
very same believe in the opensuse

00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:18,999
community there are people who want

00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:21,429
everything to be new granted but there

00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:23,019
are also people who want you know most

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,179
of it just to work and in a couple of

00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,669
areas they care about to to be able to

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:30,570
have them absolutely up to date so this

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:34,119
is a great opportunity to work together

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,239
with all our brains and try to think how

00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:40,539
can we solve that problem of having

00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:43,090
something very new cycling may be faster

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:45,369
than the rest of of the base combined

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,269
with the base and and engineering that

00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:51,759
in a consistent manner together

00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:54,249
contribution as I said I want more of my

00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:56,799
engineers to be able to contribute to

00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:59,109
opensuse but I said if the code bases

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,070
are so different that might mean double

00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:04,929
the work and therefore we do have you

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,419
know we don't take the maximum benefit

00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:09,789
because the code bases have have been

00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,609
gone in different directions now we'll

00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,379
come together again now what I said to

00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:17,679
what's Lee 12 will work on the same code

00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:19,419
post code base but after that we have

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,029
the risk of the same problem in happen

00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:24,210
again so we should think about it in

00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:28,809
advance and how we can avoid that

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:32,470
upgrade there are customers who actually

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:34,779
are all community members or community

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,999
users that actually want to upgrade to

00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:41,710
slee and we don't have an answer to that

00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:43,779
way so that is of course also a market

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,729
for us there is money to be made in that

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:47,499
but that's not the primary reason why I

00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:50,169
put up this slide the sliders really

00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:53,349
about the engineering gap that is a pain

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:57,190
for all of us and I think the opensuse

00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:58,820
can community can I think the opensuse

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,429
community can benefit

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,440
a lot from more souza contributions and

00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:06,019
we actually want to do that so let's

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:12,230
work together on trying to to make that

00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:14,389
work so that's the one slide with the

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:17,600
gap whenever I refer to the gap I mean

00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:19,750
that slide but there's more I wanted to

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,940
say so we also listened to your feedback

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,019
okay now looking at just opensuse so

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,889
forget about Slee and the whole

00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:30,649
enterprise world if we look at opensuse

00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:33,230
today on the one side we have factory

00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:36,080
that's the opensuse of the day i would

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:38,809
call it that's where you are always up

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,419
to date and some days it works and some

00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:44,029
days it breaks so what are the good

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,250
things about it well first of all OB s

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:49,159
rocks I think part of the success of

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,929
factory is that we have 0 PS and big

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,750
kudos to the team and the contributors

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:56,389
to OBS that made it possible to heaven

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,179
always up to date distribution and make

00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:02,659
it available also great is the

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,029
flexibility so you can really help and

00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:08,419
work together at the bleeding edge very

00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:10,309
easily in OBS and its tooling and its

00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:13,789
design really makes that easy for you to

00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:15,889
do I'm told and I can't really judge

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:18,320
this because I'm not a developer anymore

00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:19,759
to be honest the barrier of entrance of

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,769
contributing if you're a package

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,399
maintainer is actually very low so it's

00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:27,049
easy to use OBS as a package maintainer

00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,600
and then build it from multiple distros

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,600
for example or it's easy at all to get

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,789
started in building something and then

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,700
it is up to date so that definitely is

00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:41,720
the plus for factory on the downside

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:44,720
well flexibility also sucks because that

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,549
means that so many people are driving it

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,620
in so many different directions and

00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,679
somebody has to make sure that it all

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,480
integrates together or some group has to

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,600
make sure that it all integrates to get

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,330
together and that's a wholly complex

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,659
problem so by allowing the flexibility

00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,250
we are facing more integration issues

00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:06,679
then there is instability everybody who

00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:09,649
has been using factory and I used it for

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,990
some time as well now is that that you

00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,590
know it might break just the moment

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,779
before you

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,250
to do your presentation so that's why

00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:19,220
when doing the presentation I'm not

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,870
using it okay and then they are growing

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,900
pains because of the success of it

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,789
actually so we need more people who help

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,950
us a review staff integrate stuff we

00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:30,980
need more build power those are nice

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,630
problems to have by the way and Souza is

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,240
more than willing to tune to help on

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,090
these but these are also problems of the

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,460
success and then some people of course

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,340
complain now they have the latest and

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,840
greatest and now keep it and never

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,320
change it or keep it for a long time but

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,840
there is ZERO life cycle for victory if

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,220
you look at the opensuse release in form

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,720
of of the distro it is stable it has an

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,669
eight month cycle which many people

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:05,950
think is a is a good compromise it has a

00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:09,799
lot of choices so it has your favorite

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:12,890
tool of whatever kind of that you want

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,899
this is probably on there and it has at

00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:18,700
least 18 months of life cycle with

00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:21,620
security updates now it is also unstable

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,279
how can I say that well if you compare

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:27,919
it to for example w deb debian stable

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,730
and that might be more stable and you

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,039
know also older right but some people

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,659
say you know other flavors of this jose

00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,049
might be more stable yeah it's always

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,000
how you look at it eight months cycle

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,730
some people say that's the wrong cycle

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,640
to have some people say there's too much

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,590
choice I don't know linux yet give me a

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,299
mail reader give me a graphical desktop

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,460
environment I don't care which one I

00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,770
have to learn it anyway and I don't want

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,500
to look at several and then decide so

00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,870
make make a choice for me and an 18

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,710
months life cycle of course people want

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:06,610
that to be much longer more if they once

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:09,200
it's work to use it for a very long time

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,610
so that what was the feedback that we

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,500
got and we take all of that very

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,720
seriously and there are many many

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,270
discussions about that internally and

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,770
with the community and we should talk

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,429
more about this also while we are all

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:25,250
here so now I come to a couple of

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:26,140
suggestions and I call this suggestions

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,620
on purpose

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,480
because I don't want to give the

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,240
impression that Susie is imposing

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,340
anything on the community suzu should

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,260
not yes of course we are part of the

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,170
community we are a heavy contributor as

00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,820
well but I'm of the strong belief the

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:45,370
community should go where the community

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:49,420
wants to go and not where Souza is

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:52,570
trying to you know push it or whatever

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,400
so these are suggestions offers from

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,520
Souza thoughts that are going on within

00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:02,550
Souza how we could improve let's look at

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,050
factory so we are as the whole Souza

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,180
investing a lot in more automated

00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:09,820
testing and I'm more than willing to

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,220
share that with the opensuse community

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,890
and to work on that together so if we

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,980
have more automated testing will find

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,770
out breakage earlier and that will help

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,860
us to you know avoid having factory in

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,510
an unusable state ideally before the

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,530
check-in of the package or the

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,300
acceptance of the package Souza will

00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,310
increases its contribution I talked

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,710
about it towards Lee 12 you'll see a lot

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:38,020
more Susan name showing up as as

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,760
contributors people who have been busy

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,930
with the enterprise product in the last

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,400
couple of months and quarters so that is

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,260
hopefully welcomed and you will see that

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,750
and will bring a lot of stuff to

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,540
opensuse interesting new developments

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:56,070
features and and things so I think

00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:59,110
that'll increase also the value of that

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,810
we want to help in the integration

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,440
process so there are so many great

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:07,060
individual home projects in OBS there

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,510
are great things being done in

00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:13,570
tumbleweed the re integration of this

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,540
great stuff is where I think we can all

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,760
improve so making it easier for these

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,320
good things where there a couple of

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,780
people have tested that and have deemed

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,880
it better than the default to integrate

00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,960
that back and make that the new version

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,360
or the new default of something on the

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,600
release side I already talked about

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,140
bridging the gap balance quality scope

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,399
and lifecycle what do I mean with that

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,159
now

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:46,279
this is a little experience sharing from

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:49,100
me you always will have the people who

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,799
want something to be maintained very

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,340
very long and to bead of very high

00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,470
quality and they don't care whether you

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,960
know you have very little choice and

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,389
then you have other people who want a

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,190
lot of choice and if you give them a lot

00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:05,989
of choice and want to maintain that

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,470
stuff for very long time you increase

00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:11,559
your workload dramatically so I think we

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:15,259
as a community together have to decide

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:17,809
is there one right balance between these

00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:20,539
three are there are several ways of

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:23,600
doing this so maybe several variants

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:27,559
that we need to provide to to our users

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,769
here a smaller rock solid longer

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:32,929
maintained thing for example with some

00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,659
additional optional things you can you

00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:38,539
can add channels too so there's a lot of

00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:41,419
discussion and ideas around that and I

00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,159
know the Susie engineers the board all

00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:46,340
of that will entertain discussions here

00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,850
while we are all together here we are

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,970
open and flexible we as souza what the

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,789
contents of opensuse is we are also

00:29:52,970 --> 00:30:01,279
flexible when it comes to to the life

00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:03,080
cycle in so that our investment probably

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,509
will stay the same so if we go for a

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,789
smaller opensuse we can probably afford

00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:10,519
to help you maintain that stuff longer

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:12,080
and when I say we help you this company

00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,559
pay time of course the engineers are

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,200
free to help the opensuse release in

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:21,019
their free time and you know work on

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,869
longer maintenance there but not I mean

00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,509
there is then a gray zone where we enter

00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:28,460
a direct conflict with our enterprise

00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:31,009
products and I hope you can appreciate

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,029
that this is where it becomes difficult

00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:37,340
for me in my different roles and then on

00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:39,889
both sides we have improved the user

00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,739
experience or adapt to our users I think

00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:45,309
that's we really have to to listen of

00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:48,739
what people want to do so if a developer

00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:51,350
wants to use stable but complains about

00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:53,539
it being broken too often

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,190
then the developer is our user on

00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:58,309
factory and we should listen to the

00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:00,980
developer if for the release we have a

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:02,570
different kind of user with different

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,600
needs than we should listen more to them

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,130
so there is not one catch-all solution

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,640
to this and that's why we believe

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:13,309
actually the two things factory and the

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,230
opensuse release might need different

00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:17,539
rules might need different handling

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,030
different life cycle and all of that and

00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:22,190
we have some ideas about that how it

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,440
could be and we want to discuss them

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,450
openly but I'm not the right person to

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,730
do that that's that's my engineers

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,640
that's that's our teams and together

00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:36,409
with the board and an independent of

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:39,650
these two things we want to improve the

00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:43,070
transparency of our governance so to

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:46,600
give you an example review and check in

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:49,429
I just had this discussion yesterday

00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,530
people think you have to be working for

00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:54,740
Susie to become part of the review team

00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:58,370
that is not true I think one example is

00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:01,100
sitting here we wanted to work the same

00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,080
way as any open upstream process the

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,730
people who do the work and have shown

00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,010
over a period of time that they do the

00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,200
work great they should become the people

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:12,140
who have to say they are the core team

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,490
they are the you know however the

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,320
upstream come community calls it so

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:20,539
people from the outside don't seem to

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,909
realize this that Sousa thinks this way

00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,980
so we have to open up more you have to

00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:28,370
make it more transparent how you

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,940
actually come into these rods and how we

00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,950
want to govern the whole thing open

00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,659
ecosystem is another independent thought

00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:40,549
of this so Susie is fine if you know

00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:44,270
there's even a business ecosystem

00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:47,900
building around opensuse what you will

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,659
not Sue's it see is that we invest in

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:54,710
this ecosystem in the same way as we do

00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:56,750
in the enterprise world but still as a

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,280
community member I want that to be as

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,700
successful as possible because I think

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:05,100
there is lots of things where you where

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,559
you can attract additional sponsors

00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,220
tribute us is vs who want to use

00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,440
opensuse SD base for delivering to their

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:18,990
customers and we are all fine with that

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:21,059
and then last but not least we want to

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,340
allow stable and up-to-date at the same

00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:26,700
time and that's what I meant with

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,280
tumbleweed before with the tumbleweed

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,350
spirit or tumble weed problem I think

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,390
there is a lot of things where we can

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,480
share our experience where we can work

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:40,980
together and and I really want to invite

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,950
people for these discussions so to sum

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,289
it up we will continue to invest in the

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,250
project when we continue to provide

00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:51,720
tools to the community and an open us

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,440
more to grant more influence to the

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:59,640
community we will heavily contribute to

00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,740
opensuse for the you know foreseeable

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,679
future it's going to be many many

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,809
quarters actually we will help to harden

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,450
open through the factory code base

00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:12,090
because it's in our common interest not

00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,919
only for the developers so these are

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:15,780
things we will do for sure and the other

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,940
two are offers it really depends on

00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:21,210
whether you want this whether you see a

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,490
benefit in it whether the proposals we

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,649
make have to be modified in the way that

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:28,020
they make sense to you we're all open

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:30,000
for discussion here and that's this you

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,010
know how can we from engineering point

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,889
of view make it easier for the sousa

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,220
engineers to contribute to opensuse how

00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,480
can how can the open to the codebase

00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,810
benefit more from the knowledge and the

00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:47,399
bug fixes and the things that we do on

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:49,859
the others who the products and then we

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,080
want to have a discussion whether an

00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,570
upgrade path actually from opensuse two

00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,340
pseudonyms enterprise it's interesting

00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,700
for you whether you would care about

00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:03,540
this or not so this is optional because

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,270
I mean there are customer asking us for

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,310
that but I think here we need to work

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,720
together with you because we cannot do

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,869
this alone we don't want to do this

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,869
alone

00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:20,029
oops so with that I want to end with an

00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,539
invitation for more discussion and

00:35:20,029 --> 00:35:26,509
hopefully questions comments things you

00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:29,690
always wanted to ask the engineering VP

00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:32,119
or a long time opensuse community member

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,710
or an executive of Susie so I'm open to

00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,710
all questions there are no limits

00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:51,970
there's a question can we hand the mic

00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:13,200
what are the chances of souza employing

00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:18,200
more engineers to work directly on open

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:24,210
to the specific items not necessarily

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:28,040
sleep products but working on opensuse

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:33,450
focus products that could potentially

00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:36,950
feedback in to slee but initially at

00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:41,190
least it would be very much opensuse

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:44,790
focused okay so several answers to that

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,530
number one if you work on the same code

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,110
base no matter whether you think about

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,200
Slayer or not you'll think day and night

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,960
about that okay so by that alone I think

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,530
some of the people who haven't used

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,900
opensuse for a long time will will reave

00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:03,330
in there laughs for it so independent

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,940
oven you know engineering order or a

00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,710
necessity for any product they'll just

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,390
love it they'll just use it and

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,640
therefore they all contribute more so I

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,490
think that's the natural reaction that

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,820
you will see another one is a lot of

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,650
innovation we want to drive some of that

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,900
is enterprise-ready some of that is not

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,270
enterprise-ready so we always try for

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,640
innovation not only during heck week but

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,560
in general the people have time and are

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,070
given time to work upstream as well and

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,350
that is you know I think also naturally

00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,110
coming more as we work closer together

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:39,300
on the same code base in terms of

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:43,070
additional net people additional net

00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:49,500
hires for my opensuse dedicated team as

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:52,710
explained that will continue to be a a

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,950
function of the profit that souza makes

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,410
and like it or not that's just effect so

00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:01,380
I just to be very honest here so we will

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,380
grow the opensuse team as souza grows so

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,840
that i can say but you won't see 50 new

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,880
people working on it you know not

00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,400
specifically but i think you'll see a

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,180
hundred or more people working on it 200

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:23,290
more people working on it

00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:26,680
while we now work together and then

00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:29,920
maybe something else besides code so

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,450
tools integration you know these are all

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,160
generic things that our product

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,230
independent documentation best practices

00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:45,670
how to's all that kind of stuff well it

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:49,599
will also happen much more now so first

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:51,339
of all things for the dog I you complete

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,170
a lot of gaps that I had in my mind

00:38:51,339 --> 00:39:01,079
about the scissors and sister

00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:01,079
relationship so how do you think that

00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,890
that thing that you were saying that

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,970
people will be able to pass from

00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:12,730
opensuse to sue say okay hey how do you

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:15,220
have that mind it's very interesting

00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,339
it's very interesting because of my open

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,319
source a user side it's asking something

00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:22,750
like that another distribution that I

00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:24,819
find annoying but on the other hand it's

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,010
something that can be very useful to a

00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:28,569
lot of friends that I have that actually

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,270
use of and Susan want something more

00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:34,930
professional for at least one of their

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:37,270
two or three lot of so as I see it is

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,309
something that can either be very good

00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,099
and make her make the community very

00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:44,980
strong and have more hands from suzette

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:47,140
working for opensuse actually since we

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,109
will have will need to have more less

00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,510
gap between us but how exactly how

00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:54,250
exactly how do you see that let me give

00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,230
you a couple of examples where I think

00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,819
it can work very well and then we can

00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:05,200
also talk about somewhere as difficult

00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:07,690
okay so let's say 13 132 whatever comes

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,609
out as the base thusly release after

00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,680
that that's going to be an easy

00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:15,160
migration the code bases are very close

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,049
okay now i'm a developer using python

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,910
let's say that or i'm working for a

00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:20,810
little company and i'm asked to do

00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,240
something with python okay

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,220
at that time of the release the world is

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,130
great for me I can use it either in

00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:31,010
opensuse ansley it's a question do I

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,830
need to support or not then pies and

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,890
develops further and for my work I need

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:40,130
the newer version the newest stuff if

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:43,010
the newer stuff is better but backward

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:45,440
compatible it's an easy thing you know

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:48,080
then we can share it because the big

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,820
question in and the enterprise world is

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,220
it backward compatible is it breaking

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,670
any ice visas is breaking anybody's work

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:58,430
so if the newer whatever let's k python

00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:02,630
has more features more functions more

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:05,150
more more libraries around it but the

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,430
old code still runs it's an easy thing

00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,050
for us to work together on it and it

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,700
will then make it into a service pickups

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,660
leeandal making it to the next opensuse

00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:16,460
release okay colonel it's about hardware

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,220
enable meant tumbleweed is a great

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,530
example we have shown in enterprise

00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,630
product that we are able to go to new

00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,220
kernel version where some of the other

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,440
people said wow how did you do it you

00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,360
have to be careful you have to compile

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,520
some things a certain way to be able to

00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,840
do that but you can do this so while

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,390
people might think while kernel is

00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,190
probably impossible for that we can

00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,350
share the kernel or the colonel the

00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,670
hardware Nabal man stuff like that you

00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,450
know we do hardware enable meant

00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:46,970
professionally on pay for some preload

00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,040
stuff and we can and we want and we will

00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:52,520
share that with opensuse so here's

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,470
here's an easy way for you know use that

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,570
with opensuse you get some stuff and

00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,100
then you you decide now I need the

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:01,850
support or what for whatever reason you

00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:04,490
go to sleep it is easy the difficult

00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:11,330
things are complete architectural

00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:14,960
changes systemd is an example you know

00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:17,390
when we do very dramatic changes in the

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,480
base system under this draw it's going

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,570
to be very hard to impossible to do this

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,210
migration and it might be the right

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:29,270
thing to do for one or the other for the

00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,790
enterprise world or the or the opensuse

00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:34,580
world to do such a drastic change so I

00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:35,870
think I'm I'm not naive I'm

00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,340
elastic enough that there are things

00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,830
where it will not work but I think there

00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,750
are many cases and maybe Robert can talk

00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,660
a bit more about from the only is V side

00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,940
where this can work very well we're from

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,710
all the tricks and opt something in

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,600
early library part and backward

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,340
compatibility print all kinds of stuff

00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,430
you can make it work and still have the

00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,710
new end or just the new compatible or

00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:59,780
the new and the old version there and

00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,180
then you're basically tumble reading

00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,420
right so you're some things that you

00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,520
care you can jointly upgrade and both

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,530
both worlds benefit from it and we all

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,820
work to continue to work together on it

00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:17,930
way after the easley 12 really still

00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:23,930
does this make sense is there any other

00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:27,620
question will have a Christian from I've

00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:29,630
seen in some point you mentioned that

00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,600
opens Susan stable compared to other

00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:35,600
districts as debian stable how do you

00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,030
blanked stabilize it I'll be planning to

00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,710
stay late absolutely i mean everybody

00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,750
and I'm talking here as much as

00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,180
community member as anybody else once

00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,820
opensuse to be as stable as possible

00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,860
absolutely so by more testing by you

00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,590
know helping to harden it with Sousa

00:43:48,860 --> 00:44:01,640
engineering knowledge we absolutely want

00:43:51,590 --> 00:44:03,920
to make it more stable yeah I know but

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,570
like I mean I'm not I don't have our IRC

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,450
here so I hope the people on the video

00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:11,150
stream will just type it in IRC sorry

00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:14,920
I'm not Multi multi media connected here

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,920
just presentation

00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:30,660
I come from Taiwan and last year we

00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:33,900
invite use to create a convincing taiwan

00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,630
yeah so I want to ask do you have any

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,479
future pray and to promote organize the

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:45,089
opensuse user in Taiwan yeah oh no me

00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:47,400
Asia sorry I think that's the wrong

00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:50,369
question and let me tell you why so do

00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,229
you want to organize something in Taiwan

00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:55,349
yeah we are more than willing to help

00:44:52,229 --> 00:44:57,239
yeah ok so Souza is not going to pick

00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,719
the locations where there will be open

00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,880
through the conferences in the world we

00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,640
basically look for people for user

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,799
groups for maybe schools for whatever is

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,529
the carrying entity that says we want to

00:45:07,799 --> 00:45:12,829
have it and then talk to us talk to our

00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:15,900
ambassadors talk to the susan stuff and

00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:17,849
to the board and then we'll come and

00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,549
help you so that's that's how I want

00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:22,349
this to be seen not we're not making the

00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,599
call where conferences should be

00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:26,699
wherever there is enough energy and

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,269
people willing to do it we'll do our

00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:29,269
best to help

00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:44,620
anyone else thank you how they're more

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,480
questions on the chat on the IRS see I

00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,870
don't know who else is connected and

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,870
