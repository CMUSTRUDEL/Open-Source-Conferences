so good of you to join me here on this

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,469
very sunny day very sunny unlike any

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,350
other day we had here but until so far

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:19,350
actually it's fantastic here we review

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,750
her a year since since friday since we

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,260
started everybody or are you just

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,949
visiting for a day well let's get to the

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,850
presentation anyway alright um do's and

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,780
don'ts of freelancing it's basically

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,379
talked about how I run my business in

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:44,180
the Netherlands but for this occasion I

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:48,899
try to adapt to a more EU style approach

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:53,670
I hope to be able to share a couple of

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,399
concepts with you for one that having a

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,199
no having your own company I think is

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,359
absolutely the way to go why to become a

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,720
freelancer or have your own company

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,549
let's get this straight it's about money

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,090
but it's about money coming in and going

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,750
out like in this case me sponsoring this

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,630
conference so I'm afraid money is in

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,689
necessity well what is def HDR or

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:31,049
Helena's edits the company of myself and

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:33,150
my wife at this moment basically we have

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,820
registered that the goal of the company

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,009
is to deliver products and services in

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,399
just about any area we are interested in

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:49,189
which basically means a lot of IT stuff

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:51,960
events organizing and stuff like that uh

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:57,659
currently consists of two people it's my

00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:01,619
wife and myself basically I'm the one

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,960
does the most workshops but actually do

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,180
we stick to IT or something else no

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,489
because for instance i'm also the

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,259
business manager of a pascal choir in

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,970
the netherlands basically the message

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,460
i'm trying to convey here is

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,340
do whatever you are really passionate

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,280
about and try to find somebody who's

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,670
crazy enough to pay you for it up we'll

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,880
get into that later let's go the other

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,240
way all right um what do we do a lot of

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:35,250
consultancy and advice websites

00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:41,740
workshops presentations dog training

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:45,220
route coherent list right basically I

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,050
think the power of freelancers or at

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,860
least small medium-sized companies lies

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:54,670
in the fact that the diversity of the

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,740
knowledge and the inside freelancer can

00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,650
give because of the fact that he's

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,780
mostly been in a lot of situations done

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,180
a lot of projects means that he is

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,060
capable of adapting to the situation I

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,150
think that is the most the biggest value

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,410
you as a freelancer or future freelancer

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:17,440
can offer to just about any client and

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:20,680
basically that means you have to be able

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,000
to twist yourself into any kind of

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,459
interesting curve band or not but it is

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,930
rewarding well because I have only half

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,450
an hour i'm not going to tell you so

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,120
much about myself basically beauty

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,650
presentation online again but this

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,620
actually states that my current company

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,489
was simply created because of the fact

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:52,030
that we had the opportunity to do some

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,209
stuff to get some assignments in this

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,850
case my wife had a couple of projects

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,110
and here we go the company a joint

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:05,080
company was born how does that feel

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:09,910
actually well at the beginning it's a

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:12,580
bit daunting but it gets better actually

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,700
i think in the current economic

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,950
situation starting small starting as a

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,650
freelancer is makes perfect sense

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,390
because actually you can start with

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,510
simply what you have and try to work

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,810
from there basically I

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,490
think if in the current climate you make

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,560
most sort of business who will have the

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,420
idea for which they need internal

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,780
investors I think they're thinking too

00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:41,590
big I simply think that starting with a

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,120
small core activity building from that

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,040
learning from that improving that

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:52,050
experience is way more valuable than

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,530
starting big and grinding to a halt fast

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,050
the plus sides are simply that you can

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,870
do a lot of focusing on your actual

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,140
value on the value you as a person as a

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,630
freelancer can offer to accompany

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,620
instead of simply being working for

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:14,740
external issues like bank loans

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,960
mortgages stuff like that if you don't

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,390
have that kind of dependency if you

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,530
don't have that kind of pressure it

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,850
simply freeze you to do a lot of stuff

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,630
also it creates more sense of urgency

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,490
I've seen a lot of startup companies

00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,530
screw up because they had startup

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,020
investments they had a lot of people

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,580
behind them who donated money so they

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,050
could get their business started so they

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,720
thought hey my bank account full of

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,150
money right i buy a couple of nice air

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,460
books or stuff like that and all right

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,530
there's still money and after a couple

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,450
of months they discover hey now we have

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,150
a really nice company on paper but we

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:57,190
like how teeny tiny detail which our

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:59,440
customers if you do not have this sense

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,930
of urgency like you need to get

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,940
customers or client because of your

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,970
invest your startup investments the

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,920
capital you already have then I think

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,890
it's better to start small it's better

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,690
to start actually almost broke and it

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,410
also gives you a better understanding of

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,510
your own market position because

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:22,690
starting small requires you to look

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,600
around for small openings try to find

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,710
the niche that you fit in right and this

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,710
is actually a plus side

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,350
okay when not to start small if you need

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:41,230
a production facility or like shopping

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:44,690
or window space my personal idea is that

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,730
in the current situation just about

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,200
anywhere whether it be grease or the

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:54,610
Netherlands or you name it starting a

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,370
physical company like hiring offices

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:03,020
it's really not that much of a option

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:05,000
for most people but of course if you

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,770
have this brilliant idea of new products

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,770
you can always look for partners because

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,770
actually it could just be and nowadays

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,450
if you want to produce stuff with 3d

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,880
printers and so it's even possible to

00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,880
produce physical items if you have a

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:30,260
nice idea for a project find a partner

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:32,840
go for it but actually I think this is

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,900
about freelancing so I'm going to stick

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,370
to that what business models to choose

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,070
actually this is more of a legal

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,330
question because in the Netherlands you

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:46,040
have basically four models and I checked

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,890
this this is basically the same in most

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,190
EU countries you have the personal

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:57,080
purely i am the brand i am the company

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:59,120
freelancing stuff you have a small firm

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,340
perhaps with two people which is

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,290
actually the type of company i currently

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:09,080
have you can work with yeah limited

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,740
liability stock based companies which

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,060
basically mean that you sell pieces of

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,420
your company your product to other

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,730
people to invest in but this actually

00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,950
means also a lot of more paperwork and a

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,020
lot of legal stuff actually in the

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,020
Netherlands you also have to have a

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,730
starting capital to even start a company

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,250
with limited liability you have to have

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,840
like 25 thousand euros in the bank and

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,090
prove that before you can even start

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,770
that and of course you have the public

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,300
stock if you are really ambitious you

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,990
can of course start as freelancer and

00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,690
try to mow

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,200
actually I've been on until here already

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:54,040
so I'm collecting titles no I've

00:08:50,200 --> 00:09:00,780
actually stick to freelancing it's a lot

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:05,430
simpler there is only one actual reason

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,930
the big difference between the actual

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:11,200
let's say personal business like

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,570
freelancing and firms versus limited

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,360
liability is indeed the liability if you

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,570
take big projects if you do project

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,590
management with a lot of risks then

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,350
actually setting up such a construction

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,990
can make sense because if something in

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,780
this project went wrong then at least

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,970
you could like fire up the company

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,990
bankrupt the company and not get touched

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,450
yourself up until a certain extent also

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:42,070
if you're teaming up with other

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:43,780
freelancers or other companies it makes

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,540
really makes a lot of sense to actually

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,740
start a construction like that because

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,210
you will simply be protected from

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,390
financial issues from the other parties

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:58,240
which could in the first two categories

00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,610
mean that you could be personally held

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,240
accountable which I can assure you would

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,680
suck if that happens because then

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,540
actually they could like to sell your

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,430
house um let's move on here I have to

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,800
keep up the pace because of the half an

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,810
hour but if you have questions or stuff

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,200
like that please wait until the end and

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll try to answer as many as possible

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,910
let's focus again on what the objective

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,370
here is actually well how do you get to

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:36,490
that actually I'm going to work out the

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:39,220
points you see here but make a mental

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,850
note of this list and if this makes you

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,040
dizzy of the complex the stuff you have

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,830
to undertake then I think you might need

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,720
to evaluate if you really want that

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,550
company or if you simply want to say

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,800
employee somewhere but I'm going to go

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,700
into all the different

00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:04,230
points one by one here we go how does

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:08,610
that feel well to me at first right make

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:13,380
a business plan I cannot reiterate this

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:17,490
enough really making a business plan is

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,519
simply also a manner of keeping yourself

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:23,670
focused on the goal that you've set

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,810
yourself to produce being a freelancer

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:30,240
it's really easy to just react to

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:33,149
everyday circumstances and before you

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,550
know it you're six projects away from

00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:38,790
things you actually were started to do

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,589
which is not necessarily a bad thing I

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,420
mean that's like flexibility which is

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,260
possible but make the decision

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,600
consciously and actually making a

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,269
business plan is actually a good way to

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,920
also define the scope of the level of

00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:57,269
services that you want to provide at

00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,850
first in this business plan there should

00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,940
definitely be at least a rough outline

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:05,300
of the kind of client you are going to

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,740
target because being a freelancer

00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,800
actually means you have to seek your

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:13,350
market find a market you're comfortable

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,060
with find a market look for markets that

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,790
you already have some kind of

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,209
understanding of put it in your business

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:26,160
plan and your business plan also costs

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:28,440
insurance costs actually be very wary of

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,290
the monthly costs that you will have

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,990
anyway because this actually usually are

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,300
a couple of hundred euros each month

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:39,449
insurance electricity phone bills stuff

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,149
like that it's easy to oversee them

00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:44,870
because they go automatically and before

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:49,140
you know it they're more than you want

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,920
be also very very clear to yourself and

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,019
honest to yourself about which level of

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,779
which standard of living is actually

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,870
acceptable for you if you like to go on

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:03,360
holidays it's not like being employed

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,709
and getting holiday money each year or

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,850
something though you have to actually

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:13,089
band that and save that up to be honest

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,350
I've had a business for 15 years some

00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:19,899
ish by now my holidays have I think

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,410
consists altogether of maybe like two

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,720
months in those years in total I do not

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,589
mind I love it actually being here is a

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,209
holiday for me wonderful 12 but be

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,370
honest to yourself if you like going out

00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:36,940
for dinner or if you have hobbies or

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:40,660
stuff like that do not think that you

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,160
will easily give that up do not do that

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,920
anyway maintain that actually in that

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,899
same on the same page think about your

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,149
living situation do you have a partner

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,810
do you have children do you maybe one

00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:00,459
day once you have children but also do

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,009
you want to take courses do you go to

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:07,149
university do you have to pay for for

00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:09,269
anything else this is not only a money

00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:15,160
issue this is also very much a time

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:20,170
issue you have to plan this with my wife

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,689
I got this really really nice stepson he

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,660
is now nine years old he deserves

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:28,630
attention my wife also deserves

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,420
attention of course we have a couple of

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,939
dogs we have cats we have bobby's this

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,579
actually takes up and really insanely

00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:39,459
huge amount of time compared to the time

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,649
that I did not have this lucky

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:46,839
circumstance by the way which I truly

00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:49,930
love but it make sure you keep time or

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,000
you keep track of time to do that also

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,949
what's your starting point are you

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,380
employed all right that means you

00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:58,180
basically probably have a lot of time

00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,740
already spent on your employer or at

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,660
least probably you should because else

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,449
your employer would be probably pretty

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:09,990
much unhappy but if you receive like

00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:12,880
welfare then also check with the welfare

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,620
institute if there may be our special

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,410
arrangements for starting your own

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,110
business a lot of countries in the EU

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,660
actually have special programs to go

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,710
from a welfare situation to having your

00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,540
own business and

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,740
actually to some extent sponsor that

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:32,950
that is nice and defined for yourself

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,340
also as being a freelancer it could mean

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:41,740
that you could be between jobs for quite

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:43,660
considerable time watch this because if

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,200
this happens and you have to look for a

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,510
job again that also takes time so simply

00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,910
keep track of time look back at your

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:58,090
business plan a lot and you should be

00:15:51,910 --> 00:16:01,210
home free business contracts business

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,700
plan is like the rough outlines global

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,370
visions and stuff business contract is

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:10,900
actually the document in which you

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,520
exactly describe what you will do what

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,020
products do you have to you are you

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,470
going to give workshops are you going to

00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,260
give consultancy advice are you

00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,120
specifically just write it out

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,010
everything does that mean you're fixed

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,310
does that mean you're inflexible know

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:29,020
you can always change that but go from a

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,780
standard because also if you go to a

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,490
customer and he will ask you well what

00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,470
can you offer and you say well just

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:40,210
about anything that will be the shortest

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:45,130
conversation ever which will usually not

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:47,650
end up in a contract also think about if

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,480
you work with multiple people in

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,060
conjunction with other freelancers who

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,100
is allowed to represent you ooh and to

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,530
what extent I mean if you are like a

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,300
programmer and you work together in a

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,380
team of freelance programmers and you

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,720
have like a business contact be really

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,160
clear about who does what and who has

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:16,120
saying over what that is absolutely

00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:18,870
paramount be also careful with the

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:24,150
concept of liability and the current

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:29,700
economic situations clients are more

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:34,500
more yeah well detail oriented than ever

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:37,060
clients will really try to absolutely

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,570
minimize their costs and maximize the

00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,139
time you

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:45,309
as a freelancer will spend for them so

00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:49,059
and so maximize the possible exposure

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:53,320
you could have from that organize your

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:57,309
finances separate your finance streams

00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,529
between personal and business finances

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:06,759
which is also something fiscal services

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:10,120
will require next one any better feeling

00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:12,840
already or i can see release faces

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,570
everywhere terms and conditions

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,490
important part actually the first part

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,379
of the talk as you might have noticed is

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,659
about legal stuff the second part will

00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:27,600
be about how to get business actually

00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:31,960
having terms and conditions i think is

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,360
absolutely paramount because they're

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,669
only useful in case of trouble yeah

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,549
that's true and then they're fantastic

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,080
if not only being a document of like 30

00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:44,230
pages which you can hit your customer

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,549
with but also because actually you

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,919
should have described a procedure if

00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:54,360
there should be any dispute with your

00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:57,220
client how this procedure will will go

00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,360
which acts to effectively enables you to

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,190
be a control of that situation think

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,740
good about this actually most chamber of

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,110
commerce's or branch organizations and

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,990
stuff will have standard terms and

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:14,350
conditions which you can perfectly use

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:18,600
their proofread by legal advisers and

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:20,830
everything so also keep them current

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,750
absolutely important if you decide to do

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,120
other business if you decide to

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,149
certainly offer products next to

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,980
services keep your terms and conditions

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:35,529
updated or at least review them but B

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,600
also really careful not to have the

00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:40,990
paperwork take over the business but I

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,750
assure you the first period of starting

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,490
a business consists of three piece which

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,690
will be paperwork paperwork and

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:51,490
paperwork is this counterproductive nope

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:56,610
because if you've done this one

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:58,870
you love it forever at least I think so

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,360
regulated regulations in most countries

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,630
you are actually obligated by law to at

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,660
least British autumn register yourself

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,150
at a couple of institutions which mostly

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,320
our chambers of commerce fiscal services

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:19,120
and as I have experienced it's always

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,550
useful to get some kind of networking or

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,010
branch specific organization membership

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:27,190
where it alone that you could actually

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,380
refer to that membership in meetings

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,960
with a client because since freelancers

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,880
are actually pretty hard to frame but in

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,679
which products and services they offers

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,809
if you're a member of a branch

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,920
organization you can refer to that in a

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:44,770
client and also branch of organizations

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,530
do a lot of PR promotion for the

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:54,190
specific target product range you are

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:57,820
trying to offer administration my

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:03,010
favorite part no not really but you

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:06,070
should have at least some first and

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:10,330
foremost being a freelancer is really

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:12,940
attractive to keep your finances simple

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:16,510
everything in one account don't do it

00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,280
split really really split act like if

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,100
you're a multinational by the finance

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,320
process and everything be sure you know

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,020
which money belongs to your company and

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,420
which money is personal if you don't do

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:33,990
that fiscal services will have your

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:40,780
liver on toast maybe not that but still

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:43,360
actually I have some detail tips look

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:46,450
them up later because I don't want to

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,050
stop at administration but what's the

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,890
end goal to live happily and nice and I

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:58,270
think shiny paprika czar good example of

00:21:52,890 --> 00:22:02,960
nice vegetables private and business

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:08,029
costs or equity like I said

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:12,880
keeping it separate this also is a very

00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:15,230
valid for usage of items like your car

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,049
for instance you will probably use your

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:20,210
car to go to clients and go to meetings

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:22,640
or go to courses and everything in most

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:26,240
countries there are specific tax

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,390
regulations for business usage of

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,240
private vehicles this could save you a

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,940
lot of money but also it's important to

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,850
know where your equity is what where's

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:41,510
my money is it in my car I mean I own a

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:45,110
classic car which I'd like to think is

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:47,929
invaluable but still probably can be

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,230
text actually I have to thank each year

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:54,590
have I used my car mostly business or

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:58,580
private because for the fiscal year it

00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:03,909
really makes a difference if I put my

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,909
car on their personal equity or company

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:12,710
actually call fiscal services do that

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,090
ask for advice I'm not going to say

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,970
fiscal services are your friend because

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,860
that would overstate it but in most

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,570
countries they're quite helpful at least

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,940
in the Netherlands let's say like that

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:26,870
in Germany as well they're quite helpful

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:30,380
in offering advice on at least the

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,720
minimum level of detail you need to keep

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,330
in your administration and and this can

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,539
save you a lot of a lot of time because

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:41,770
if you simply form or format your

00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:44,360
administration into a format that

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,850
already is close to what the taxpayer or

00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,440
text organization wants it saves you a

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:52,340
lot of conversion time at the end of the

00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,190
fiscal year so you can use this last

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,460
point and this includes my advice I give

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,529
you here in this presentation do not

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,990
blindly take advice from friends or

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,220
relatives because they are not in your

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,720
specific situation they have their own

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,899
business they have their own own

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,940
specifics find out for yourself

00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:16,669
understand what you are doing that is

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,529
that is absolutely paramount before

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,840
in the first couple years I had a

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,549
company I would outsource my finance

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,989
administration to this company I had

00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:25,669
this really warm and fuzzy feeling that

00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:28,700
it was taken care of really nicely i got

00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:33,619
these reports it's three months and at

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:37,519
some point in time I stopped like

00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:40,100
reading them who and then I did at one

00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:44,090
point and I actually got pretty big a

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:46,429
shock at the level of mess that my

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,919
administration had become be in control

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,919
of your own administration absolutely

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:55,879
facilities think about what you need do

00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:57,980
you do you really need an office I mean

00:24:55,879 --> 00:25:00,230
most freelancers can really work from

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,669
home or if you can't work from home you

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:08,330
can probably just work from or have

00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:11,570
client meetings in hotels or other

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,850
public places think about what you

00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,210
really need if you also need like

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,190
laptops or telephones or books for that

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,919
matter you know the paper stuff also

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,539
come in electronic ways now mostly if

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:29,509
you buy them for your company their tax

00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:31,549
deductible that's good also facilities

00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:34,489
include I think a company name it's an

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:37,489
asset absolutely and you should protect

00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:41,179
it protecting the best way of protecting

00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:43,489
is simply by using it because if some

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,619
other company decides at one time that

00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:49,249
def HDR is a good name which I seriously

00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:50,749
doubt but still it might then I can

00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:55,070
always show i've been using it for 10

00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:56,899
years plus by now and in best case i can

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,629
charge money for that name that would be

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,629
nice alright

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:12,050
well insurances favorite object of every

00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:16,190
Dutch folk we have insurance for just

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:18,950
about anything it's really nice but I

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:22,100
would at least advise you to take a look

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,040
at a couple of insurances next to health

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:29,900
insurance first is legal expenses

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:33,110
insurance actually you do not control

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,660
whether a client is happy or not clients

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,910
can be a reasonable clients can be

00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,480
impossible clients can be obnoxious and

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,830
they can also be your best friend so in

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,950
the latter case everything is fine in

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,780
the former case you be really happy to

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,310
have legal expenses insurance because in

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:54,320
the general i think that the yearly fee

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:56,150
is maybe a couple of hundred euros which

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,090
actually is a couple of hours you need

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,130
from a lawyer if you ever need a lawyer

00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,920
you're going to be really happy to have

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:07,220
that insurance and trust me you will

00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,230
need it disability insurances think

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,680
about that as well I mean if you're

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:15,740
employed actually your employer has this

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:19,570
obligation by law to ensure you from or

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,950
at least pay you out if you become

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:25,190
disabled or something else nasty happens

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,500
but as being a freelancer you don't have

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:31,310
that protection you really need to

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,810
insure yourself look into that the best

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,820
thing about actually disability

00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:39,020
insurances is that they're mostly tax

00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,900
deductible income insurances some

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,900
mortgages actually require freelancers

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,350
to take insurance of income I think this

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:51,380
is pure robbery because these insurances

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:55,670
using that costs a couple of hundred

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,070
euros per month and if you read the

00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:02,150
small letters and still have no migraine

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,130
attack when you read through them you

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:06,620
will find out that they effectively will

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:13,280
never pay because they will pay unless

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:15,290
you actually have no income alright also

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,999
evaluate your existing situation like

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:20,419
mortgage and everything because

00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:24,049
mortgage specifically have fixed periods

00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:25,999
of interest changes and a couple a lot

00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,009
actually of banks charge different

00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:30,709
interest rates for freelancers and shop

00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:34,099
owners then they do for private persons

00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:37,569
who are employed so check out that and

00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:42,199
it's also really I found out there's

00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:44,359
really more than like three percent

00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:46,489
different between different mortgages

00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:48,289
and what they charge freelancers and

00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,909
whatnot and actually that that's like a

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:53,919
couple of hundred euros each month if

00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:53,919
you have at least a remotely nice house

00:28:55,089 --> 00:29:01,909
pension another thing most countries

00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,219
there is legislation which simply

00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:06,769
requires an employer to build up a

00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:10,249
pension for you as a freelancer you do

00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:12,019
not have that so actually you have to do

00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,119
that yourself but you can do that in a

00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,099
couple of different ways and actually

00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,009
that's one part I really like because in

00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:22,159
the Netherlands we have this really

00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:24,409
interesting system in which when you're

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,919
employed at a company you cannot choose

00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:31,279
you have to build up a pension at the

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:35,329
insurance company that your employer has

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,159
a contract with all right nice so if you

00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:40,339
switched up like four times or something

00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,899
you will have for different pensions and

00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,099
four different places if you're

00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,319
freelancer you don't have all that

00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:46,879
 you can do it yourself and

00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:53,989
actually what I'm doing is hungry paying

00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:56,289
my mortgage sorry in a faster than than

00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:58,879
I should because we paying my mortgage

00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,499
actually makes a lot of sense because if

00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:03,409
it's repaid I don't have to pay the

00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:06,709
interest anymore if it's repaid my home

00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:09,829
is actually my own asset which I might

00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:12,859
be able to sell if I reach the like

00:30:09,829 --> 00:30:16,879
probably 80 year threshold which it will

00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:19,789
be by that time to have a pension look

00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:23,779
into alternatives anyway look also in

00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:26,269
annuities if you have a rental home then

00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:28,940
of course paying your markets doesn't

00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:30,620
make any sense but there are usually a

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,320
couple of bank

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:38,330
products which by law in different

00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,940
countries have like text are exempt from

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,870
Texas something like that look into it

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,250
it could be really interesting all right

00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,570
like I just mentioned somewhere there

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:52,250
should be an alzheimer just to keep you

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:55,040
away how to build up a network actually

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,220
we've now reached the second part um so

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,600
glad you're still here how to build up a

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,780
network actually like I mentioned before

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,179
branch organizations not necessarily

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,370
your own branch but look them up see

00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:10,910
what's available do some research and

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:15,050
see if they organize meetings networking

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:18,320
events barbecues whatever look for

00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:20,900
customers there it's my belief and

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:24,230
experience that targeting customers

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,620
directly is effective read like five

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,600
percent or something it's it it's really

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,220
not that feasible because they get

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,300
applications from freelancers and

00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,790
companies like 10 20 times a day and

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:41,140
most likely you will not stand out but

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:43,820
if you get into the private network of

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:46,250
organizations of brands organizations

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,500
and meet customers there you have a much

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,840
nicer connection actually already to

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,080
them they don't feel pressed you can get

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,420
free advice you can simply talk to them

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,809
get to know them they will know your

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,640
name that's good actually also when

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,690
building a local network look for

00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,010
volunteer applications maybe even at the

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,320
local football club because all the

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:12,020
parents probably there are a few

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,850
business owners and simply your be doing

00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:18,860
something back for the community which

00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:22,730
is also nice also don't be afraid to ask

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,100
for help most startups have this really

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,559
nice feeling that they should do

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,360
everything because they're all grown up

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,809
boys and girls and they should be able

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,870
to manage themselves well don't be shy

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:37,550
just ask if you have a question then

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,130
poke your neighbor and ask for something

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,570
it's it's actually not that bad because

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,250
actually you are building up

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,269
relationships and that's I think what

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,399
business running as

00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:48,229
about building up relationships within

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:57,820
your own network with your clients

00:32:48,229 --> 00:33:01,039
simply try to be on the radar well

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,929
actually this pretty much sums it up

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,919
invested in network also of like-minded

00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:09,019
professionals because there will be big

00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:12,109
projects you will not be able to handle

00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:15,109
them on your own I have a network of a

00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:18,889
lot of real answers and if I have large

00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:22,820
projects I simply payroll some employee

00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:26,299
so basically make sure you have the

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,639
muscle power to also do this projects

00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:31,879
you cannot do alone because there is

00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,409
nothing worse than having to say no for

00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:36,829
a client because you're a freelancer

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:38,359
because then every piece of prejudice

00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:40,639
there is against real answers namely

00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:44,329
it's a risk there a one-man operation or

00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:52,039
women operation you need to avoid that

00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:56,359
stance also I make sure that different

00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:58,099
disciplines in your network exists one

00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:03,169
person is never able to cover all

00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:07,099
disciplines and yeah well simply I do

00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:10,279
not ever want to be cold again at like

00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:14,359
11 hours on the Friday afternoon because

00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:15,829
some client just had some leakage in its

00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,220
server room or something and it's

00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:21,079
private cloud just crashed and burned

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:23,419
I've had that too much really outsource

00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,839
it do that there are always my circus

00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:28,909
you can find who like that stuff but

00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:30,889
don't overdo it also do not try to

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:34,760
operate with like 20 different parties

00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,950
finally Bob there's not a good of fun to

00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:44,480
name here but actually in my own network

00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:46,730
there's like five actual same level type

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,579
of guys and girls who can do project

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:52,609
management who can do development I also

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:55,490
have the availability of a team of

00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:57,410
developers which I can simply upscale if

00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:59,540
project go large

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,350
also keep it manageable I mean in the

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,540
past i also had personnel at one time

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:09,500
there is this Jewish curse actually I

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:12,800
wish you a lot of personnel do not do

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,480
that please do what you like do not have

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:21,290
personnel um well how to get projects

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:27,310
most important find out where your

00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:30,950
client is hiding but basically start

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:37,310
local there are always local

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:39,610
organizations business foundations who

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,470
have yearly meetings and stuff like that

00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:45,320
go there but first investigate your

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:48,350
client register unto the fora and

00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,720
networking sites see what is actually on

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,950
the mind of your potential customer so

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,220
that you can already do some research

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,810
and be like really intelligent when you

00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,720
actually go to that BBQ and meet your

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:06,920
potential client also determine what

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,500
will be your minimal our rate do not be

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,360
tempted to compete on price because you

00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,240
do not want the label of being the

00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,190
cheapest one that is a label you can

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,260
earn once and will never get rid of

00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:23,510
again and do not even think that

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,450
starting low and going up is a valid

00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,280
option well usually you want to have

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,650
long-term relationships with your

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,250
clients to be of service and if you ever

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,050
get this client for a minimum fee yeah

00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,700
well that's what you're basically going

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,490
to get during the next few years and you

00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:45,040
you don't do that actually look at what

00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:48,530
your costs are a realistic approach and

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,020
simply divide that by the realistic

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:56,660
amount of hours that you are able to

00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:59,510
spend on actual client work and there is

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,980
not exactly a rule of thumb but I look

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,140
this up the Chamber of Commerce in the

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:08,750
Netherlands actually advises freelancers

00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:11,710
to like have a quarter of the hours or

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:13,450
at least to estimate like

00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,119
of the normal hours that you would work

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,670
as a normal employee to be actual

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:22,240
billable hours so in the Netherlands an

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,680
actual working month is 160 hours I

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,560
don't know how that's in Greece or

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,080
something but let's just keep it up 160

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,630
because it divides easily that basically

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,790
means that you get 40 hours each month

00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,349
which are basically billable the rest of

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,900
the arse you're doing research you're

00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:43,150
doing administration finance crap oh no

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:45,190
interesting things so basically sum up

00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:48,790
your costs divided them by those 40

00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:51,460
hours and see what what comes out and if

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,619
that's like 200 euros an hour probably

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:59,560
your standard of living does not suit

00:37:53,619 --> 00:38:03,310
freelancing dad fairies my hourly rate

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:08,020
varies between 70 and 100 and 10 euros

00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:10,990
an hour can we cut this out i mean this

00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:15,190
extract if you just ruined my bargaining

00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:17,830
room I need to think about this further

00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:24,730
and my branch its usual that that's the

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:26,290
cause but I know numbers all right I am

00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,200
coming towards you because of the

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:31,900
recording we used to do that in Greece

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,570
about five years ago but in our farm

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,750
years in recession in there has tents

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:40,300
quite a bit of that I feel sorry for you

00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:43,200
create more business here because

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,089
actually I believe that you can do that

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,359
but there is this little teeny tiny

00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:52,570
detail that's called reality and it's

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,609
simply you cannot change what the whole

00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,430
market is doing but I think what you can

00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:00,040
change and i think is being effective

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,490
I've trapped most freelancers easily

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,609
walk into is doing projects all over the

00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,849
place but they misjudge the travelling

00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:11,080
times that takes starting local and

00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,359
building up your network locally

00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,030
effectively eliminates travelling time I

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,420
found out to be a really valid solution

00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:22,210
of pumping up my effectively in in the

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,220
region actually I find this really nice

00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,570
in the past couple of months most of my

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,630
clients I could do

00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,160
I could visit by bike and in the

00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,980
Netherlands we're very fond of biking

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,650
but effectively that meant most of my

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:39,940
clients were in a radius of about 20 to

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:42,220
40 kilometers that is doable also here

00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,010
also start other initiatives I mean

00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:48,000
it'sit's I I'd be more than happy to

00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,710
pitch a couple ideas actually I did that

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:58,180
nice bar session yesterday evening I

00:39:50,710 --> 00:40:01,630
think also had to carry on here respond

00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:05,710
to project offerings not necessarily

00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:08,080
because you want to fulfill them or you

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,150
have time to fulfill them but to have

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:14,890
your name on the radar of possible

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:19,030
clients be in their mailing list be in

00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:22,630
their contact list and that's where your

00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,580
network comes in if for any reason this

00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,470
project might come your way you can

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,600
always suggest a colleague which also

00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,820
looks good for your client because you

00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:38,070
have still offered the solution that's

00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:40,840
good here we go beginning is always hard

00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:44,500
do not be picky in and accepting your

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,570
first projects actually take just about

00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,930
anything which makes any contribution to

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:52,420
your resume even if it's our projects of

00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,280
like three hours of work nobody on

00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:58,810
linkedin will see that it only was three

00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,090
hours also get out of your comfort zone

00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,100
but don't be too eager like if you're

00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:07,150
responding on like hundred projects each

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:10,600
time that might be an indication I think

00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:12,370
I have to just about stop how much five

00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,780
minutes alright thanks yeah I usually

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:19,510
buy a bigger laptop instead of glasses

00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,490
but if you're responding to like a

00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,470
hundred projects at the same time I

00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:28,630
think it's time to look at your basic

00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:33,070
offering it might not be optimal oh and

00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:36,040
um return favors ask for favors return

00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:38,260
favors make it a cycle that is how you

00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,830
build up your network

00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,450
and make do not make the mistake that

00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,210
handing out business cards is creating a

00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,340
network no it's not actually handing out

00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,620
business cards is nice but the only

00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,240
thing that will help you if the client

00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,560
already has an idea who you are because

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,230
this client will get like a hundred

00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,440
business cards each meeting it's

00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,210
basically just actually a technique

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,680
which worked for me I used to give

00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,920
business cards at the beginning of a

00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,780
conversation now I ask a client at the

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,870
end of a conversation would you like a

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,430
business card which mostly actually

00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:15,190
means a transaction is going to take

00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,770
place because the client will say yes

00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:20,940
apparently I want this so

00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:24,820
psychologically maybe we can do business

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:27,700
any questions I have four minutes and

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:31,420
two seconds you I will come to watch it

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:34,540
with the microphone thank you I would

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,910
like to ask you if you think that all

00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:40,030
the steps that should described are

00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,130
necessary to be taken before you even

00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,690
have an income like networking and

00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,790
subscribing the memberships and

00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,950
insurances that you don't really need at

00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,640
the start when you have no money out of

00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:54,270
your business yet short answer yes I

00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,380
think you should do that not only

00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:02,500
because know let's let's rephrase that

00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:05,050
actually it helps you to actually get an

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,000
indication of the branch area you could

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,730
be working in you don't necessarily have

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,200
to become a member directly but

00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:12,940
investigate at least the availability of

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,340
brunch organizations and stuff like that

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,890
so you get a clear picture of what your

00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,170
client where your client organizes so

00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:23,380
all the paperwork yes it should be done

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:25,210
because when you do actually get these

00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,980
clients you will not have time for all

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,110
the paperwork it's best to do it in

00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,720
front because also the paperwork helps

00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,360
you to scope and focus on your actual

00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,700
idea I think you should do as much

00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,470
upfront as possible because when you

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,820
done all that you can actually focus on

00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:46,090
your business anything else

00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:51,340
I see another question I see someone

00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:54,490
jumping up so here you go I see that you

00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:58,210
offer a diverse range of services as a

00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:01,000
freelancer how does it affect potential

00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:04,870
new customers is there a realistic risk

00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,390
that they may get confused when they see

00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:12,250
your public profile your public comment

00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:15,730
profile or does this diversity actually

00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,870
make you more attractive tube lines of

00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,810
course I think it makes me more

00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:22,270
aggressive but actually I think this is

00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,610
what happens over time if you run a

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:28,090
business the way I do to enlighten that

00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:30,340
a little bit um I've just sort of

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,190
principle that every time I have a new

00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:35,350
business model or business idea I need

00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:36,940
to find a partnership or a client to

00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,950
actually work that out with which

00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,560
effectively means i will do a lot of

00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:44,170
different things but actually did in my

00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,800
case i have not experienced that this is

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:50,380
a negative thing it actually to a client

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,480
shows that i can be flexible i can be

00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:57,610
empathic to their situation i can simply

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,950
get into a certain situation a product

00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:04,660
project or anything and absorb it and

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:08,140
offer a service actually most of my work

00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,570
at this time is being offered by clients

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:12,790
who have word of mouth advice from other

00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,130
clients for which I have done previous

00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:17,470
projects and since these other clients

00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,510
have a pretty clear image of of the the

00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,600
scope of the project that i did i

00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,970
usually get requested to do like minor

00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,890
projects and then it's just a nice plus

00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:30,070
for this new client potential client

00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:35,440
that I can also do a lot more does that

00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:37,030
answer your question ok great ok this is

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,770
one is more like a philosophical

00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,290
question there are people that say that

00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:44,020
in times of economic crisis it's the

00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:47,530
best time to start a new business where

00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:50,620
do you stand on that i have actually

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:53,440
having i'm having my fourth crisis now

00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:55,750
since i started um I actually had nine

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,050
eleven I at the dot-com crisis I had

00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:01,150
the house crisis the banking crisis and

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,520
now we're seeming to have another crisis

00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:06,030
I have never had so many customers

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,850
actually I think it's the future that

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:13,150
freelancers will be the de facto working

00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,280
force in just about any branch because

00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,910
they are flexible because for companies

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:23,470
it's easy to hire and to fire them so I

00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:28,960
think this will only get more common yes

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:32,160
cool anything else I would really like

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,160
