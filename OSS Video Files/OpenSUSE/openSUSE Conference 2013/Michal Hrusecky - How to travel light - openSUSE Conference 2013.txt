00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,610
who we are looking for we are actually

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,539
looking for people in some remote

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:55,530

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,930
don't drink coffee now okay so there's

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,870

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,260
changing because we went from and we had

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,900
some juice with our before some because

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,220
it was a huge told her remember and it's

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,409
hard to get accommodation so to the last

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,250
minute I wasn't sure whether i will be

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,310
sleeping in the office on the ground or

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,090
whether i will have some hotel so i had

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,939
to be quite prepared and also we went

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,240
for forced them so i had three notebooks

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:36,990
in my back so i was pretty packed up and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,920
when i went there some people were

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:45,030
wondering why do I have so small luggage

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,399
and I didn't consider dead small I

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,070
consider it actually pretty big because

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,369
I had to bring a lot of stuff that I

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,590
usually don't and they asked me to do

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,500
this tall I don't think that I'm really

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,270
good at struggling real light but I'm

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,840
trying to this is my luggage that I take

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,580
to hear that's my fault in each notebook

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,740

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:18,630
