Title: Konstantinos Boukouvalas - The GNU Linux knowledge certification value - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	In recent years, the promotion of GNU/Linux and FOSS but also its adoption by big companies and governmental organisations data centers, create a pressing need to ensure knowledge of the employed staff.

In this context and due to the immediate demand of specialized technicians, many suggestions for knowledge documentation on the most used system on web and e-mail server but also on LAMP solutions (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), are offered.

This presentation is reference and analysis on the causes which lead to the certification need as to the reason that Linux Professional Institute Certification (LPIC) satisfies the growing demands.

00:00:49,170 --> 00:01:01,710
Greece which represents LPI a ingress

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:08,190
from 2010 by affiliation with marvelous

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:12,090
with a Greek a panel Anika organization

and non-profit which promotes a new

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,440
linux and also new limb certification my

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,170
speech is about a new certification

00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,310
value and the connection between the l

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:32,090
pick one and CLA of course i say you

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:36,920
might know today we are going to make a

00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,920
cooperation with a huge pocket Ella's

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:52,069
okay a why to get certified linux is say

00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:57,300
about 10 years old so all these years it

00:01:52,069 --> 00:02:02,580
conquered the server and lumpy solutions

00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:08,940
in a whole internet so there is much

00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:11,629
work force the math servers main servers

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,310
and the people i'd like to demonstrate

00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:17,069
their knowledge sent a document eight

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,300
this knowledge because it's it something

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,900
different to say that I ok into this but

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,970
it's something even to can do actually a

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,960
the administration and they the handle

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,760
ago for them

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:36,100
so in general knowledge of the reasons

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:42,940
why what are actually the benefits of

00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:47,170
the pelvic certification so the three a

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:52,020
basically benefits these are described

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:59,530
also at a LPI website if you visit it

00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:03,580
it's a vendor independent so you done

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:07,960
don't have to stick on a distro ok i use

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,620
this evil ubuntu dystrophin my laptop

00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,030
which because unless a butter pecan a

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:21,070
stick or whatever whenever you want to

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:27,100
enter a and study and try to learn about

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:30,760
linux in every stroke onion we are open

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:35,710
we are open to corporations like I at

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:38,020
the past with the Ubuntu canonical there

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,870
was the bundle professionals of the

00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:45,060
station that stopped because a canonical

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:49,000
we wanted to make its own certification

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:53,700
the comptia connection and this is a

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,780
silly of course which we'd say i will

00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:01,890
discuss details later and the second is

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:07,870
that the LPI as a member of the

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,310
international training cooperation with

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:17,739
a huge list of companies like

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:24,750
hewlett-packard oracle like say and of

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:32,220
course a other prophet and not profit

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:36,790
open-source companies even with the

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:41,700
antagonists let's say red hat or even

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,700
with the evil Microsoft they are all

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,210
corporation who way to relate to a

00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:55,440
certification are members of the ITC see

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:58,630
and they discuss and grow the IT

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,889
certifications it's important to have a

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:09,220
dialogue a constant dialogue in order to

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:11,740
see where the market goes so still the

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,280
LPI is in the independent nonprofit

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,320
corporation would say has evolved out of

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:24,780
the links community and this is mirrored

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:29,380
at the exam development the exam

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,470
development is being done by the

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:37,210
community there is also a list at the

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:41,380
LPI list they'll be exam dev where you

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,620
can see it's a the most active list of

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:48,849
LBI and constantly there are settings

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,130
but what should be documented meant

00:05:48,849 --> 00:06:00,759
o'clock acknowledged like Evans

00:05:51,130 --> 00:06:04,090
knowledge on this certification so the

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:08,889
additional benefits for a professional

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:12,370
in time for his company also it's the

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:17,409
low-cost the maximum cost for the LPI

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:21,280
301 is say 230 years this is the the

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:24,099
market price the example of price of

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:32,020
course it's different it's lower it's

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:36,580
about 150 euro so this brings together

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:42,419
LPI and the community because we know

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:47,880
that many people in Linux community our

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:52,330
students are enthusiasts are a

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,460
university academic don't pop don't have

00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,880
so much money to invest on

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:05,150
a certification so we love the cost as

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:08,300
much as and then also the vouchers

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,800
through LP marketplace which is run by a

00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:16,370
piece of you the company that the

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:26,180
multisim any exams all over the world

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:30,979
including LPI exam in a better so there

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:37,669
is a huge network that you can use in to

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:40,160
take mpi test so if somebody takes a 101

00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,759
in one country can go to an exam lump in

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:49,340
the neighbor kinetic 102 and have the LP

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:52,250
quan accept this we have the example a

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,960
possibility if there is a massive

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,720
affiliate in one country like here in

00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,289
Greece yesterday they wrote on lab at

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:05,229
the Artemis same room and there was a

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:05,229
two candidates who took al pick one and

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:17,990
we a great dispenser and very like this

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:21,080
this a.m and probably we will get going

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,930
to more and more events and of course

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:30,320
there is huge in depend bibliography on

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:36,070
all levels you can find a huge resource

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:41,240
in the on the internet also ignore FDL a

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:45,410
bibliography that you can change and you

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,260
can create your own to them okay like

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,380
the one we have uploaded on a LP i

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,829
greased website from my poor poor little

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,970
a pop-out litter is a website where you

00:08:54,829 --> 00:09:02,510
can actually see the process in CSD

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:06,320
language since the educational language

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,779
I mean with the clouds and the lines all

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,810
the stuff there

00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:13,959
so there's a huge see bibliography and

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:16,930
you can so you can read them and to

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:20,589
study alone and they don't need to go to

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:31,019
some cram school and pay a pay a more

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:35,589
for education so also the the LP is a

00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:38,199
international organization a all all 6

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:43,870
photos out they promote the growth of

00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:50,499
the jobs and that soup the point after

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:53,110
all to get a job in a IT industry so

00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:56,290
this is all together without this quick

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,899
the top finder you can go to LP I do

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:04,269
talk and they see available jobs either

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:07,930
and soon I hope to have this a odesk

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:13,540
also an LP i greased website and they

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:15,339
submit jobs in aggregate industry master

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:20,470
affiliate all over the world is a

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:23,649
privilege noted m and promotion through

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,410
masterful stories they like the the

00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:32,199
recent one wherein nothing so we had the

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:35,139
the first LP k3 certified the manga

00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:39,240
racer it was a guy who urgently Tom

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:42,220
until today lpk three would say probably

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,410
10 to 10 people all over the world they

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:50,170
have this certification as it goes a

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:55,179
logical I great story only the bag rips

00:10:50,170 --> 00:11:03,179
attack guy because it worthy to be a sad

00:10:55,179 --> 00:11:10,050
story so at a the main point of this

00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:16,179
reading we are open Susan France a when

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:19,240
you tell pick one certification you

00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:21,350
automatically can fill a fall and get

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,250
the CLA certificate

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:32,320
soon a knot this knot costs or exams

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:38,120
just fill the form this great because it

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:41,600
can drive you on a path which leads path

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,280
this path you get playing with LPI and

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,050
then you can continue and be a novell

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,700
certified professional and certified

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:58,960
links engineer ain't a this I maybe are

00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:06,040
not correlated to LP I but novell and a

00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:11,260
the group that novell is a part of

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,260
promote also the l pick 3 a

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:25,490
certification taking in the they sick

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:29,450
talented administrators and an overly

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:34,250
engineers so this is very good for

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:39,350
everyone in the opposite unity because

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:45,130
they it gives a a professional path and

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,130
they're probably a top tomorrow so

00:12:49,180 --> 00:13:00,470
talking about jobs we are here also to

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:12,350
announce this great partnership with a

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:16,370
hood which came out at the third year of

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:19,330
our present rate is already and the

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:22,790
resultant ordinate will integrate more

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:32,110
the LPI certification in their

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:35,030
educational programs and promote the

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:40,300
professionalism in linux

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,300
with virus tools as the rayleigh

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:54,520
educational platform they have a two

00:13:46,880 --> 00:14:01,330
labs of course all this year for

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,330
corporate cooperation see corporate

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:09,170
partnerships so you can just go to your

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:15,550
party i want to to take an exam with for

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:21,260
FBI it's a the references about

00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:29,200
companies so if you are on a company

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:29,200
already just as a push your employer to

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:39,370
trying to have a an HP is an up pretty

00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,370
with others and

00:14:46,320 --> 00:15:02,520
let me ok so the future we talked about

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:06,890
the sleigh the jobs with a whole desk

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:12,380
and jobs probably in future with a

00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:16,920
hewlett-packard but but the lower level

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:19,590
okay we know that there are 10

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:26,280
conventional means but there are also

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:29,660
people who just now are going to learn

00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:34,740
about this operating system and then

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:39,360
they there is lack of education on a low

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:42,950
level this lack was fulfilled in 2012

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,250
with a long sir sensors a certification

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:53,580
with a basic certification for linux

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:58,910
it's like about the ecdl for linux it's

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:03,300
about theory on your own list and the

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:06,750
command line basics a basic applications

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,980
like LibreOffice and the first steps on

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:19,760
security and file permissions so this is

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:24,930
the new program of a LPI and it runs now

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:28,290
here so if you're going to take your

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:33,030
first steps in Linux and want something

and lata say that the along same state

recognized certification this is a

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:56,040
challenge this is times because of this

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,360
it's a bureaucracy we have the market

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,810

what somebody should know about

00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:16,750
computers this crazy but still it's a it

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:21,280
exists and the it's a work that has to

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,920
be done in order to promote Linux in

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,850
public administration because it's other

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,179
it's another thing to say that okay this

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:34,410
is a market certification and another

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:38,549
thing to say that the certification is a

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:51,640
paper that they can evil the right and

00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:55,750
