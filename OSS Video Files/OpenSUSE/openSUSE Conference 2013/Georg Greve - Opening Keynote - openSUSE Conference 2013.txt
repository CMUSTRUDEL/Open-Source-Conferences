believable that managed came here and a

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,819
lot grease is far away for most of you

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:21,119
welcome Saloniki first of all we finally

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,330
made it after nine months we finally

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,840
made it and I'm still standing that's

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,929
very important so some information that

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,910
i would like you to know it's a if you

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,000
need help there are people with blue

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:43,649
shirts like mine and I can help you do

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,649
everything almost everything okay we

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,800
have a beach bar outside where you can

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,050
spend your geek of money the thing with

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,620
gigamon is that you donate to the

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,250
project and once you donate 50 Cent's

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,739
you get to 1,000 eco dollars and then

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,199
you can spend it on the bar but usually

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,650
you have to have 2,000 Kiko dollars

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,560
because with 1000 key code allows you

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:16,700
don't get refreshments and most of you

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:20,900
turn to Rasmus as far as i know so i

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,049
hope that you will have a great time so

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,409

thank but I would like I would do it on

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,139
my spits because we don't have enough

00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:20,799
time to do that so ladies and gentlemen

00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,799
your grieves

00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:36,800
kalimera yeah unfortunately I other than

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,230
that it's true you all Greek to me but

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,600
good morning everyone thank you for

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,380
being here thanks to our hosts for

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,630
organizing this event quite a few of us

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,470
have been here for a few days already

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:58,200
and I guess that's for the recording and

00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,720
have experienced the the famous Greek

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,090
hospitality and much enjoyed it so thank

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,570
you very much and thank you for the

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:12,180
invitation to allow me to try to open

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:17,280
this I'll do my very best so welcome to

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,049
the convention of superheroes um I see

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,010
mostly superheroes in the room right now

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:25,230
but it's actually at the point now that

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,910
people apparently make us into action

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:39,430
figures yes I was surprised too but I

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:42,330
brought proof me

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,330
fix that

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:48,550
so well I suspect perhaps that is not

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:51,310
necessarily only about us but thanks to

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,870
a recent events I've actually decided to

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:58,240
give the whole prison disclosure is

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,840
quite the coverage in here because I

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,080
believe this is perhaps one of the most

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,030
important moments for us as a community

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:14,820
and sense of public awareness and

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:17,560
adoption of the things we do why is that

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,600
well first of all I mean in case you

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,850
have spent the past weeks under a rock

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,530
prism is the name of a secret NSA

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:33,450
program that has been disclosed by a

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:37,000
whistle-blower named Edward Snowden and

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,500
he is currently fleeing from the US

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,660
government which wasn't all that happy

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:47,220
about this disclosure and somehow this

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,500
triggered a whole avalanche of

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,540
disclosures I'm related to this which

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,440
I'll all summarize under prism anyway

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,110
because I'm ultimately now the

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,130
experience that we've made as we learn

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,930
almost every day something else about

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,330
what has been going on in terms of

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,570
governmental surveillance of the

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,520
internet and most importantly of people

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,360
somehow using the internet which

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,310
actually well is virtually anyone all

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,110
the time since we're all the time

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,480
connected to all of us carry mobile

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,490
phones with us and we leave data traces

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,170
wherever we go only that people thought

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,630
mistakenly that you know in all that

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,550
data you know the little trail that I'm

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,500
making no one could ever follow that

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,760
right it's so much data how could you do

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,160
that people apparently were thinking a

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,840
little bit in the sense of if I see all

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,289
this data I could never make sense of it

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,270
I could net

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,809
I find that one trail from that one

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,399
person to tell where they have been well

00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:53,129
guess what there's automated systems to

00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:58,839
do that and they do that very very well

00:07:53,129 --> 00:08:00,580
so prism actually enables the US

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,460
government but also other governments

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,599
and the UK has its own tempura program

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:12,490
which is quite down the same Lane um

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:16,270
it's a surveillance that is constantly

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,219
ongoing of the clouds all the cloud

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:22,719
services that are being used be it

00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:27,999
Google be it office 369 be it whatever

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:31,629
all of those cloud services are tapped

00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:34,329
into all of them and in fact when you

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:37,180
look at the legal situation here those

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:40,539
companies have to comply they must

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,180
provide access but it's also a robot

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,829
software in particular Microsoft um has

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:50,350
been actively colluding with the NSA

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,529
also most likely not fully voluntarily

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:56,649
but they have been very cooperative

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:59,139
apparently in making sure that the NSA I

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,260
always knew before anyone else about

00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:06,310
certain exploits that gets you into the

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,519
operating system on which more or less

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,449
equates to the famous windows microsoft

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,870
back door different mechanism

00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:19,089
technically speaking but in its workings

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,370
quite the same meaning the NSA can in

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:23,050
automated way break into virtually any

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,339
windows box in the world whenever they

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:31,360
touch so choose what is so concerning

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:33,010
about this I mean ok so I think most

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,370
people would agree that governments need

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:42,430
some way of tapping into information um

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:45,160
I mean there is legitimate cases I guess

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,050
that we would agree to in the sense of

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,230
there's an actual crime being committed

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:53,939
and a judge has signed off on a warrant

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:57,130
to say all right this particular person

00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:58,209
we think they're up to something bad for

00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,800
all these reasons and

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,209
judge then decides whether or not the

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,579
investigator has actually made it

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,980
sufficiently strong case to allow some

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,290
form of civilians this mechanism has

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:13,569
been working in different countries for

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:15,689
a while and more or less good depending

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:20,860
on the country nonetheless that

00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:25,389
mechanism per se exists and probably

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:28,990
should exist however this is a different

00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:31,929
thing this is everyone all the time and

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,910
without a warrant and that last part is

00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:36,069
probably the most important I mean most

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,110
of the dis duck discussion that you're

00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:41,709
currently seeing is the big tech

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,509
companies trying to say oh but it's all

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,389
been under warrant and so on and so

00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:49,540
forth you know it they're trying now to

00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:52,689
be able to disclose what they had to

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,209
disclose under warrant but none of that

00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,980
I mean it's actually nicely distracting

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:00,220
from the actual issue which is there's

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,649
been warrantless access in the US which

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,369
means no judge has ever seen this

00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:09,040
there's some guys somewhere just a small

00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:10,749
analyst at a terminal saying you know oh

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,749
I would really like to know what this

00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:16,329
person is up to and has access to this

00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,429
entire program according to what Edward

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:20,920
Snowden told us and we have no reason to

00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,699
disbelieve this and just pull that

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,339
information which might actually be as

00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:30,429
simple and the usability as a google

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,459
search and you got the whole trace of

00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:35,889
that person through all the systems um

00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:40,329
and you can then set filters to make

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:43,720
this active surveillance as well that is

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:46,299
concerning and while immediately one

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,699
would think this must be illegal I mean

00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:50,860
there's no way that it that you know

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:52,480
this should be legal ever the

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,029
interesting part here is it's fully

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,939
legal on the United States have

00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,019
legislation in place most importantly

00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:02,049
the fees are the Foreign Intelligence

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:04,299
Surveillance Act that actually makes

00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:06,790
this fully legal and it makes this fully

00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:10,029
legal not just for the purpose that is

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,300
typically being fronted as the main

00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:16,810
purpose which is you know terrorism

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,139
we need this to fight terrorists maybe

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,889
we do it's hard to tell since no one

00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,829
really has any actual hard evidence on

00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:28,810
what exactly is going on there and the

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,010
surveillance even within democratic

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:36,310
apparatus seems to be extremely lacking

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:39,190
but most importantly actually fiza makes

00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:42,399
it legal for the u.s. to do this for

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,560
political and economic goals in other

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,649
words to manipulate political process

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,459
internationally and in any country

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:53,769
outside the US and have economic

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:56,529
interference in the sense of we really

00:12:53,769 --> 00:13:00,040
prefer that boeing gets that deal and

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,779
not Airbus so let's see what we can find

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,079
out and that's legal I'm it's entirely

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:11,399
legal that is what the law says is

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:14,139
allowed to do now there's an obvious

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,360
point here that quite a few countries

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,720
are now saying oh but you know how can

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,760
this be we're friends you know but

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:29,230
frankly um this is what the United

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,870
States called the I'll politique and I

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,640
find it oddly ironic that the Germans

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:38,740
are the ones were the most surprised by

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:41,529
it but all of this is fully documented

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,540
and referenced by now and in particular

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,750
would highlight the presentation that

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,180
caspar bowden gave because he took apart

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:53,769
very well he used to work for Microsoft

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,649
by the way he took apart very well how

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:59,140
FISA empowers this kind of activity um

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:00,940
and now there's even disclosures that

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,060
perhaps this has been going on at the

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,220
NATO level so you know there's all sorts

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,050
of questions still open new disclosures

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,779
are still coming so we don't still know

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,240
the entire extent of it but of course

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,399
what this has created is a very very

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,579
strong feeling of Big Brother watching

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,920
you oh that is the feeling that a lot of

00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:23,730
people instantaneously and very strongly

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,450
good and I think that has a certain

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,540
reason I mean

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,550
I can see why that is now in theory the

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,090
u.s. program is not supposed to target

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,310
people on US soil so if you live in the

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,260
u.s. you should allegedly be safe unless

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,780
you communicate with someone from

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,440
outside the US and that's the one

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:48,040
limitation of the system um but even

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,750
that quite a few US citizens are not

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,820
quite so convinced about and I'm very

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:56,350
concerned about so we do have a a

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,530
momentum where suddenly all of this and

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,060
I mean this isn't really all that new

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,280
that's the exciting part i mean it's

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,050
we've known about quite a few of the

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,690
activities we've known about ashalon for

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,030
quite a while I mean issue also label

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,800
the conspiracy theory but you know we've

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,270
known about these things for a while but

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,440
somehow they never made the mainstream

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:22,930
media well now they do for the very

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,850
first time so first of all I mean just

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,100
to get it off our collective chest right

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,890
because we knew about this everyone

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,580
who's been in technology deep enough

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:36,340
actually you know knew that quite a bit

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,030
of this was going on um if you were at

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:46,020
all in any security context typically

00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:48,460
yes you would know um so we told you so

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:52,300
you know no one was willing to listen

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,970
but what's more important is we as a

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,900
community told people that it is

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:02,830
essential to take control of their own

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,560
IT we said it's important that you have

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:08,770
control over all the software around you

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,960
and people always had the hats not that

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,910
important you know what's the threat

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,370
scenario you know that the government

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,370
couldn't do that wouldn't do them well

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:34,199
now or like this voyage we actually find

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:41,009
ourselves in the cultural mainstream and

00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:41,009
that is actually quite important

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:10,199
and I think we need we need to sit back

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:14,010
for a second and realize suddenly we

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,350
find our issues in the mainstream while

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,230
we have been you know as a community

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,120
very strong arm talking with each other

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,760
and also talking with interested parties

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,160
outside our community all of a sudden

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,260
the very questions that we have been

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,360
raising for the past 20 30 years have

00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,440
become questions that are asked on a

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,800
broader level by more people by

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,610
communities outside our own and to me

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:48,950
that is one of the most important

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:52,010
revelations of the whole prism of debate

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:59,130
because suddenly people realize that

00:17:52,010 --> 00:18:01,020
computers are power when you see

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,450
politicians actually standing up and

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,430
saying wait a minute if you can actually

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,970
read all my email that makes it very

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:12,320
hard for me to negotiate with you on say

00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:16,560
a free trade agreement um you know

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,080
there's a certain problem here because

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,510
you know exactly how far I am willing to

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,610
go you know exactly where my cutoff

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,660
point is you can push me always all the

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,720
way to the max it's an unbelievable

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,950
advantage and I also believe actually

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,690
that this is going to be quite

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,760
interesting and since in the sense of

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,990
the global power structure and so far as

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,280
countries from the cells which are not

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,140
traditionally involved in this program

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,260
suddenly have to realize the level at

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,300
which their information has been leaking

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,150
because information ultimately is power

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,920
if you have that information if you know

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,560
what the other party is is planning

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,440
thinking what they're willing to do or

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,030
not do where is the red line what is

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,890
their main interest actually in that

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,270
negotiation if you know all of this by

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,570
the time you're sitting in the room with

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,210
them if you hear what they're discussing

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,400
with their embassy with their you know

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,370
home base to see whether the minister of

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,390
Greece or not that gives you a major

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,640
advantage

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,040
so now suddenly the whole question of

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,100
how to take control of our own

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,320
infrastructure how to take control over

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,790
the technology that we require that we

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,480
depend upon by now has become absolutely

00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:39,690
topical for virtually anyone including

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,240
also businesses I mean business secrets

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,420
are for a very good reason secret

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,040
typically you don't necessarily want

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,250
your competitor to know that you're

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,260
right now negotiating that business deal

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,970
it's not good policy you wouldn't want

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,250
them to be able to read what you have

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,100
just offered to the customer so they can

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:03,630
either up their offer or lower the price

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:08,130
or do whatever and if there is enough

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:11,030
incentive in there yes it can happen we

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,170
now we now know that so the question

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,710
really becomes for quite a few

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:21,570
businesses how do I ensure that actually

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:26,670
I am not vulnerable to this kind of

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:29,970
behavior and this really brings us back

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:35,910
to the basics of software freedom I mean

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:39,870
ultimately code is law was a very very

00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:45,120
nice summary by Lawrence Lessig and the

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:47,640
law is always codified power and if by

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,710
better access to technology or better

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,270
access to information I have more

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,160
ability to codify my advantage in

00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,530
information into international law by

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,200
the way that gives me a rather major

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,410
advantage and one that should be of a

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,120
greater concern for quite a few people

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,960
so it brings us back to the basics of

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,960
software freedom really

00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:23,130
I mean these are the principles that we

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:25,140
live by use study share improve those

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,540
are the four freedoms that make our

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,960
community that allow us to collaborate

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:34,340
and that allow us to collectively but

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:39,630
also individually take control of

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:46,800
technology we've had the answer to this

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:49,530
all along I mean this is actually the

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:56,010
answer to the entire question of what to

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:58,140
do about technology when this kind of

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,690
global surveillance is going on when

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:04,200
countries are of course trying to

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,790
protect their own interests what you

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,210
want to do then is you want to protect

00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,970
your own and actually make sure that you

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:21,330
take control and this allows you to do

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:26,400
that so effectively I think that the NSA

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:32,070
is right now helping us in a way that no

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:36,960
one ever has to tell people why it is

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:44,040
important to take control of your own

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:45,720
systems because before when you said yes

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,400
but someone could go into your computer

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,530
and could actually you know take all

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,809
that information you know pull the data

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,130
out and use it for their advantage what

00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,559
we're saying yeah but that's a

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:57,179
hypothetical scenario no one's ever done

00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:02,400
that you know show me the public

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:07,530
evidence well we have it now so in terms

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:12,780
of creating the motivation to migrate to

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:18,179
open source this is perhaps the biggest

00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:22,760
boost that we have ever gotten I mean it

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:26,179
makes the case on all levels individuals

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:28,340
businesses and governments

00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:31,999
in a way like nothing before actually

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,499
has because it demonstrates that many of

00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:35,769
the scenarios that before were

00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:39,649
considered theoretical are actually real

00:23:35,769 --> 00:23:44,570
which is fairly interesting and sites

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:45,679
like this prison break darkside have

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,480
quite the momentum they have a

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,460
substantial amount of traffic and

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:56,360
traffic from people who never ever came

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,950
in touch with us before who now say this

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,559
goes beyond what I'm willing to accept

00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,019
this is not the society I want to be a

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,879
part of and people are now starting to

00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:07,100
vote with their feet and they're trying

00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:12,379
out free software are trying out open

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:15,710
source on a scale that I don't think has

00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:20,869
existed before so i think we now have a

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:23,840
pivotal moment as a community where we

00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:27,830
actually have the attention we actually

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,200
have the attention of virtually anyone

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,419
who's following the media and i think we

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,850
should use that attention i think we

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,129
should use that moment and explain to

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:44,869
people what we have been working on and

00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:48,169
why so the motivation is clearly there

00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:51,289
in order to make sure that everyone then

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:53,299
also uses our software we need to give

00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:56,409
them the opportunity right way to make

00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:56,409
sure that they actually can

00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:13,330
and it was actually us who pointed out

00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:18,880
to me that the background here is the

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:20,890
veil of ignorance we all are typically

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,930
fairly technical which means we feel

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:28,870
very comfortable around technology all

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,990
of us I assume are unafraid of the shell

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:37,110
you know we all like text we can all

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,110
type that's all fantastic but not

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:46,650
everyone has that level of knowledge or

00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:51,370
information or even the inclination to

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:54,490
to do things in a technical way what

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,050
about the people were not technical and

00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,670
who don't really want to be technical

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,160
because they need to be something else

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,740
they need to be surgeons they need to be

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,610
lawyers they need to be whatever else I

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:10,210
mean as a society we function because we

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,760
specialized not one person can do

00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,850
everything equally well we will not

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,000
succeed as society if everyone has to do

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:22,270
everything right I mean we've evolved to

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
this level because we took certain parts

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,390
in society and we took the job that we

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,120
can do well and did it well hopefully um

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,920
and so we are the we are the tech guys

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,820
we are the people who can make computers

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,560
work but not necessarily everyone is in

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,410
that situation and the question that I'm

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,540
asking myself is and that's actually the

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,630
veil of ignorance is if I was you know

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,880
thrown into this world again with

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,700
perhaps a different skill set would I

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,060
still be able to make use of these

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,700
technologies in the same way and I think

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:07,630
the answer the honest answer for us

00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:10,510
right now still is perhaps I think we

00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:14,500
still have to do more to make it easy

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:17,230
for people to use the software we make

00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,840
we have to think as a community

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:22,480
about the fact that we don't just write

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,120
software at least I don't I mean for me

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,580
the software is not a goal in of itself

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,250
I know some people see different but I

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,770
think that software derives its value

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,380
from being used from helping someone

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,540
that that is what motivates me at least

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,910
to get up in the morning because I have

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,780
a feeling I can do something that will

00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:46,360
help other people get a job done in a

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,370
better way you know have some fun

00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,320
perhaps who knows but something that

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,830
interacts with other human beings for me

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,260
that's actually important and so we have

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:59,590
to understand that there is a long chain

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:05,169
between the person who is writing the

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:07,570
source code and all the way at the end a

00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:10,809
person who is then using this on the

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:13,570
computer um it's not like you know the

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,640
the code would magically appear on the

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,040
other end and that person would know how

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,210
to use it it would be usable fantastic

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,390
software you know it would look

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:27,429
fantastic so it's fun to use there is a

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:30,820
long long chain in there and I stole

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:33,070
this concept here um this is called the

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,410
chain of survival I think what we need

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,500
to build for ourself as a mental model

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:41,919
is something like a chain to adoption

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:45,280
and it needs to include a whole lot more

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,410
people it needs to include developers of

00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,400
course I mean without people who write

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,679
the code is kind of pointless but we

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,559
also need people who write the

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,590
documentation users we need our beta

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,950
testers we need everyone who is part of

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:05,140
a proper cycle we need support we need

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,750
entrepreneurs managers politicians even

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:11,350
decision-makers we need designers we

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,780
need artists we need them all because at

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,010
the end of the day I mean you couldn't

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:22,000
write the best piece of software ever

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:27,760
existence on this planet if there is no

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,220
support structure in place where say a

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,240
government can actually get its support

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,610
when it needs it

00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,740
we're a big company can go to say I

00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,929
really really really have this problem

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,460
here I need someone to help me out with

00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:47,170
it if that professional side of the

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:51,190
equation does not exist they can never

00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:53,020
use it because of course I mean we all

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,730
know code breaks right software always

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,120
has problems software never does every

00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,830
job perfectly well immediately so it's

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,100
all about the support structure around

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,140
it so as a community I think we need to

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,200
understand that this whole picture is

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,600
important and I think we have made huge

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,309
progress I mean we've made a massive

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,110
progress in the sense of

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:17,470
professionalizing ourselves in the

00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,929
structures from development to bring it

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,450
into the hands of users but I still

00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:26,340
think that we need to look a little bit

00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:30,730
more sometimes at the connection between

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,710
the developers and the enterprise and

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,090
that's a constant balance right we're

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,390
constantly struggling with getting that

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,420
balance right I mean I know that you

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:43,929
know Susan opensuse but also fedora and

00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:46,960
rel I mean to just to name the two very

00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:49,690
big visible examples but they exist in

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,330
smaller scales as well it's a constant

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:56,470
adjustment trying to work hand-in-hand

00:30:52,330 --> 00:31:00,490
to make sure that you can actually get

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:02,650
what someone wrote into the hands of the

00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:06,040
user because frankly most developers

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:09,580
don't even like to interact with users I

00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:13,620
mean most developers I know hate support

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:16,450
calls um so I mean as a developer

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,130
typically one should be very very happy

00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:23,710
about having the support structure in

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:25,929
the middle but for me um I think that is

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,970
where we still need to improve because

00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:29,980
we're still not quite up to the same

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:33,309
level then some other companies have

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:37,059
done this in the past not in every

00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:41,410
aspect I mean obviously we have in quite

00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:44,440
a few areas that capability down to the

00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,920
T but I think in particular and yes I'm

00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,400
going to say

00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,800
d word in particular on the desktop we

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,800
need to actually push a little bit

00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,410
further because we can it's not the

00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,810
technology anymore it's no longer the

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,000
technology it's also in the whole

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:04,600
business structure around it it's in the

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,760
entire chain from where do we enter the

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:16,510
chain to the customer that is where we

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:22,230
now also need to focus our attention but

00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:26,800
in the end I think the main message here

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:28,930
is that it actually takes everyone it

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,680
takes the suits and I dress myself up

00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:36,390
for now giving a proper keynote actually

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:39,520
and it takes the people at the keyboard

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:42,610
hacking in the code this is a community

00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:47,290
and it's a community of values whose

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:56,800
values have now actually made the

00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:58,570
headlines so in that sense I am actually

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,670
very proud to be part of this community

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:06,240
and I was very happy to be in Prague as

00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:06,240
I am now very happy to be here and so

00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,790
enjoy the conference thank you very much

00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,060
