	00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:07,259
I'm well yeah we're up welcome we took

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,660
that time because we needed some time to

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,880
bits off in that conference officially

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:19,470
and we didn't had any more time with

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:23,039
that actually so this how would I was to

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,210
actually organize this year's of ansys

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,460
conference so it started like three

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,579
years ago two years ago almost two years

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,460
ago when we went to Nuremberg three

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,370
years ago when with Newberg and we would

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,930
have had great time and then we thought

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,120
who had to do something like that and

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:49,620
the Nuremberg was amazing those guys

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,090
ticked Amazings up you were so into that

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,090
so we went for 2012 but Pratt came up

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,120
and we were not we're not feeling ready

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,680
actually solutely let's go to Prague for

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,790
this year and last year it bad although

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,490
conference there were some things that

00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,229
the people didn't want didn't know if

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,780
they are alguna an open source

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,850
conference 2013 so there were some

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,490
arguments thank God they actually agreed

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,400
that we will have that conference I hate

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,960
the psycho cincy although he's not a

00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,960
community like the typical way yeah yeah

00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:41,719
anyway so so we took the conference the

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,090
news bad news is that when we start

00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:49,140
started the whole idea of getting the

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,049
conference and this goes to some of

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,920
those guys because they were lazy to do

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:59,939
that we had more than 20 20 people that

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,479
said go ahead cost us and we are back

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,270
supporting you none of this happened

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,410
nobody supported me except Stella who at

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,599
that time production it's her very first

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,450
big thing that stood for the community

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:21,410
so I thought a bit strange about all

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:24,299
that playing out see hell because I

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,940
don't know if even that conference with

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:38,639
her the Hollywood they had the same

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:42,090
quality ain't Acosta's it's a little

00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:50,970
thing about them thanked me for putting

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:54,090
up with you button for that okay so but

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,669
we took the currents and we're

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,489
suppressing the conference everything

00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,099
artwork on rockin the wrong side who had

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,280
the perfect venue that we wanted to take

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,010
people to but when we start negotiating

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,299
with them they told us maybe marks we

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,549
can tell you when is that yeah we had

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,519
some connections that with we both

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,099
thought that it will help us but I think

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,340
the gear is that it is my pursuit the

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,530
connection we had and we planned it to

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,250
use it for the conference most of them

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,819
were not didn't happen because they

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,319
wanted other things so even though we we

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,489
thought we were prepared without

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:44,160
ourselves in rate lat thys my laptop

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:45,290
doesn't want slides so although whatever

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,129
we plant failed

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:56,170
the good thing it felt early so had a

00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:58,760
lot of time to do that what does

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,569
organizing this conference means this

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,970
means that from 11th of November which i

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,189
think is the date that toward announced

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,280
that obviously the next phase will be

00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:14,469
greased the exception of no more than 20

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:17,150
days all the other days 16 hours a day

00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,729
seven days a week and my girl can

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,009
confirm that so it's a lot of work and

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,650
it's a lot of work not because it's

00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:29,180
actually a lot of work it's it was a lot

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:33,039
of work because we had no people help ya

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,400
know this was very disappointing right

00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:41,900
eh at least not as much help as we want

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,610
to hear because people help but many

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,759
things happen to some people but they

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,800
are they generally want it to help but

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,710
another 20 people for a conference and

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,250
non-food comments saying that lets them

00:04:51,710 --> 00:05:05,289
get around by the way the promo video

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:05,289
stuff whatever you so yeah so yeah

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:16,669
that's a very big story actually if we

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,409
if you want to say stores like that we

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,020
need it Stallman tell me about nothing

00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:23,800
and then AJ to meander me and then

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:30,320
suffered all right throw me out and

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:32,270
anyway so good for organizing the

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,539
conference for me the most important

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,490
step is that you actually said very

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,680
specific time once again because it up

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,630
was that multiple era they didn't really

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,940
put that in terms of time they didn't

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,060
quantify what volunteering means and

00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,970
when they took up tasks they didn't say

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,849
okay I'm I will do this task which means

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,630
that i will be working for so many hours

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:58,529
so many days so many weeks per month and

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,829
this this was a problem

00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:03,749
this was a problem if that were over to

00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:06,259
Clark any more in detail for them it

00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:09,509
would be good to know exactly never

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,269
business so important to is that you

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:14,579
actual hands as Costa said you need to

00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,159
have people to help people to do stuff

00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:20,399
and you need to be able to delegate all

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:23,309
the stuff the rapper its report pinpoint

00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:26,189
who can do what so that you can put this

00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:28,949
person in charge of something then

00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:31,499
pretty manic delegated to volunteers

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:35,849
ideally because there is still so much

00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:38,389
work left for organizers one thing I've

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:43,739
got to say that attackers and Andy and

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:49,529
Carlos who made everything you see here

00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:54,509
from graphics Andy we miss you and get

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:57,209
your saying we miss you dude yeah and I

00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:02,610
was at that time limitation where she

00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:07,799
couldn't walk stella ba alkyl so calcio

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:09,809
yeah what else i would say sir guys i

00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:12,389
honestly don't have the brain to make

00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:18,599
presentation this the moment i want to

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:20,489
bits also oh yeah I Nina an

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,599
international conference like this when

00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,519
you have volunteering all over the world

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,069
some differences visual an issue I mean

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,799
pick up really late or early in the

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,319
morning that is and it's a bit difficult

00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:32,489
to coordinate all that and one of the

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,609
main things that will have to do in the

00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:38,699
beginning was with its application to

00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:41,969
use foreign Isaac stuff because up until

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,999
now well up until Prague we were on wiki

00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:46,349
pages and then we move to trail oh I saw

00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,199
the still people didn't really use that

00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,909
and it's important that we are all on

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,009
the same page but the tasks and how we

00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,929
use the location for tasks so that

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,999
everything goes faster and you know who

00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:59,729
is of tasks and if he's actually doing

00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:03,559
it or he hasn't started yet or if it's

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:06,869
completed and if it's completed this

00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:09,419
this completion must show it's not

00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:12,150
enough to mark the task has completed

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,910
you have to actually show the result

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,400
did you do okay this poster is completed

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,950
but where is it where can I find it and

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,920
with the source I'll having the source

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,200
files was a nightmare sometimes for me

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,750
and it's really really important because

00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,240
you can have like a minor spelling

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,370
mistake but I have to wait for someone

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,470
with Quinn a different time zone for me

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,600
to pick up and I have to find him line

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,940
while at we assess to do a spelling

00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,560
correction so it's very important to

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:47,160
have those source files yeah so let's

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,730
let's go back to the title it's a

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,820
compass without a map the tablets very

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,740
symbolic because what it means is we've

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,490
been to opensuse conferences before

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:03,810
right we went involved in the previous

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:06,180
two so we knew where we want to go what

00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:11,880
we want but I think that we think too

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:14,430
that I'm into that time that everything

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,130
was changing for many things at least

00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:20,700
into the main things change in opensuse

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,590
and most of the problems we had is that

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,490
although we knew that we had to go there

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,610
we didn't know how to that and we rate

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,830
of mystiva we had to know what steps to

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,630
do because in order to we have

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,780
everything on time although we knew that

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:39,060
it was nothing something would go wrong

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,760
and something would not be in time food

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,990
for this conference for example anyway

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:50,040
but yeah I think that we had no roadmap

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:52,920
no nobody told us you first have to make

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,960
artwork for t-shirts then you have to

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,880
have the venue then you have to I'm

00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,100
giving example it's not the if you're

00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,510
dr. Rosen said need to happen I'm tank w

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,670
so you also people happens I decided

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,860
that I don't want to drink so much

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,340
alcohol and that was a bad idea actually

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,790
so I know that's order so yeah that's

00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,380
why I give you so you will need that

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:28,750
for the first month then you will be

00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:30,670
more and more so also have in mind that

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,730
it's very important to have a woman in

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:40,959
your team because women actually see

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:43,600
things that's not guys does but also get

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,160
your table so nerdy teen so bad

00:10:43,600 --> 00:11:05,170
yeah sure sorry yes am I come under here

00:10:48,160 --> 00:11:07,620
three days they know so we actually in

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,310
the Town Hall fear made the comment that

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,470
the board wasn't involved in anything

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:20,410
you doing so you got no thanks from us

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:23,560
you got no help from mice etc how do you

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,560
see the interaction with the board and

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,000
the organizers of the conference moving

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,709
forward in the future I know this is

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,390
done but we want to learn from our

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:37,570
mistakes to ensure that going forward

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,250
things improve okay see did all the

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,730
planning to build the banning school

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,430
here all from here but allow all I want

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,910
to say it's that just to be clear right

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,890
I know that but you guys didn't do that

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,430
because you didn't want to help us it's

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,699
not that we were in that in that spot

00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,430
that we actually needed some help and we

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:03,130
needed some help and you couldn't wasn't

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,730
didn't actually know where to go to get

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:12,820
that kind of help so that was all the

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:15,459
bitching around in the butt see ya there

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,709
were individual board members that

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:20,680
helped specially in the beginning I have

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:23,860
to say Robert for example example it we

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,190
were packed with work and tasks and

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,339
there were tasks like do an announcement

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,889
right hand it to Morse not special

00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,809
people but

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,689
some very specific things not just

00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,670
general promotion and general socio me

00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:40,100
act like that and it was really time

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,049
consuming for us and we had to over

00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,889
think about this and how to ride this

00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:47,569
and my thought was that the board would

00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,369
be first of all more experience than

00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,809
doing that because she probably didn't

00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:53,749
press releases and stuff like that or

00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,699
you could more easily delegate this to

00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:57,589
someone that actually did and you could

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:01,809
coordinate it with the person that is

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:05,899
suitable to hook a teleporting and

00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:08,869
secondly well it was the board so if we

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:12,499
needed help who should we ask the board

00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:14,869
so it was our first dose I love you need

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:17,209
to be done there's been a five and there

00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:20,449
are definitely stuff that local didn't

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:24,949
will know about all that you had to to

00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:27,739
run around so yeah we wanted to delegate

00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:31,549
not the the actual tasks necessarily to

00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:34,249
the board but the coordination Bob yes

00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:36,829
because this was carved cast and maybe

00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,839
it wasn't very clear through IRC and all

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:41,119
that I'm a lot of Acts you don't

00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,069
necessarily have to do the work but the

00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:46,129
person that actually coordinates this

00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:48,559
test and make sure that the task is

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:52,009
assigned to the right person then takes

00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,499
it and make sure that someone checks the

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,749
spelling it's proof read and you make

00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:58,910
sure that if something needs their

00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:03,290
father is verified this is very very

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,139
useful and board definitely had more

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,569
knowledge on how to do stuff like that I

00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:10,939
mean I had to search for the right

00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:13,879
person I had to ask a couple of persons

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:17,959
of people until I would get the right

00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:21,199
person the things that know that whole

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:25,429
pitching on our side came out because

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,369
you have who had secondary and third and

00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:31,160
Assad anybody practical anybody could do

00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:36,709
I mean small tears brother could do that

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,829
like a when who got gear fires win who

00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,420
will just need someone focused who can

00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:47,210
speak English to do that right

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:51,830
and who even had to spend them in it

00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:56,090
decide what color of straws will have in

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:59,450
the bar and we did everything from where

00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:03,770
to put the posters from where you will

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:06,650
find taped to blue the posters from in

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,690
the venue everything is a lot but enough

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:13,760
from ours and I think is that people are

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,460
two people we we continue losing a great

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,650
percentage of time of telling again and

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,110
again because when you're doing like at

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,270
least two ND things at the same time you

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,200
lose track of most of them so we

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:30,560
consumed most most of our time in saying

00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:33,710
the same Sun and I think sometimes I

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,900
think they suffered so a sandal it mean

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:40,730
when that happened so we had no third

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,710
party to just yet just since our focus

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,530
as you are wrong here or seller you are

00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:49,490
wrong here and just make the workflow

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:52,430
you know just so we would have helped

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:56,810
then if you had as part of the

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,360
conference organizers somebody external

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,720
to Greece that could help you know

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,610
taking that how you as this manual to

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,140
improve it's like that little guy but

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:11,630
you know people in China state or

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,840
whatever can also participate in helping

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,290
to organize yes yes mostly it was that

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:24,620
but some local people should have been

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:34,160
here yeah yeah Augustine where is Hanna

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:35,660
by the way he's living in order for the

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,740
following year for the next year

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:44,930
conference I have two suggestions the

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,520
person said well it's normal when you

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,550
have people that have gone through the

00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,980
process of helping in conference and or

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,990
organizing conference it is a good idea

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,800
to send through the program for cyclic

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,360
amp answer slow

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,430
volunteers to help the the current team

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,680
that is doing the work in some key task

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,620
especially their registration to ask or

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,110
being chairman and this kind of thing so

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,600
so I would like to recommend that next

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,819
year thing about sending obvious from

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,380
the opensuse pro yet a couple of days 3

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:18,199
days in advance to give them time to

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,260
take on the ground key task or help

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,199
their local organizers to in key tasks

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,540
so i would like to see you guys next

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,760
year in dubrovnik probably two or three

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,740
days we've invested in helping the

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:35,090
logger team and the second day the

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:40,010
second thing is about is a that the

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:42,020
possible thing a lot of someone before

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:46,160
the event is to actually have the a

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:49,400
clear plan and and you got in had pork

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,600
and nori basically told exactly d or the

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,280
fact i heard this from some preferences

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,110
then things in Prague were a bit gothic

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,040
because they started south with

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,110
somewhere and he came 11 it was more

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,260
confusing than if we didn't have any

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,510
more easy because it's all got some

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,059
tribes all over yeah I think I don't for

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,309
the phone on ice or the to have some

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,169
some kind of and at least it will do a

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,970
ball on and once I've done something

00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,530
like this before and also the board and

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,179
also the people that has been helping

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,790
this year it will to be able to provide

00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:26,000
the next year organizer a clear plan of

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,040
the main tasks that we want to do and

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,880
some kind of plum the order I think that

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:34,460
it's something that as an event we as a

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,580
project we need to really provide to the

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,650
to the main organized yes and also when

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,429
you provide your agenda on who does what

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,559
obviously through the journey of

00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,550
organizing an event you will need some

00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,490
people that take care of a specific task

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:56,120
but we cannot assume that venerable

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,970
typically know who I position it's part

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,429
of the major problems you always have so

00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,340
you end up getting to the last few weeks

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:07,280
with a lot of pressure so another thing

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,570
that i would i would like to see that we

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,450
provide to the following

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:13,429
organizer its and that means that we

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,679
need commitment from people in the

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,769
project it was going to be in judge of

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,690
what so the local organizer do not have

00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:23,509
to be praying in the dancer through

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,179
mailing list or in IRC but they have one

00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:29,029
person to contact one person to come

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:31,519
just one for each part and then I manage

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:37,309
another organize themselves they wanted

00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:41,960
but just one person and also having

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:43,519
regular meetings face-to-face with those

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,990
people that are in charge of the

00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,899
Canarian something I think it's really

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,559
good to do way in advance because at

00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:53,720
some point you can adjust your workflow

00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,879
and you're working knowing that in two

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,529
weeks or in three weeks you will be able

00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:00,500
to take a decision especially once the

00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,210
decision is taken its communicated so

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,850
the rest of the people knows that that

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,500
decision was taken so from my point of

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:11,210
view having a a group of volunteers

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,779
Wayne advanced something's nothin the

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:19,070
indiv in that the knows how to do

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:24,730
keyword ground task be creating a clear

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:27,529
plan of major task play vital tax and

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,840
Valentina it's pretty neat algorithms

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:32,960
view next year things are pretty easy

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,440
because we have Trello so we have trail

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,720
already so what you do is just copy all

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,559
the tasks put it on your trailer no

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,769
honest this is very it will be very

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,200
practical see what of those tasks you

00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:51,669
just know don't need look if you change

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,990
the room names or I don't know

00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:56,659
municipality stuff with that we wrote

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,450
you throw some and you have a great road

00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,720
map to start working on you know give

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,169
people tasks and we should start making

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,309
tasks and next year we'll definitely

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:12,049
bill tell you then we did that before

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:14,779
now that we learned it's our pleasure

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,490
angry yeah and don't forget for the

00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:18,799
Trello to educate people on how to use

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:23,300
it there are a couple of things that you

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:26,640
need to specify there were some question

00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:31,980
so one thing sorry for going back to the

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,580
topic on the left but anyway sir so I

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,020
think about what I said inner is that

00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,120
regarding the boards I think that the

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,100
the board should have a discussion with

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,320
all the previous organizers about what

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,240
was needed what was not I was just I

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,920
quit they should be affiliate for the

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,500
congressman taking tasks they should do

00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,780
it borders but as there as community

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,940
members as server things that's that's

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,270
finished it's it's something that we did

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,890
anyway so let's not go there yeah and if

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,110
the board knows in advance that they

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,900
will do one two three things it is for

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,900
members to make up the time let's get 11

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,180
wait I actually have a remark regarding

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:19,680
the procedure to even become a sponsor

00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:23,250
as last year in Prague if I had this

00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,950
really inspiring talk with Kostas and

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,980
the other Greco's which were present at

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,170
the place and I simply pledged guys if

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,860
you want to do this I'll support you

00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:36,420
I'll sponsor you and I think it's

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,340
paramount for businesses to do that

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,440
anyway but I also think that on the

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,980
receiving end it could be a little bit

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,350
easier to like chips at least the

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,620
procedure in place protects to be quite

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,290
honest and i am dutch so spending money

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:56,580
is something i do not do likely but this

00:22:52,290 --> 00:23:01,380
was actually just about the hardest part

00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:03,000
ever to spent Leon that being said from

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,850
my end this has been a magical

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,310
experience I think you guys have a

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:11,430
vendetta go in order in preparing and

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:15,840
simply run I hope I will be able to be

00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:18,510
next year in in Dubrovnik I think it is

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,310
right cool I wish you much luck and I

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,890
hope you will reach the same standard

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:26,720
and may these guys inspire you they are

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,720
rock solid rock world

00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:45,510
back-to-back so so next just one say

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,850
about the sponsorship if everything well

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:52,570
this is a first edition of the user

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:57,040
conference in which we actively seek for

00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:00,910
sponsorship actively seek for

00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,130
sponsorship well we yeah we have done it

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,900
in the past but the processes we had we

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,960
needed to set up I mean before it was

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,370
done personally by one person and now we

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,710
ya mean actively see that work

00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,570
especially not accept something that had

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:18,250
two kitchens right first compatible with

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:20,530
with Susan acetylene that wanted me to

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,470
make clear here is that when I whatever

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,680
sponsors goes to the to the project it

00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:30,850
stays in the project right that that

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:34,590
internally need some some some

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:37,300
requirements to for that to happen and

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,130
the person involved the people involved

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:44,320
in the whole process it was also the

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:47,920
first time that it is and but I think we

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,190
are in good shape now to make sure that

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:57,060
the following events that the the

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:59,710
chameleon eyes and we can improve the

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,050
another process because it set up just

00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,030
at execution but especially that we have

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,030
I think we have a nice setup now for

00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:10,210
escalated for United board for more

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:14,370
people and also we have also to

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,370
understand that with the current setup

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,440
everything is define it to go through

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,570
Susan in terms of money and although we

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,570
might think that providing support to

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,580
local people for certain activities

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,860
might might be easier foreign troops

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,360
initially is not for services this one I

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,620
don't think we need to go into those

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,140
details Augustine so I mean uh so once

00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,490
again thanks to Costas and Stella's for

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,660
carrying your

00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,660
