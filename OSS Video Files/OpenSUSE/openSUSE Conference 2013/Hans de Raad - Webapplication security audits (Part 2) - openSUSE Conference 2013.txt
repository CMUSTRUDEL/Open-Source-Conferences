Description: 
	(Second part after the talk had to change rooms)

When developing and deploying web applications, the final result is a collection of software all carefully combined to offer a coherent platform.
This platform however consists of several loosely coupled items which can, on various levels, offer possibilities of manipulating the deployment.

This session offers an analysis of these items and offers some insight in the possible attack vectors these might offer.

Focus is not on actually hacking the components but on hardening them, by putting prevention measures (like mod_security) in place.

This presentation is derived from a standard auditprocedure which the author follows on a regular basis.
