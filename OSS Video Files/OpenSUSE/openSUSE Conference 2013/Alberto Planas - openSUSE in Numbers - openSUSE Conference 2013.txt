Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	In order to make good decisions we need data to support them. In the case of openSUSE, the most basic data that we can gather is the numbers of downloads in every release, the number of installations and the evolution of these numbers.

In this short talk, we will present to the community the data that we have about downloads and installations in openSUSE. This data show a clear trending in the user behavior, and is used currently to make important decisions about our future as a GNU/Linux distribution.
