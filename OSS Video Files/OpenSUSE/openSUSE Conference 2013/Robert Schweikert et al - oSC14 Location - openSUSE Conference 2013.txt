00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,630
being up the organization importance is

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,799
convinced we improv Nick probably in

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:19,770
April and so he'll be talking about the

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:22,369
location and his team and so on k is the

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,369
projector on

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:03,750
ok

00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:09,360
is that okay yeah okay cool okay so

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,810
hello everyone hello so while I'm on the

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,870
brink of alcohol what is it right they

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,130
plunge into that today I'm still sober

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,860
so I'll be able to tell you about the

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,370
conference that we hope to be able to do

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,330
is hopeless at least nearly as good as

00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:32,880
the guys needed here and of course take

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,850
a look but i forgot to say my name slip

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,090
stitch and i'm from creation from saga

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,610
and scheduling economic ill obviously

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:49,320
but i have been a long time opensuse

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,390
user so in a way this is a way i hope to

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,520
repay the community for the great work

00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:01,470
that they've been doing so that i can do

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:05,660
it existent right so as Robert on they

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,690
said it will be in April next year and

00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:13,580
it will be in Dubrovnik which if you

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,580
look at this

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:23,959
the battery's almost dead seems Julius

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:28,249
regrets the thing hope that intricately

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,849
again the colony that they have built in

00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:34,840
the area that is now dubrovnik we're on

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,370
it gardening resume from the Romans and

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,889
finally when the Slavic tribes came

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,780
there and merged all the other people's

00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:48,200
they call the Dubrovnik that's Julia or

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:54,379
first so it's I suppose it was like

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,769
fourth year for the game in terms of

00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:00,260
location it is actually very new to

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:03,439
Thessaloniki if you just fly from one

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:06,260
place to the other it's I think 400 500

00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,120
kilometers but it's not so close if you

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,040
try to go there by car so I wouldn't

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:16,099
recommend that I think it's over 10

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:21,590
hours yeah if the solid white of Croatia

00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:24,259
and so it's a bit bit far for every one

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,560
of us it's not just far for the ropes

00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:31,790
are all destroyed bottle introduce you

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,810
to the team nice my picture is missing

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:39,500
so to the team of volunteers that have

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,199
so far pledged to help with the

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:47,689
organization and I hope it won't be like

00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:51,169
what happened to your team there are two

00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:53,239
major know that 11 ish works been crazy

00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:56,419
over him Hulk which I'll tell you about

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,699
a little later but what is more

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:02,959
important is these people that I hope

00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:06,859
will will make the community broad it

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,780
first is not Google Albert he's from the

00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:11,449
Faculty of organization and informatics

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,099
in Palestine which is a smaller town

00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:19,840
north of zagreb from where I'm from he

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:24,620
fix dependent of development of software

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,949
products even wash teen is president of

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,990
Hulk he's also entrepreneur he lives in

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,320
person

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:36,640
in East row which is territory support

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,840
equation that goes ejecta is the recent

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,460
research and energy erotic where

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,260
hopefully everything will be fine with

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,520
the venues and the Catholic play there

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,410
and my me myself I'm from Zagreb and I'm

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:54,700
employed at the Faculty of Electrical

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:59,520
Engineering and computing there so in

00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,810
terms of militia are open how HR open is

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,500
Croatian Association for open systems

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,170
than the internet and how is Croatian of

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,810
abridged or adoration Linux users

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,280
association these are the in government

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,240
organizations that have been promoting

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:21,640
free software for over 22 years I think

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,040
so we have sort of tradition there and

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,520
we have been organizing our own local

00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,170
governments for 20 years which is called

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,740
those clock which means these woven

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,140
systems racialism Jesus conference this

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,350
is per team that has been involved in

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,710
rotation and volunteering gets our last

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,450
conference I will hope to have them at

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,900
least some of them in in the team for

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,600
the opensuse conference next year to the

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:55,120
right you can see even in me a little

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,980
more formal suits at the reason was at

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,820
our last conference we had the president

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:03,180
of the republic of croatia coming to to

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,340
show his board because jesus for the

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,840
conference so in terms of that we have

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,710
been relatively successful in receiving

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,380
government support from the highest

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,080
level in the recent years which i think

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,590
is a good sign but of course there's

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,320
always much room for development and by

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,830
saying a lot less mountains government

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,520
has poured a working group that would

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,850
steer the public sector in putting a

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,300
pre-shot open Technology open standards

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,409
and all baby steps for now that things

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,119
like is

00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:45,159
open system George I think really opting

00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:48,879
to raise awareness of the existence of

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:53,559
alternatives and the possibilities do to

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:56,169
develop in this area so also please let

00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:59,519
me just show you where I'm from this to

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:02,889
the left the faculty where I work at and

00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:08,559
these are few pictures of zagreb with

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:11,739
station and the main square okay so want

00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:14,709
to dubrovnik and where things will take

00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:18,339
place university of the bargaining is

00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:21,039
relatively young university they have

00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:23,619
been established in 2000 2003 as their

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,719
modern university that they are now but

00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:28,809
they have the tradition all the way back

00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:31,599
to 17th century when they had their

00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:33,759
first higher education institution

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,979
called boolean value enum established

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,599
and they they have apartments or

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:39,789
cuttings at their University and why

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,409
this whole department of agony and

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:46,689
computing department is the one that is

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:50,649
interested to collaborate and where tom

00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:52,749
za carita is actually employed so we

00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,269
expect also to have many of their

00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:57,519
students at the conference and at least

00:07:55,269 --> 00:08:01,839
dump them to volunteer and help with the

00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:05,099
organization aside from that they have

00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,379
few centers libraries Institute for

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:12,009
marine and coastal research many

00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:17,619
employees 15 daddy's undergraduate and

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:21,579
graduate and so on if you look at the

00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:24,849
map on the left these dots are the

00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:27,249
buildings of energy rom they are very

00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,669
stepping around all the way around town

00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:32,919
but it doesn't mean that they're hardly

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,349
reachable from one to another and if you

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,110
do that same thing with hotels they

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,939
would also be scared all around but if

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,339
you try walking on my bar they offer

00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:44,079
damn clear doorway to the other side it

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:49,300
will be closed 30 minutes so it all

00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:52,540
comes vegetable on foot and I think

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,700
that's a plus always for going to the

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,080
conference do

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,450
be able to easily go wherever you want

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,310
they have various the buildings are

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,470
built in various stages of development

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:11,370
but they're all very adapted to the

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,010
needs of the conference in all of them

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:18,800
so for example when diagnosed it's the

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,870
older building which on the outside is a

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,650
typical old style dubrovnik architecture

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:28,950
and on the inside it's completely

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:32,160
different it's been adapted to Europe

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,220
and the style is completely modern so

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,880
this contrast is something built impress

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:41,940
me while I was there so I hope to have

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,770
like a vast avenue because there are

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,430
things to you allied the kinetic a few

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,660
days earlier stay with one you can do

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,080
many of the things that we probably

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,110
won't be able to cover in events at the

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,300
conference it's for example the old town

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,690
is surrounded by more than two

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,210
kilometers of walls which you can

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,090
explore walk on and you can investigate

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,910
the forum also i'm done with that stuff

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,820
you can example exploited yeah there you

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:16,170
go to two museums and you can do it all

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:20,310
in what it is early avoidable you be the

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,030
hotel's horror night and others in my

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:28,410
opinion is fourth level units which is

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:33,420
five minutes from from the western city

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,510
gates it's fort where they actually in

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,860
the summer must have the open theater

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:43,770
that they have plays of Hamlet at the

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,260
walls of the fort and Sir Elton scourge

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:49,170
sit there and with my doing champ and

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,790
even with all the shooting lightning and

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,700
certain Kent night although it had been

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,480
placed where many scenes of Game of

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,670
Thrones have been filmed which is being

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,750
filmed still in various sites at

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,490
Dubrovnik you have the main street where

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,300
there are lots of shops and blood

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,910
restaurants

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,650
ours but if you go there I suggest you

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:15,510
just go into the l waiting for their

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:20,970
because prices are much much cheaper and

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:24,360
normal and they're even more exciting

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:28,910
and interesting to look at so one of the

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:33,050
things that I hope to be able to do is

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:36,390
an excursion to one without without an

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,250
area of creation which has been a

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,760
granary of Dubrovnik because of the

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,400
Great Valley that is there that's where

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,300
people go all kinds of vegetables and

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,330
fruits and where they have also a lot of

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,290
family vine yards with very famous why's

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:57,840
that have been really number for their

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,880
naughty so I think rice we could profit

00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,760
and Hemmeter there and try the local

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,280
specialties go to some of the wine yards

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,550
and have wine tasting and things like

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,500
that and so you could try all this bingo

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,830

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,520

at all the intron sets were in builded

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,840
you could go to Allah pti Galaga which

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:31,350
was also something the Greeks named i

00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,240

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,320
to pull a golem the date outram is very

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,060
little island which you can be like the

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,510

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,170
also for example lab photography you

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,610
could go to heal search which is just

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,920
above dubrovnik and the lower right

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,140

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,500
see it

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,520
so just a quick some of the plans the

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,710
venue one of the university buildings

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,900

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,390
party somewhere in town on a nice

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,890
terrace with a view of the old town into

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:29,890

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,520

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,080
expect students from the University of

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,720
Asia I haven't mentioned in others

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,120
because the only ones for which we had a

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,880
line moving flop also I know there are a

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,640
few companies that uses and opensuse in

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,080
Croatia so hopefully they will be

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,540
willing to participate at least as

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:55,270
visitors and of course I'm very hopeful

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,700
that you will share your further

00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,600
experiences the team from this year and

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,190
the rest of community and any ideas and

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,840
any guidance that you might be able to

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:10,600
to offer to help us achieve that this is

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:15,630
this goes in the right direction it

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:24,210
we're all happy with how it in the end

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:24,210
execute so yeah this is everything

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,410
you can ask me some questions but of

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:37,579
course I'm not sure it happened

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:41,259
yesterday it real easy question a area

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:44,000
some large bands I'm definitely no floss

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:47,769
no as far as the it's not in your

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,939
country it's possible I think no no no

00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:56,540
demonic is in Croatia yes no maybe a

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:59,779
third so floss kids like what next to

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,379
you like so are you planning on going on

00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:07,310
that conference is to actually I am my

00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:12,860
my opinion group is that it will be very

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:15,170
good to do that go to a near conferences

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,860
near your country and do that because we

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:21,589
have people from Albania come here so

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,959
it's it's a use the place that you are

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:27,589
making the conference unfortunately we

00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:30,170
were very lucky that point because yes

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,720
and mostly the Balkan countries are very

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,759
unlike you on that because if you

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,149
compare our countries with Germany which

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,699
in the center of Europe so just take all

00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,040
the very heart the help you can get and

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:45,920
another thing is that what helped us a

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,319
lot is go to Falls come to folsom I will

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,350
be there from definitely ok so go to

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:54,949
post them and make promotion yes I this

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,050
to my calendar my opinion is that we

00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,279
were suckers that didn't did didn't do

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:05,389
that the preview in the previous

00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:10,540
conferences ok thanks and definitely you

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:10,540
can count on us right thank you great

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:23,310
sorry i missed the start of your

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,440
presentation but can you just confirm

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,100
what the weather would be like at the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:34,410
time because course with nine eleven

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:41,230
point six percent probability it will be

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:43,780
very nice and just perfect I mean

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:48,070
probably from 15 to 20 Celsius I think

00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:49,630
some like that so it won't be good

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,300
enough to go to the beach for most

00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:55,780
people but I'll be able to walk around

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,550
in shorts and that's another of Aberdeen

00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,590
we're happy if it's in single figures

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:16,199
will go to the beach so that's fine okay

00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:16,199
great all right thank you thank you

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,320
