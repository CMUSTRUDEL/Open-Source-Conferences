Title: Bernhard Wiedemann - getting started with Raspberry Pi - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive ARMv6 based embedded device, which you can also use like a big Linux computer.
It has interfaces to attach various existing or yet-to-be-built hardware getting it on-par with Arduino.
This workshop session can be a place where people bring their Raspberry Pi and help each other to get started with it, including
- getting an openSUSE Linux image onto the SD-card,
- installing extra software in the booted system
- programming something simple with GPIOs (Bernhard brings some hardware to attach to the GPIOs)

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,030
the next visitation is about getting

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,900
starting with raspberry Pi from burnand

00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:11,900
determine whether one

00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,920
yeah welcome everyone here and it's not

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,150
really a presentation it's meant to be a

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,330
workshop hands-on to do something with

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,220
raspberry pi and one very interesting

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:45,020
thing which you don't have uh normal

00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:48,620
computers as these gpios which is the

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,480
general-purpose input/output pins you

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,010
have on your Raspberry Pi which look

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:59,809
like this and all of them are bit

00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:02,780
different like you have your power pins

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:06,470
on the top there and you have some

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,080
ground pins where the circuits we end

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,690
with electrons go and then you have your

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:19,159
GPA Oz where you can either send some

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:21,979
current or not send it or you receive

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,330
current and see this year something or

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:28,430
is there not something so you can have

00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:31,490
buttons or as a nice receivers and apart

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,060
forms if they have some alternative

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:39,290
functions for example here at gpio 14 on

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,750
the right side and 15 are can be used as

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,810
a serial console if you have the right

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,430
adapt and I have one here if you want to

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:54,590
test and for example GPO for on the left

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,170
side is a clock and this clock and tick

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,740
tick tick tick tick tick up to 500

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:04,250
megahertz which allows it to be used as

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,580
a FM radio transmitter which is a really

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,739
cool heck to do and if we have some

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,959
radio receiver around here we can try

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:17,560
that out today as well ok so that's the

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,349
hardware and we have very limited

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,409
resources like one vga connection here

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:30,620
to the projector and one monitor there

00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:33,690
for the cable so and once you real

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,700
dollar so we can maybe have

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,860
working through places so we have to

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:44,110
form some groups and do some things and

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:48,460
I brought with me some extra hardware

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:52,030
like LEDs which you could put on your

00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,690
raspberry to play with the output gpios

00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:01,090
and I have even some traffic light and

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:03,400
some cables which you can use to connect

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,850
for example to gpios to see the output

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:13,120
of one arriving as input on another and

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:24,370
play this kind of stuff okay um any

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:29,770
question so far so ah why fight omelets

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:32,980
I don't have no sorry yeah otherwise we

00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,780
could use it and work overseas age but

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,000
we have some cables I have one ethernet

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:42,040
cables here and we have one was internet

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,450
even here so and we could work a bit

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,450
with cable network here as well

00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:11,630
okay raspberry pi is a small computer

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:13,190
which can have a case or not and this

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,870
little computer does not have an

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:21,019
interview but an arm and some chip is

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,580
not just the cpu but it has its called

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,979
system ownership because it has the USB

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,229
controller and a network controller

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,740
included in some graphics function in

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,930
this one single ship and as memory on

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,050
board and you can plug in your SD card

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:41,240
in here we can put an open to the image

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:45,710
which I made for download and just also

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,690
the bootloader on here so if you do the

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,389
promising and overwrite your bootloader

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,820
you just takes SD card out put it into

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,950
your computer right image again and then

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,660
you have everything back working so it's

00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,419
a really nice thing it's very hard to

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:05,780
break and then you have these GPA opens

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:08,930
somewhere on there on one side where you

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:15,020
can connect any any hardware you can

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:21,020
think of and do a lot of cool stuff like

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:23,270
a driving motors of your 3d printer so I

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,889
you've write some software to control it

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:30,889
in and you have an audio and USB over

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:35,620
here and HDMI for the graphics to

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:39,349
connect it to some monitor or projector

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:42,560
so that's the raspberry pi it's a basic

00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,750
it got a lot of news attention so I was

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,000
thinking that most people coming to the

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:53,060
Raspberry Pi workshop know what respect

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,350
is yeah and one big advantage is it's

00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:05,900
very cheap like 40 he was at most

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:09,420
and 40 yeah and it's very little sore

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:11,640
they made it to give it to your kids so

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,670
they can play with it and if it breaks

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,720
it's not as bad as breaking us i was in

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,910
your computer and yeah it was a GPIO so

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,980
you can even do some things but you

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,880
can't do with your computer because it's

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:39,480
all you don't have these pins and the

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:42,410
functions okay so more people yeah I'm

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,380
not really sure how to organize that or

00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:49,170
maybe we can set up some raspberries

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,020
with ssh access and Q's numbers out mon

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:58,800
eat raw s'okay we can have more groups

00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:02,780
working and on something okay first

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:09,270
question who did bring em Raspberry Pi

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:14,160
143 and what did who has one I have one

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:17,820
and you have four five six so about six

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:25,400
and I have this one and we serve as well

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:25,400
so thank we are lot more than six people

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:37,020
x maybe guess so maybe five people for

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:39,000
one russ berrie which yeah now maybe I

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,360
start by showing something which I

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,490
brought so over here I have my raspberry

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,490
and I have an atom board

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,329
there is AD important i just have six

00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:10,379
leds here to greens two yellows and

00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:14,969
turrets and this is a prototype of a

00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:18,059
traffic light and I can hear on the back

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:26,209
side I have saw that each led to its own

00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:32,419
gpio output and as 168 ohm resistor

00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:32,419
which is good to change the wattage

00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:41,969
because LEDs only take two 2 volt

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,569
voltage but these gpros outputs we dot 3

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,519
volt output and so 68 ohm resistor

00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:52,370
assessing it takes to change from

00:08:47,519 --> 00:09:06,990
sweeter 322 there's even an LED

00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:12,509
calculation website which I used which

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:17,459
was it this one here and say you say

00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:20,629
okay I have my sauce water sweet of

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:28,160
three and Sid load it can take two word

00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:32,600
answer Kronus milliampere 20 and then

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,720
calculates and says okay take 60 80 so

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,899
that's what I did that's a simple part

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,439
and then I saw a little bit i'm really

00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:46,970
amateur so it looks ugly but it works

00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:51,470
and i wrote a small proof-of-concept

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,470
script to charge

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,820
so it's Aldrin micro program code so i

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,270
have not hardwired from the keyboard to

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,090
the leds but f program code in betweens

00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,600
it says if i press r and enter then it's

00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,690
red so I could script it even more to

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,760
say okay be read for 10 seconds and the

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,790
yellow follow three seconds and be green

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,280
for 30 seconds and then I would have a

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:42,470
nice traffic light maybe if they do it

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:51,230
right so that's a kind of easy things

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:59,480
you can do with a raspberry and yeah

00:10:51,230 --> 00:11:02,270
question this one is running my opensuse

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:07,400
image which you can download if you

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:09,760
search for raspberry and opensuse this

00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,760
one

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:22,950
then you find this wiki page and the

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:25,680
wiki page says here's the download of my

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:29,910
image and you download the image and use

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:36,030
gzip and DD to put it on your SD card as

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:41,520
a rock raw raw image yeah so it's

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:44,960
opensuse and it's a factory version

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:50,550
that's not updated at the moment but

00:11:44,960 --> 00:12:01,970
it's very close to 12 3 and so it's

00:11:50,550 --> 00:12:01,970
pretty stable most of the time okay so

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,520
how to continue and knee proposals

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,310
yeah if you have an SD card or with your

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:25,889
raspberry that you don't mind over

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:28,680
writing you can flash it oh yeah no no

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,720
we want to get you going here with

00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,470
opensuse on the Raspberry Pi that's

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:42,630
purpose so you can do more at home or

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:46,829
later so who wants two flashes SD card

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:51,600
for this raspberry pi you yeah do you

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:58,110
want to flash you SD card okay so do it

00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:10,319
yourself okay good I on my laptop but I

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:12,480
would have to boot it up so okay good or

00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:24,750
do you already have opensuse on your SD

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:27,779
cards yes no no sponsor okay and it's a

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,569
very minimalistic image I have to say so

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,269
there's a super on it so I can install

00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:35,880
more software but there's no yes for

00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:39,290
example so you have to do at super

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,310
install just to dish network if you want

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,310
yes module two exam

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:23,450
okay who already has opensuse on his

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:26,870
raspberry hmm yeah do you have opened I

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,990
know who who of you has opensuse unless

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:34,370
raspberry already you have or wants to

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:41,320
have it on his ass sorry oh not yet

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:41,320
nobody 10 ah you want to okay

00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:46,429
maybe

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,570
yes

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,860
inside

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,360
where

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:08,340
something

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,340
maybe give me the pulse of play

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,230
thank you

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,220
suppose the plate number breaks

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,220
I

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,560
you

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,100
hello mystic

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:52,680
test okay you got a great microphone

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,680
with few pickles so okay

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,810
ok i could only one

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,340
I only one theory is a good once you

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:38,230
know drama which is over there no but I

00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:41,649
guess you can set up ssh for you for ten

it's not accept this is so the beauty

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,679
page is it from

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:12,720
so is your power cable long enough to

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:12,720
get them okay

something but yes that's easily yeah it

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:40,750
was nudity on linux at least yeah I'm

not sure about Meg yeah but not d feste

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:49,770
something on me it's so this device as a

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:53,679
different funds yet did he yes but diff

00:28:49,770 --> 00:29:06,150
his death is the zone a certain place

00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:13,600
name I guess yes image but to where yeah

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:15,700
yeah that's a wonderful sink means or

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:22,240
make sure that all the data is written

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:25,000
out yeah like if you have you to turn

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,850
your machine heart of then you want to

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,850
do a simple for to make sure that all

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:35,309
the data is on the file system if it can

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,309
be but yeah shutdown is even better

00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:48,960
yeah yeah some reason it okay let's

00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,369
maybe I get even more reason I cables

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,909
and then you do have is a nettle yeah

00:29:53,369 --> 00:30:07,279
okay yeah so we just need to make sure

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:07,279
about the IP configuration no date dhcp

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:23,220
you could or we configure some static IP

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:27,229
reason it's not too hot yeah you can

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,229
even add it to tier by its owner SD card

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,690
yeah

00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:49,790
okay so any questions not much to see

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:53,230
right no kick so over there the housing

00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:58,010
working already on this money truck

00:30:53,230 --> 00:31:00,580
here's Chucky already flashed yeah just

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,580
before

00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:33,360
yeah maybe I fetch know it could fetch

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:59,130
us a Syria consult on there and so we

00:31:33,360 --> 00:32:01,680
could just use Syria yeah console sorry

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:08,300
and can be Boris the Syrian to informant

00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,300
yeah okay

00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:19,669
okay no kids interest yeah just baked

00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,669
some

00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:53,680
no that's just for seeing what happens

00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:56,910
so kondal serial console was a received

00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,920
Lyla transmitted line integral line and

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,480
hence the flashing Jeffers SD card and

00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:07,720
you can put the SD card in your computer

00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:12,160
as the card we had yeah yes that's the

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,800
idea and if you break it you just take

00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,760
out to SD card and ken utley flesh it or

00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:23,410
modify it so that it works again yeah

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:25,440
now it would search let's see if it

00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,440
works

00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,220
kids

00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:58,159
ah let's bored

00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:16,200
yeah where the keyboard as a new don't

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,200
mean to Syria

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:40,840
yeah so you are

00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,840
now we can set up IP networking

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:05,700
what I 9930 is this night it has a lot

00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:08,120
of natick okie swear what did you hear

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:12,100
no no

00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,100
yep but that's a 4 big-ip

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,880
okay so it seems the last week I gets an

00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:36,830
automatic IP address if it does not get

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:39,860
an DHCP response which is yes 99 dot 38

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:48,530
which was what way what I had in my home

00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:51,160
network so it kept animated nature and

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,160
by nine

00:35:53,999 --> 00:36:04,469
okay and then you just pour it up as it

00:35:57,459 --> 00:36:04,469
imagine ok take some time

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:27,730
okay uh-huh I hope you guys are not too

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:30,070
bored okay hope it goes away and you did

00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:39,160
not know before who's going to be

00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:44,260
watching ah no it's pretty much a psych

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:47,290
project of mine so so is the part in the

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:51,730
works or is it working it's mostly

00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:54,190
working and currently we are rebuilding

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,950
everything for um b6 which is the actual

00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:01,210
raspberry platform but the image i had

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:04,720
for now as my wife so that order runs or

00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:10,210
more different systems too and also

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:13,140
unless been I look forward to moving

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,140
away from rusty

00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:25,770
so many many I tonight Azusa it's not

00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,550
too bad of course was focusing so our

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:37,140
master is getting new platform so can be

00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:40,230
a problem it's did always like that when

00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:44,100
you innovate yeah the new stuff as

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:48,800
always well you've seen how some people

00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,800
have done some work done and not only

00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,420
its evolutionary like you start small

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,420
and thank you

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,789
simplicity so just I think we can borrow

00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:34,140
the co-founders premier can't see to

00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:39,069
hear to work with the comes back that's

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:41,799
excusable nah nah you have your monitor

00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,589
sir sure she did for cable get let's not

00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:47,609
needed so you wanna t yeah we need it

00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,609
for this one

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:26,950
and maybe no first let's first artists

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,980
here comes or so that we see what is

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,980
happening

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,400
so I'll stop

00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,890
let's do oops

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,960
some herbs which is betrayed

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:35,450
what is it boot it but some houses here

00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:37,869
comes Oh Brock no no it's just try the

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,869
network

00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,250
make the cable yourself

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:41,380
have you have network connection to the

00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:41,380
raspberry yep yeah should be possible

00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:52,500
ah yes I beat me no no no let's run it

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,750
takes some time because there's no

00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:01,070
reverse dns lookup yeah okay I translate

00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,720
half a minute I needs to time of the DNS

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:07,860
he wants to know who is connecting and

00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:27,870
write it into this lock fight so it will

00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:35,940
take it on top and then maybe you want

00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:39,460
SATA or do you have a jeep our dish

00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:55,370
which the power cable

00:42:39,460 --> 00:43:04,120
yeah hmm let's try and pink which was a

00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:04,120
pink again Oh netbook is done some o

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,380
samsung happened

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:28,490
it was it was dark for a second do you

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:35,750
have some self it's not over ssh now but

00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:40,030
director was severely ifconfig yes no

00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:46,370
but you could if you have internet what

00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:50,830
chick's a network so it's not work but

00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,830
it Troy

00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:56,319
ditched

00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:09,559
yeah but there's no network it's offline

00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:18,059
yeah you you could configure to send

00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:25,079
your network over your machine to the

00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:27,119
wireless but it's a bit difficult no

00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:40,069
coach does not work over Bareilles not

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:54,690
well no way now maybe you can do it ok

00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:56,910
to do a human one to process ipv4 no

00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:03,620
foxes net type

00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:13,620
five before want so forwarding and

00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:24,570
iptables in that tree routing source 1 &

00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:32,210
2 & 6 80 something output on soon target

00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:32,210
pass great ah not table

00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,630
and

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,460
ah- always bad

00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,050
ah you don't have a map here

00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:32,940
I think your network manager running

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:32,940
maybe not good okay maybe not

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,440
it's an for schooling

00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,820
now you are routing Network fire yeah I

00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:08,300
mean yeah you know over ethernet over

00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:15,500
ethernet through wireless okay so no in

00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:19,359
the city for gateway yeah with put your

00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:23,210
new spirit listen it may be asked

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:28,730
upstair or ask the organization they

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:31,820
have some having you need two different

00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:38,180
address and then it's automatically the

00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:47,690
default gateway and now we can do bring

00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:50,350
it to the Internet no pings open no URL

00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,350
to the rescue

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:13,830
let's pick this IP and some working so

00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:19,140
maybe trace crude we have trace hotel

00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:19,140
and trace with minus n maybe

00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,540
so this wanna switch but something

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,870
I

00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,880
Oh No

00:48:44,390 --> 00:49:16,770
sinks I beat able to administer it's

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:27,600
good I must be no wont be a graphic

00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:32,180
novel established routine intercessions

00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,180
or less we must hurry

00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:45,520
okay King does not go through ah gives

00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:48,870
azusa firewood I guess yeah okay then we

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:51,870
need to a lot I can take the sins at

00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,870
fault

00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:44,339
like you thank you yeah so it's a bit

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:48,450
tricky ah yeah i think you have network

00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:55,470
manager dropped or a few again so that's

00:50:48,450 --> 00:51:01,999
a bit ugly we put IP on it and again now

00:50:55,470 --> 00:51:01,999
we have and now we just need resources

00:51:07,069 --> 00:51:21,430
yeah says no no servants it's wrong

00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,430
and in tsukuba names

00:51:43,990 --> 00:52:07,190
yes trust okay something's working can

00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:09,230
forward he sent it over wireless okay

00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,660
it's okay can you tell you network

00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:21,590
miniature that it should not occur the

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:31,040
network every minute not sure I got an

00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:33,320
idea why are true no wisely not to we

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:39,700
just keep it up in spite of network

00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,700
management and we took turns back row

00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:57,080
I have a special ripple for the corner

00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:06,920
because we had different color versions

00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:10,550
for the resume tonight maybe I know of

00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:14,510
there was a linux we're at recon fallen

00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:19,430
10oz videos no retreat okay refreshed

00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:23,530
and then we can do super install what we

00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:39,430
wanting we wanna be yeah I we want and

00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:44,990
maybe yes to okay nope infant pertussis

00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:47,990
okay so looks good okay and then you can

00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:59,090
use ssh and we can reuse Syria don't if

00:53:47,990 --> 00:54:03,220
we need to write or maybe try SSH twice

00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,220
as H to the 38 addressing

00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:16,490
30 ages so one is your own address not

00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:16,490
dot 38

00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:32,919
I'm ready ah good but I don't have any

00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:42,160
here's the table okay everyone Nathan

00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:51,279
that's good that should be enough yeah

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:51,279
okay oh that's long yeah

00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,910
I don't just

00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:24,190
this is debian leading so I'm sorry yeah

00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:26,580
I couldn't make it to the Linux programs

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:31,320
work everywhere we just need a root and

00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:31,320
then we can configure the ethernet or

00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:42,400
you can you why oh maybe it's you want

00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:45,790
to end see me to do I should L sure na

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,080
minus s yes when you type in your own

00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:49,960
possible because there is no root

00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:57,490
password yeah okay and soon you can use

00:55:49,960 --> 00:56:08,880
I have conflict on and configure one

00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:08,880
216 and 90 91 / 24 and then we can King

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:18,730
so there get on the conference yesterday

00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:21,550
and I I couldn't make it to install

00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:25,240
alpinus machine ok so if you can pin

00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:33,480
your raspberry okay can I and we have

00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:33,480
ssh yeah sure but let's start a screen

00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:52,320
screen not and starts no would you like

00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:52,320
to ask me

00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:02,600
I have complete

00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,040
ok

00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:35,490
yeah you can get one cable to play this

00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:46,680
GPA hoes like this but make sure which

00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:48,930
one to use all new you want to install

00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,840
extra packages but for the basics you

00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:57,810
don't need to you just do as your troop

00:57:51,840 --> 00:58:07,320
walks through something and now sage 192

00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:16,140
168 and have a huge 699 such it may be

00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:22,020
rude and take some time because it

00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:25,980
cannot resolve yeah piccolo sunny and 99

00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:29,680
dot 38 is raspberries yeah 34 dress Oh

00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:32,950
some reason

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,840
you have placed in a la CBC's lesson if

00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:39,670
you come with their leases static and

00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:49,060
rich no it's in the increased lucky us

00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:51,430
address again maybe realist yeah illus

00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,350
address again you have network miniature

00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:56,350
running and network manager things that

00:58:53,350 --> 00:59:05,200
you should not have an address here so

00:58:56,350 --> 00:59:13,080
we put it on again and now you get a

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:13,080
connection yeah

00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:27,730
wires 12 yeah so we keeps interface up

00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:38,020
and network manager twice to take sit

00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:41,260
down sorry individual is this one not

00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,690
roots may be configured to know such as

00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,850
dating a Davina in debian probably more

00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:49,780
generally in general each other tones

00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:52,210
other two so now we have a connection to

00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:57,070
the Raspberry Pi and how we do with all

00:59:52,210 --> 01:00:01,320
the basic packages you know I PS yes you

00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:07,050
need the internet connection versus yes

01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:07,050
yeah right right it doesn't help bi

01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:30,619
Google names this is the DNS widow

01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:36,640
building a server and then we need

01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:43,049
internet for warning to hear exchange

01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:48,099
yeah that's good and then we need first

01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:54,779
rooting in the lab tabor everything that

01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:57,779
comes from 299 endless us should be

01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:57,779
masqueraded

01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:20,290
our network forwarding process mad happy

01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:24,640
you pay for what and now we have a

01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:30,900
talent okay and with super we can

01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:37,860
install our libraries like aptitude yes

01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:37,860
I think you can have aptitude which was

01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:53,920
yeah actually this is just a wrapper

01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:56,380
script from me and I made it to court

01:01:53,920 --> 01:02:02,470
supervised the right office so if you

01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:04,960
know aptitude install them it we call

01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:09,070
super person right to parades of the

01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:11,770
night oh so aptitude script cultures I /

01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:17,040
yeah excellent and that's your screen

01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:20,470
yeah it's very short very short recently

01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:25,000
and for example if you say we install it

01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:28,610
with method to the and super options so

01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:35,180
you forward every gift

01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:37,130
yeah yeah and it's very good for a

01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,170
compatibility between distributions

01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:42,410
because people know how to use attitude

01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:45,620
and not how to use super so i made this

01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:48,050
reference that's better for people I'd

01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:52,070
like to learn my sushi because in my

01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:54,950
work we all I am always my work members

01:02:52,070 --> 01:03:09,280
are using debian but i'd like to learn

01:02:54,950 --> 01:03:12,170
sushi yeah to be honest also good ok

01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,710
some arguments the pictures the other a

01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:20,110
USB cable that you have brought yeah

01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:23,750
holy that's for serial console the end

01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:25,910
yeah you can reconfigure your network

01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:28,570
for example oh if you mess up your

01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:34,730
network you can't access it anymore ah

01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:37,850
yeah thank you yeah just like stable

01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:40,820
mounting the SD card and yeah edited

01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:43,910
manually you use go you can use this for

01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,980
your life system just syrah console-like

01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:48,680
was your big computer break and use an

01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:51,890
old modem cable to connect two computers

01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:55,310
with cheese other end you can get

01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:57,410
Colonel Locke's if it crashes like if

01:03:55,310 --> 01:04:01,490
you do Colonel programming and it does

01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:05,119
it crash it prints out red crashed on

01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:07,880
the civic on the way and you can

01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,840
copy/paste even from the output then

01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:15,560
because it arrives on the other computer

01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:17,300
and other computers they're working so

01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:25,609
it's very good for debugging such as he

01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:29,790
runs on and if you check sakura and else

01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:38,580
we don't six corner which I package

01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:42,660
yeah yeah I'm pretty good Souza

01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:45,330
and the all the fact and all the

01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:48,710
packages and the majority of the

01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:51,600
packages for the desktop run

01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:55,940
successfully yeah raspberry you can even

01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:01,010
have X 11 was xfce running on it and

01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:04,740
these open suse image for raspberry and

01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:07,950
comes with e with a window manager like

01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:11,840
raspberry SL XD no it's minimal image

01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:16,380
just the shell but you can install it

01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:18,930
say super install X FTE and Senator put

01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:23,780
in most of it but it takes a long time

01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:28,080
oh yeah because I stick are too slippery

01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:37,350
yeah but you can it has very very long

01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:39,900
list of packages like 5000 can it can

01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,800
take quite large space you know there's

01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,800
the car yeah

01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:02,280
yeah you can but it's not as easy yet

01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:05,540
not because I have not prepared it fully

01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,540
was this Oh

01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:24,940
screaming amano command-line things

01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:27,490
night scared she's a so funny path

01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:31,119
especially the enemy for Tony's window

01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:33,250
managers flexible stash her brother

01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:37,660
fotosis me to mendo less to go to

01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:44,440
Sephora in arcata delicacy hospital

01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:48,329
Excel janome Pataki dinner after Vinny

01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:51,640
name I say to our colleague that's this

01:06:48,329 --> 01:06:53,920
this computer is not for desktop user

01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:57,220
tease or you can you can do if you want

01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:04,300
to because you have graphics and you can

01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:11,099
put it on your oh no he loaded XBMC guys

01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:11,099
this is XBMC and

01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:17,589
yeah so that's the nice thing was open

01:07:15,249 --> 01:07:19,599
source because you can just wreak

01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:22,329
impaired for the other platform activity

01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,279
Oh may I ask us on scales and i have

01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:29,199
seen in there raspberry foundation that

01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:32,859
there we have a wiring by libraries for

01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:36,849
accessing gpio and derek that the wired

01:07:32,859 --> 01:07:40,930
by library is installed here buy it for

01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:45,519
I have not done it so it's not part of

01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:47,709
the normal I mean that what's the

01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:55,420
library do you hear in order to access a

01:07:47,709 --> 01:08:02,769
GPIO force um no library you open is a

01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:07,029
violent you import from i wrote blog

01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:11,390
post about it spurring bus will come

01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:14,240
back they have this package

01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:18,279
and that just has a bootloader stuff

01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:24,339
that's a film a package nothing and so

01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:24,339
now everyone the GPIO they are

01:08:28,089 --> 01:08:37,429
unnecessary care whole CD in here and

01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:43,790
then you say i want to use gpio number

01:08:37,429 --> 01:08:48,850
18 and then he refugee pero 18 and then

01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:52,400
you say you want to use it as an output

01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:55,040
you redirect you can set the direction

01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,409
the default is input because it's safe

01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:05,060
and then you say okay no it's an output

01:08:57,409 --> 01:09:08,299
and then you can say the Vegas 118

01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:12,409
Reagan and snow boots on there's power

01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:16,639
on Phil nonsense on mostly yeah on gto

01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:18,710
18 and then you can turn it off again so

01:09:16,639 --> 01:09:21,259
you write a basic bash script yeah

01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:24,109
that's what I use for my traffic light a

01:09:21,259 --> 01:09:28,000
doctor oh can you see that do you yeah

01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:28,000
to get a clear running yes

01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,739
it was the

01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:50,140
beauty

01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:57,840
yeah it was cooked that read and then I

01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:03,660
get a variable was a character that was

01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:10,760
tight and then domination oh just our

01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:10,760
for red and y for yellow and G for green

01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:20,699
let's just wipe on very simple design

01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:24,480
and here in the middle I have cut it so

01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:27,480
that this site has different signals on

01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:31,020
the side do you see this cut here in

01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:35,460
between because it's a a tooth in a

01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:37,949
double pin connector and one side of the

01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:41,780
pins goes here and disconnected here and

01:10:37,949 --> 01:10:41,780
other side of the fence is connected to

01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:55,810
it's a flat flat cable occurred on a

01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:59,260
cable which you can get in all

01:10:55,810 --> 01:11:03,630
electronics markets it's including these

01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:06,040
connectors I made it myself I was

01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:09,989
plugging these connectors and educating

01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:12,310
ugly yeah so can make the size you want

01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:16,330
of course you don't want to make it too

01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:18,420
long because there's a current yes

01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:22,830
there's current going over here and

01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,830
there's some resistance in the cable

01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:34,110
what they use is this one if I have

01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,110
signal one who get hit I make wish

01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:45,060
ground and signal shave and you can

01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:47,520
never save it yeah but they're still

01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:49,890
resistance huh so when you have a long

01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,780
table there will be some money some

01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:56,640
polos type I'm in Cambridge MacLeish

01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:59,600
yeah that's okay this link hello yeah

01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:02,700
you need that's okay and this is the

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,100
this with you yeah I bought it from

01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,750
China but only one of two worked think

01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,610
this one is a broken one so if you want

01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:14,400
to have it too maybe you're pensive

01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:20,100
 is founded on ebay for one euro

01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:34,190
90 including shipping and so Syria

01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:34,190
Antonin yeah so if you have some cereal

01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,650
doing it's the keyboard oh do you need

01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,650
okay

01:12:54,110 --> 01:13:15,050
ah ok so here i type r and enter and

01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:18,680
then my script c-czar its letter ah so

01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:35,480
we do put this one out this one out so I

01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:37,670
0s0 81 and then y3a coach yeah yeah like

01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:44,840
this because I don't want other to

01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:47,870
remain on yeah one off sweet sorry it

01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,150
should be a traffic light so you don't

01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:53,990
want to get your green and ready at the

01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:59,000
same time hearing Greece you may see

01:13:53,990 --> 01:14:06,590
that oh I've seen that some with no

01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:10,970
light on which is a like this yes and of

01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:13,400
course I can do this this all on just

01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:19,580
another pass on my script when I say a

01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:23,170
like all anthem and yellow again MA yes

01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:28,450
yes it's so simple best foot kitchen

01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:28,450
maybe even for Nick there and see it

01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,770
system

01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:47,460
you don't have hdmi or DVI I don't give

01:14:42,150 --> 01:15:07,280
a nation in my screen but TV is easier

01:14:47,460 --> 01:15:14,780
normally so as not very good light and

01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:14,780
maybe it crushed and

01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,579
secret Christian

01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:35,169
it's quite a situation if we say power

01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:39,159
off from the shell is it really powering

01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:41,800
off we have 20 he's between it's

01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:47,889
shutting down and some LEDs go home so

01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:54,610
I'm not sure yeah you could use some

01:15:47,889 --> 01:15:57,280
power measurement to know it so

01:15:54,610 --> 01:16:00,810
yeah not sure if it even Ken doesn't

01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:04,110
have a bias that tells it how to do it

01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:07,990
normally on PCs the bios does it how off

01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:17,040
so linux just says a bios please power

01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:17,040
off and boy

01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:37,410
ah not

01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:54,979
ah some ah no it's working okay so

01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:54,979
something this

01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:26,620
so this very simple one sits on one

01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:29,470
screen so it says here this is set up

01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:32,830
with export of the GPO and output your

01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:35,380
engines and then I have his a loop two

01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:42,370
main loop where does a read one line

01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:46,840
here why read and then it does yeah

01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:51,460
basically case i lose my news okay said

01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:58,660
if it's our than 200 one if it's green

01:17:51,460 --> 01:18:01,120
than 2100 nexus so very simple and you

01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:05,350
could you could write it in tyson or

01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:08,970
Veche but if you can write it a mesh

01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:08,970
it's so simple mountain sing

01:18:17,429 --> 01:18:25,619
so I would not do it radio transmission

01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:28,619
that the key of the radio transceiver

01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:28,619
receive

01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:46,750
ok conscious no radio ah ok then we

01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,750
don't

01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:59,539
you found the debate from China hey 8

01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:12,380
to college and they can I wanted to

01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:12,380
connect with the gpio and switch on

01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:25,739
my father wants it don't be make it yes

01:19:21,889 --> 01:19:28,409
right yeah just may make such a board

01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:31,879
because a cheapy rose or may be

01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:31,879
connected directly with something

01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:40,049
connected directly on the GPIO and you

01:19:35,489 --> 01:19:44,029
make adjustments enters the village of

01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:44,029
the military salute device

01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,390
Oh

01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,620
gpio

01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:35,130
information see it changing

01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:44,870
but if you did it online you can have it

01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:48,560
as a switch like if the cameras there

01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:52,540
and you get to the one and the nuts I

01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,540
could put an alarm system for example

01:20:56,710 --> 01:21:00,550
yeah that's the switch now

01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,070
seems to be

01:25:16,750 --> 01:26:01,360
I mean what do you want what good lordy

01:25:55,770 --> 01:26:03,160
special it because normally you don't

01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:07,470
have an injected food loader on

01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:07,470
raspberry but I guess they made one

01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:20,290
service the default ok

01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:38,540
No

01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:59,760
jgp entity so Katie deport if the prime

01:26:56,739 --> 01:27:02,350
movers O'Connor which is currently

01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:06,430
processing we're talking about the

01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:11,020
analog and digital signal systems gpio

01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:14,500
it mostly it's digital most of the time

01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:16,840
does a digital signal this is to be

01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:21,100
airport yeah but if you are partially 17

01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:24,010
and 18 are a sweet right if I think if I

01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:36,940
if I said it has zero run I switch on

01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:38,719
your suits of the yeah first I know only

01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:43,199
a few million

01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:47,599
it's just for signal yeah but you can

01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:51,840
you can switch relays yeah yeah yeahs

01:27:47,599 --> 01:28:00,019
controller and switch on/off yes that's

01:27:51,840 --> 01:28:02,969
exactly the romantic control using this

01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:06,469
send the signals with a block so instead

01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:17,969
of a button in ATX

01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:20,250
okay so you can connect this cable to

01:28:17,969 --> 01:28:22,409
the motherboard you can shoot so no

01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:31,889
issues of the air come with the box yeah

01:28:22,409 --> 01:28:35,070
possibly yeah just a short circuit so

01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:37,020
maybe you need a delay because this you

01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:39,389
could only can send our or not simple

01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:42,840
but some main words want you to connect

01:28:39,389 --> 01:28:45,210
two pins and you can have a relay there

01:28:42,840 --> 01:29:05,309
to connect or not connect and switch to

01:28:45,210 --> 01:29:07,889
tlie Lavis escape and in principle you

01:29:05,309 --> 01:29:12,090
could do a data transmission like one

01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:16,139
side sense 10 10 and other side receives

01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:20,909
and you can even get a feedback like yes

01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:23,579
I received your one yes I received 20 no

01:29:20,909 --> 01:29:28,579
but but it could be pretty fast in the

01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:34,289
end even but if you receive one one one

01:29:28,579 --> 01:29:37,230
hey you can have a clock like a chess

01:29:34,289 --> 01:29:39,690
you have a pin that has to go what up or

01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:42,000
the other side has to tell you something

01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:43,920
before you continue because otherwise

01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:48,510
you don't know if other side has seen

01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:51,389
you what you sent but yeah you send the

01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:53,309
one the other side chocolates 20 you

01:29:51,389 --> 01:29:56,670
sent another one's other side targets

01:29:53,309 --> 01:29:59,389
one but then maybe you need something

01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:59,389
else for timing

01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:10,410
yeah yeah but you can do protocols is

01:30:06,230 --> 01:30:13,350
there one wire temperature sensors and I

01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:16,050
know one guy last food it's 80 here for

01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:18,000
the Congress he and made some

01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:22,080
temperatures in this for his raspberry

01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:25,429
pi for the sousa server room to measure

01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,429
whole cottages

01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:55,510
it's it's a computer just never look at

01:30:51,280 --> 01:31:03,570
five or six pcs or whatever then this

01:30:55,510 --> 01:31:03,570
doesn't look good is that this function

01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:09,990
you can just ship another one for custom

01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:13,340
install the guards in the Justice black

01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:33,540
moving target no moving parts Loki see

01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:36,090
ya no friends that can die yeah yeah

01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:39,330
it's the nice thing is also that the

01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:43,020
most part of diamonds is the hard disk

01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:45,450
of a computer and the civ hands and

01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:52,800
maybe the power supply because there are

01:31:45,450 --> 01:32:09,480
some electrodes no it's learnt from

01:31:52,800 --> 01:32:12,750
someone would laser cuts would I think

01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:17,370
it's good or very tight at least what I

01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:25,050
think there's just a raspberry in it and

01:32:17,370 --> 01:32:28,980
you see how it's good I guess someone

01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:32,690
has a sweetie printer with a laser and

01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:32,690
the internet has everything

01:32:42,290 --> 01:33:07,260
because there are a million raspberries

01:32:44,580 --> 01:33:09,650
in the world that's a very nice nice

01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,650
material

01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:23,349
okay yeah so I think we are pretty much

01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:26,070
done with the workshop for today so

01:33:23,349 --> 01:33:26,070
