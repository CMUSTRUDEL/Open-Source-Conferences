Title: Bernhard Wiedemann - getting started with Raspberry Pi - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Raspberry Pi is a small and inexpensive ARMv6 based embedded device, which you can also use like a big Linux computer.
It has interfaces to attach various existing or yet-to-be-built hardware getting it on-par with Arduino.
This workshop session can be a place where people bring their Raspberry Pi and help each other to get started with it, including
- getting an openSUSE Linux image onto the SD-card,
- installing extra software in the booted system
- programming something simple with GPIOs (Bernhard brings some hardware to attach to the GPIOs)
