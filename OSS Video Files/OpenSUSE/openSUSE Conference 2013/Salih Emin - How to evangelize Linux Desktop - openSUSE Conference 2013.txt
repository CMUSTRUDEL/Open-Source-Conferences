Description: 
	Linux is all over the mobile market, workstations, server, cloud and supercomputing. But not yet on non-geek, average users desktop.

Linux communities, are trying for many years to convince their friends and relatives that Linux Desktop is already here and its working. Tech-savvy bloggers have been writing about the benefits of switching to Linux Desktop for many years.

But it seems that we are not there yet, even if most PC users are using their PC's to browse the internet, chat with their friends and do some everyday productivity work.
It is time to change our strategy, to evolve from geeks and nerds, to evangelists of Linux Desktop Operating System not just as a community but also as individual Linux users.
