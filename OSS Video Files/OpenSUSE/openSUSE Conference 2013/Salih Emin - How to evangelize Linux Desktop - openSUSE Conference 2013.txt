Title: Salih Emin - How to evangelize Linux Desktop - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Linux is all over the mobile market, workstations, server, cloud and supercomputing. But not yet on non-geek, average users desktop.

Linux communities, are trying for many years to convince their friends and relatives that Linux Desktop is already here and its working. Tech-savvy bloggers have been writing about the benefits of switching to Linux Desktop for many years.

But it seems that we are not there yet, even if most PC users are using their PC's to browse the internet, chat with their friends and do some everyday productivity work.
It is time to change our strategy, to evolve from geeks and nerds, to evangelists of Linux Desktop Operating System not just as a community but also as individual Linux users.

plies linux desktop about Sally hemming

00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:10,980
so thank you very much for being here

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:14,150
and welcome to Greece I will be talking

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,300
about how to evangelize linux desktop

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,119
it's more about the strategy of bringing

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,269
more users to our beloved linux desktop

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,720
environment as we know linux is almost

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:33,350
everywhere but not yet in the desktop

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:37,140
area big corporations have managed to

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:42,149
get the most of the market share on

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,809
servers supercomputers mobiles but we as

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,539
community have been striving four years

00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:57,559
to get a little more market share in the

00:00:48,539 --> 00:01:00,840
desktop area so I want you to feel like

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,820
you can be as an evangelist of Linux

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,090
desktop if you are a community member of

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,680
your distribution but you have to have a

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,869
new attitude towards evangelizing or

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,920
promoting the links that stopped because

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:20,189
this is not an art of verbal

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,240
self-defense it's not about going to the

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:27,060
forums or various blogs when they

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,520
somebody bashes linux desktop and we are

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,299
going there to defend news desktop

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,479
environment it's not about that this is

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,479
an approach we deal with

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,299
take-no-prisoners approach to marketing

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,950
the linux desktop environment we have to

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,750
have some strategy to bring the common

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,710
users the other a joke to the linux

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,689
desktop environment so what is the next

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,770
evangelist where X you can put anything

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:01,320
if we go to the Wikipedia we will see

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,049
that an evangelist promotes the use of a

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,630
particular product or technology through

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,789
talks articles blogging user

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,300
demonstration recorded demonstration

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:16,710
like how to YouTube's youtube videos we

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,560
views opinions etc or the creation of

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,830
projects like simple GUI applications

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,590
that you want to help the users overcome

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:33,130
some difficulties so if you are a

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:36,880
blogger and technologies an opinion is

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:40,030
you may with this definition you may

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,900
also be an evangelist unfortunately

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,260
that's not the truth because the job of

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,470
an evangelist is often closely related

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,070
to both sales and training but requires

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:59,730
specific technology marketing skills you

00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:02,890
may be an developer but you may have no

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,220
marketing skills let's define Linux

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,920
desktop what is the Linux desktop is it

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,680
the ones that we use on our servers is

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,780
it the ones that we use on our

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,420
workstations no linux recipes all the

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,890
Linux desktop distribution that have a

00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,709
well-defined target group of users which

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,760
is commonly known as the average user of

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:32,770
the other operating systems so who is

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,400
this person let's combine this word

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:40,510
evangelist of Linux desktop we will see

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,230
this approach backward who is not an

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,760
evangelist of Linux tehsil a developer

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,239
usually developers know how to write a

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,360
code but don't know how to promote the

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,020
project if you are a contributor to a

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,209
project let's say you translate some

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,550
documentation but you don't have

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:04,270
technical background about the operating

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,700
system then you are not an evangelist if

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,390
you have the terminal guy if somebody

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,300
goes to the forum and ask a question and

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:15,700
you go there and ask him run this LSP I

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:20,080
to see you are not an evangelist you

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:24,130
have lost him so an advocate of a

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,110
desktop linux desktop knows his target

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,560
group

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,300
specifically who is his target group

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,270
consumer psychology knowledge of

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:39,220
marketing knows the product and knows

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:42,880
the competitive product let's get

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,700
started with the target group the target

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,080
group to find your target google

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,960
inaccessible evangelist you must know

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,070
the answer of what you are trying to fix

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:57,190
if somebody is approaching to you and

00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:00,400
has a problem with his operating system

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,410
with the other operating system how do

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
you answer the question what you are

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,250
trying to fix if you are trying to

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,850
evangelize him about the freedom of

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,500
software etc it's not the solution for

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,920
this it's not the answer for this

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,700
question you have to be specific to try

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:21,880
and fix something also you have to

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,730
answer the question why do you have a

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,350
personal computer usually if he answers

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,230
as just browsing just looking for some

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,680
videos listening music and not something

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:40,140
specific like video editor or anything

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,000
else then this guy is your target group

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,590
let's talk about consumer psychology

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,100
this has two factors the social aspects

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,650
and individual psychology so the social

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,880
aspects is usually considered with why

00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:01,570
he uses that OS this is simply because

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,570
he's born with it he doesn't know

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:08,860
anything other than that pc is only

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:13,090
windows individual psychology he or she

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:16,690
how she defines the PC how she defines

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:22,919
the personal computer why here he or she

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:26,440
uses the computer knowledge of marketing

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,560
well when we hear the marketing world we

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:34,030
usually have in our mind just one word

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,930
lies this is the dark side unfortunately

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,650
according to Bill Hicks if anyone here

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,960
is in my

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,960
hitting or advertising you should kill

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,840
yourself because you're Saturn's little

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,000
helpers well this is the dark side

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,039
unfortunately there are people who are

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,949
trying to sell something that you don't

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,699
need and with the cooperation making

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,860
tons of money from this we will talk

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,979
about the bright side of marketing which

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:06,310
is markets are conversations we're

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:09,070
usually trying to market our linux

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,710
operating system through forms so

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,100
evangelizing how beautiful it is how it

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,919
works how community works how we share

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:22,690
our knowledge this is what an evangelist

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:27,090
of Linux desktop is all about but you

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:30,280
have to consider some crucial things as

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,949
everything you do as an advocate of X

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,910
Linux test of adoption by the potential

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:40,660
users if you think that wrong answer or

00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,050
a bashing and newcomer makes you feel

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:48,449
better then you should know that he will

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:51,310
not come back and also he will he will

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:55,060
say that the Linux the Soviet doesn't

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:58,090
work generally that's why youth you

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,159
should think twice before you talk it's

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:02,380
not about your distribution it's not

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,650
about your project it's the overall

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,570
Linux desktop adoption so as an

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,990
evangelist you should hold you should

00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,900
see always the big picture so the

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,030
knowledge of marketing is also about

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,300
when dealing with a user to use the

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:22,060
tools that are available in the

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,729
marketing area which is like simple SWOT

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,669
analysis you have to know your strengths

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:32,250
well we usually do know our strengths as

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:36,130
a linux operating system but we usually

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,650
hide our weaknesses we have weaknesses

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,339
and we have to acknowledge that we have

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,920
to see our opportunities why we should

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,560
promote the Linux user the Linux desktop

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,260
to the specific user what are we trying

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,980
to accomplish and the threats

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,960
what are the obstacles of this users

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,130
using his operating system and not

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:05,030
adopting Linux you should know as an

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:08,270
evangelist both products what by what i

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,880
mean by my experience you should be

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,210
dogfooding you should have at least two

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,150
to three years minimum use of both

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:21,320
operating system or three operating

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:24,350
system using Mac Linux or Windows you

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,260
should have technical knowledge about

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,620
both products and you should know how to

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,870
troubleshooting them both if you are

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,310
using Linux operating system for more

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,630
than 20 years and you have no idea about

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,030
the technology background of other

00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,360
operating system then you have doing

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,730
something wrong you should and be able

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,340
to apply SWAT on both sides on both

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,440
products what are the strengths and

00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:58,610
weaknesses of the other product let's

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:03,860
talk about some quotes art of war which

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:07,100
is usually a book pretty popular on the

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,590
marketing area less than zero the

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,870
supreme art of war is to subdue the

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,330
enemy without fighting which means that

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,670
the most effective marketing doesn't

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,400
even feel like marketing or evangelizing

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,920
to the consumer if you approach it user

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,110
and the user feels that you are trying

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,820
to push him use your operating system

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:31,070
you have lost him lesson one victorious

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,830
warriors win first and then go to war

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:37,360
while defeated warriors go to war face

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:40,160
and then seek to win you should have

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,040
before approaching the user you should

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,710
have a backward plan your marketing

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,950
define what success looks like and how

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,750
you're going to get the up front you

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,320
should know what you are trying to

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:57,590
accomplish why should that user use

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,230
linux desktop operating system listen to

00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,060
put them in a spot where they have no

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,579
place to go and they will die before

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,709
fleeing that means that

00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,619
convincing a user to use the Linux

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,980
desktop and you will gain him just for

00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:15,199
day or maybe weeks but that's not the

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,769
matter here the matter is to be truly

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:21,350
useful or remarkable to a user and gain

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:24,410
him for life doesn't matter if in one

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:27,499
week he goes back to this operating

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:33,170
system but you will gain him for life if

00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:36,019
you are truly helpful lesson 3 the

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,179
general who advances without convey ting

00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:41,029
fame and retreat without fearing

00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,249
disgrace whose only thought is to

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,259
protect his country is the jewel of the

00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:47,749
kingdom this is why you should think

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,689
always as an evangelist the big picture

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:54,170
don't be afraid to fail and don't chase

00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:57,529
influence we will always fail when

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:59,839
promoting Linux desktop but evangelizing

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,360
that is truly help helpful to users is

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,879
appreciated by them and positively

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,259
impacts the Linux days of adoption in

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:14,019
perpetuity how to guide a newcomer

00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:18,040
there's something that most people are

00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:21,589
confused you should keep it simple

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,199
simplicity is what matter here you

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:27,559
should use direct mail contact or chat

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,929
or full be available on the phone if it

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:33,379
is your friend your colleague you should

00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:35,569
be available for him use your fail use

00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:38,839
their favorite communication methods

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:43,790
don't push him to use something that he

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:47,230
doesn't know don't push him to use chat

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,639
rooms that are not known for him use his

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,009
communication methods as an evangelist

00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,929
if you know the other products if you

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:57,889
know the proprietary protocols you

00:12:53,929 --> 00:13:01,999
should use them don't say him just

00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:03,980
google it don't say him rtfm or search

00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:07,220
that form for the solution here's the

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:11,209
link or go to the IRC do that for him

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:13,910
for the first time do that don't use any

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:16,879
philosophical aspect of liberal software

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,080
yet it doesn't matter he doesn't know

00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:22,850
about it

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,410
he's from another background in time he

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,960
will understand he will ask questions

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,630
then you can evangelize him about the

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:33,200
beauty of liberal software stick with

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:37,820
the plan try to stick with the solution

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,790
of the problem the whole secret is

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:45,020
peer-to-peer communication don't put

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:47,570
anything between you and him speak to

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:53,060
him directly as I said before with mail

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:55,520
with chat or with phone so which linux

00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:04,670
distribution should you evangelize any

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:13,670
ideas no why am I here hmm it's a tricky

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:16,940
question huh yes yes that's the truth

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,300
remember doc pudding use what you really

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,480
know it doesn't matter it may be an arch

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,450
linux doesn't matter for the user

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,460
because you will install it you will pre

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,230
configure it it doesn't matter because

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,850
you will give him support about that

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,560
also you should know three alternatives

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,050
ones also how to use it how to

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,640
troubleshoot it why because there is no

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:48,020
one-size-fits-all every user has his

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:50,510
needs so some simple rules go with the

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,600
default settings when you choose your

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:56,000
distribution respect the brand respect

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,340
what the distribution community has done

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,970
for that overall experience of the user

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,640
don't go and change your icons put your

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,130
favorite wallpaper or change the theme

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,970
keep it simple keep it the default

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:16,130
settings cut down the choices for the

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,830
end user choices is something that he

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,260
doesn't know that we know that we love

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,660
choices we love customized baby will up

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,120
everything about freedom he doesn't know

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,830
don't bash him with three desktop

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,230
environments and dead-looking you can

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,610
choose what no show him what he should

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,310
use for the first time show

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,459
him what you use daily in daily matter

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,209
and you should also consider that not

00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:43,459
every liberal software is for everyone

00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:48,130
that's the symbol both for non-liberal

00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:50,779
software because we think always that

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,899
specific software can solve his problem

00:15:50,779 --> 00:16:01,579
can fix this problem that doesn't really

00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:05,120
the case always some readings art of war

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,769
but I couldn't put a book here because

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,589
there are tons of books this is from

00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:11,899
gangneung Emperor's time it's on bamboo

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,730
don't try to find it ok there are tons

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:18,140
of books printed electronically each

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:21,529
other also also shop a knife how to be

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:25,360
always right you need this it's a good

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:27,380
and fine book also linux on desktop

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,490
lessons from mainstream business

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:34,399
adoption this is a quick white paper

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:37,100
it's not long it's a good one it's a

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:41,480
survey that I've been done with the help

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,269
of IBM and it talks about what how

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,470
mainstream big corporations have done it

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:54,160
so we can apply it on linux on desktop

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,160
so and questions

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:08,539
any questions good are there any other

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:08,539
