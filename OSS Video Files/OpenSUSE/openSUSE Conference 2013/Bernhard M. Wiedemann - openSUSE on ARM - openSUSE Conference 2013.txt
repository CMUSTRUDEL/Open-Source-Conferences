Description: 
	How to build with OBS

Normally it is a hard task to port a whole distribution to a new CPU platform, since not all packages allow for cross-compilation.
This is why openSUSE went a different way by building pseudo-native with qemu.
This presentation will be about how OBS, qemu and some other tools and tricks were used to efficiently build packages for ARM (aarch64, armv7l, armv5el).
