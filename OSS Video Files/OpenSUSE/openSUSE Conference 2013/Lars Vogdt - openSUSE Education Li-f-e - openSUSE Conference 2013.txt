the moment oh one of these is Yiddish

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,140
you can see him here he only heats the

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,390
driver behind all opensuse education

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,530
progress that you can see in the public

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,020
so even he is created 12 23 the life

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,890
education version and he has some nice

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,890
students working for him and I don't

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,939
know how you manage it at least they

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:57,140
produce always the well-recognized logos

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:01,740
and boots pleasures and so on for him so

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:04,369
I don't know what he puts on them to get

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,750
all this kind of stuff but it works

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:11,870
andrea is now a teacher in Italy when he

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,709
started with Opelousas education

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:20,340
it was I guess still a student so now

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:25,950
getting one stepfather and James you can

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:28,349
see him here is in the u.s. doing all

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,319
the crazy stuff promoting us in the US

00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:35,120
and Iran's an own school district in

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,040
boston with around five thousand schools

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,889
guess what's running they're not on all

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,109
desktops meanwhile but most of the

00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,639
servers are currently running opensuse

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,040
education and especially all those

00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:54,439
applications so he can manage its with

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:57,510
them and yes yo D and David coming from

00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:02,180
let's say other distributions especially

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:04,889
David is normally with Ed Boon to

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,069
interesting part was once he asked me he

00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:12,000
came into a discussion and tossed him I

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:15,930
guess he asked me huh what are you doing

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,239
it's so hard in the ed boon through to

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,000
get something new I just want to

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,419
implement some Moodle stuff to get some

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,060
courses online or linux linux for

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,389
education so on a certain let me guess

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,030
next day I get to him back at foster and

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:35,790
said okay here's your URL here's your

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,229
Moodle installation please start and

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,109
that's what he say okay that's nice

00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:42,989
wonderful I begged the other guys two

00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:47,790
years to get this now I have it in one

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:50,699
day I said okay you get it very fast now

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,359
you have to deliver very fast and so we

00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,790
filled up the Linux for education org

00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,590
domain with all the contents so we have

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,629
currently around 50 online courses there

00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:07,889
where people can start learn how linux

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:10,849
works in education which is from my

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:14,519
point of view a really nice success and

00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:19,349
then we have others and others most of

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:22,710
them teachers some students and many

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:25,100
many more working on parts of that what

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,070
you can see as opensuse education

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,650
so we have someone who makes the designs

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:34,580
some packagers and many many teachers

00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:37,940
trying it out at schools and reporting

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,240
back sadly most of the time they report

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:45,880
back back success stories but ok we can

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,880
live with it ok if you want to join us

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,970
here's the URL open to the education

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,070
team that's where you can fax and that

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,840
is also the place where you normally can

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:02,020
find how to reach us ok just to give you

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:08,450
a short history i put something on the

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:10,990
web to have it easier so let's see how

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,990
it works

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,740
but up okay

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:28,229
now I cannot see anything here on my

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:32,909
laptop er there okay 2002 is not the

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:37,080
right here of course not we have we

00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:42,210
missed one point okay 2001 could you

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:48,150
imagine that zuza has a thing for school

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:52,169
since 2001 started with 6.4 suse linux

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,889
6.4 when some teachers in germany

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,960
started to develop a school server just

00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,680
to help schools bring all the clients

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:07,289
into the internet that was a starting

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,629
point and in 2002 zuzu just jumped on to

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,180
this really new brand new market and

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,520
says okay there are already some school

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,669
servers around based on linux now we

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,249
will do it as profession and do they had

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:25,649
a cooperation woodford the Uni input and

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:28,199
those said good you develop a school

00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,349
server for us that was the point when

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,620
the suse linux school server was

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:40,020
developed it reached the market 2002 in

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,419
2004 Suzy decided okay it's more or less

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,240
outdated arrived already we need to

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:48,389
refresh it but get no money from it so

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,819
we do the outsourcing and the suse linux

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:58,789
wizard was outsourced to the excess gmbh

00:06:52,819 --> 00:07:03,349
it's still alive so okay a bit kidding

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:06,300
so you have a school server since 2001

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:09,389
means for 12 years already up and

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,059
running based on those linux and it's

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,059
still alive currently based on / 11 sp3

00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:22,460
so what comes next

00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,460
oh yes

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:32,800
desktop for education 2006 start a

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:36,380
desktop education some guys in Austria

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,190
decided okay the whole austrian country

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:42,380
should only use linux for now they are

00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,050
still working on it but they already

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,530
have some progress last time i met them

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,440
they told me that 25,000 clients are

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:56,750
already running linux there and good to

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,520
know opensuse linux so in 2005 the

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,039
developers of the school servers have a

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,430
meeting with guys from Deb yarn with

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,820
guys from school early notes hey Dora

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,400
there was also one guy and Ubuntu was

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,180
not there because I didn't exist there

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
and they decided to have some agreement

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,590
about how it's ruled server should look

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,479
like so some requests for comments

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,599
coming out for the file system

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,690
structures so people and end users can

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,180
exchange the school service is if they

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,640
decide not to like them or whatever and

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,789
in 2006 also there was a first release

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,400
of a distribution called link Hut based

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:46,310
on something around I guess suse linux

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,470
10 dot one they just enhanced this is a

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,510
linux distribution with some additional

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:58,220
education applications and meanwhile we

00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:01,310
get them into the boat so link had 20 or

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,470
30 is no based again on opensuse linux

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,510
using the applications which are in the

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,510
opensuse education repository

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:21,670
okay I cannot read it again from here

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:24,250
okay 2008 opensuse org should be there

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,740
already that was also the case when

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,800
opensuse education project was founded

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:36,730
officially and as one of the first steps

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,800
we get an own range on ftp zoo come so

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,890
there we've got an on project we get on

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,930
wiki pages and that was when the current

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,470
opensuse education project really

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,600
started so before it was just some

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,100
underground projects people make money

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,920
out of it but was not officially 2008

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,440
google Summer of Code we got a student

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,410
which is now called Gandiva working here

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:08,310
for us said Souza developed the easy

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:12,310
ltsp client helping teachers to run

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,060
pixie clients without having the need to

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:18,550
go to the console so with easy ltsp I

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,220
can show you some pictures later and

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,850
maybe even if this laptop works I can

00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,920
show you in life you just say okay I

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,190
have following keyboards the following

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,090
resolutions on my monitors please go for

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:36,160
it then easy ltsp will create a

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,860
configuration file for you configure all

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,440
the services that are needed dhcp tftp

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,440
and so on and then you can simply power

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,420
on all your other machines and they will

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,650
just start up coming up with the latest

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:58,420
opensuse education distribution and also

00:10:50,650 --> 00:11:00,880
we got a new new logo in 2008 yeah and

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,450
then it stands when people start

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,490
noticing that there is something around

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,100
opensuse which is called education and

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:15,130
we got a lot of press and a lot of

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:18,010
boosts on different pairs like deductr

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,890
like post them like Enoch stark and so

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,889
on where we showed up and presented our

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,829
Linux distribution and as a result

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,449
we also get good press releases from

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:32,649
different vendors from different

00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:35,470
magazines and that was really the most

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:38,529
funniest part because you had those hard

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,589
work in front first and then you can

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,730
earn at least some press statements

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:48,489
there and that was really funny so in

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:52,989
the end I guess more or less it is the

00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:57,699
end yep yearly we are now at opensuse

00:11:52,989 --> 00:12:06,399
for education life based on opensuse 12

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:10,019
for three questions so far wow good so

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,019
let's see what I have next

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Oh

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,780
okay the gold sponsors education so

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,740
maybe no project without goats so we

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:38,780
also have won support schools using

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:42,530
linux and please read it carefully we do

00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,630
not right opensuse here because if we

00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,150
don't care in the end if it's just

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,910
opensuse or if it's a boon to or if it's

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,920
the door or whatever you like at least

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,670
someone should know the operating system

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,220
behind yes the school is running Linux

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:02,720
they can contact us we try to fix or

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,240
help them as much as possible so as I

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,220
mentioned already it's just linux so we

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,650
try to build across distribution

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,380
community and we already have contact

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,390
with the Fedora guys some of them with

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,190
little bundle and also with the

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:21,080
scholarly nooks team which is based on

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:22,460
debian at the moment work together we

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,610
have some developers I guess it is

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:31,450
normal support home users and their kids

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:35,030
that's interesting for us we are not far

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:38,180
with this step because we started I

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:41,030
guess two years ago writing in just

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:45,440
would you all for this so people can

00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:49,160
simply define some website some services

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,070
that their kids can use so it's limited

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,370
then the kids jump into the machine so I

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,760
want to serve somewhere they just have a

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,970
limited amount of URLs that they can use

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,190
even limit the amount of applications

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,740
they can run so they can just for

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:09,440
example run some games or some learning

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,980
stuff and no games or the other way

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,170
around so I get me get it but we are not

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,170
far from this because a good summer of

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,080
code Siddhant just decided not to finish

00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,810
it so the state is currently open so

00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,090
here's someone who wants to me great

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:30,550
everything to the new you just with Ray

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,550
and rails fine just

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,540
yes provide the best applications for

00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,570
servers and desktops especially for

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,170
those application guys I guess that's

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,800
not surprising and contribute to and

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:49,620
improve opensuse yes we couldn't be

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,490
trying to push more and more of our

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,480
packages which normally start up in the

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,660
education repository in the build

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,570
service to the real opensuse

00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,210
distribution so I guess for 12 for 3 we

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,779
make a big step forward got at least 20

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,930
packages inside but yes there's a lot of

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,160
more to do the problem is educational

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,110
packages are not so easy often because

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,650
mostly students write them when they

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,110
begin to study computer science and

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,000
packing King them is not always easy

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,180
because you have to catch a lot you have

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,640
to try to align them with rules that the

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,260
distribution has and so for us it's

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,420
often a hard work to get a new

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,700
application up and running even if the

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,709
user says oh it's so easy normally I

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,680
just configure meg Meg install and it is

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,420
there but if you want to push it into a

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,240
distribution you have to follow other

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,900
rules and other guidelines and opensuse

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,620
is very strict what they accept into the

00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:58,020
real distribution so we you need

00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:01,620
packages yes finally answer a question

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:04,560
that we always ask ourselves where we do

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,310
the people teach tomorrow so we want

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,830
them to switch from this crazy little

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:17,420
distribution with the windows in it to

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:20,990
something that is more useful okay

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:25,190
the question is now how many of those

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,740
goals are to build already yes we have

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:32,360
currently over 400 packages in the

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:35,660
education repository not all of them are

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,070
education packages I'm sorry the problem

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,850
is that most of those applications

00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,610
applications need special libraries

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,550
third party packages and so on so you

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,980
can say we have around 150 real

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,310
educational applications in this

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:55,520
education repository we have an own

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,800
domain opensuse minus education org

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,980
which is completely independent from

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,260
opensuse enthuses oh we can even provide

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:07,700
some stuff that user does not like to

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:10,640
provide you have this domain i mentioned

00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:14,900
already linux medication org where we

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,180
post all that training stuff and we have

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,870
a live ESO and then testing part is as

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:23,780
the life easel is hosted on opensuse

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,640
minus education org we have no problem

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,720
to include such crippled stuff like

00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:32,510
ffmpeg or the video Lana clients so if

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,060
you use our either image you directly

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:39,650
can start watching movies playing your

00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,330
normal impact place and so on it's one

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,310
of the benefits when you're independent

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,310
on such a big company as protein

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:56,010
yes and we get assistant from other

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:58,860
companies already so open to the media

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,679
for schools in Germany we did this in

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,179
the past and hopefully make it again

00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,490
desktop predication server for education

00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,919
I mentioned it already they jumping over

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,260
to into our boat now the cooperation

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,900
with the exes gmbh which is running the

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:17,700
school server providing us the ability

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:20,190
to provide users who install the school

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,020
server within out Leah's profiles so

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,049
they can simply push up their clients

00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,490
once and have been installed and

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,150
integrate it into their school

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:35,510
environment just by saying yes I want it

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,510
and we've linked hat which is currently

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,030
yeah they're using opensuse but they are

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,290
currently evaluating what's going on

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:47,730
next because they have no more money so

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,280
only they focus more or less on

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,750
themselves we lost a bit we contacted

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:58,290
them yes a person we have a great

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,840
community people asking around creating

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:08,570
web pages helping with documentation and

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,570
so on it's very nice Oh what we want

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:17,190
yes show people how easy it is and I

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,520
guess with this live DVD and they use

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,070
beastx that we can provide now it's

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,950
really easy so people can just jump into

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,490
the school's put the DVD or a USB stick

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,620
in their pcs start up and don't have to

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,860
care about the artist because we don't

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,410
touch them so everyone who knows knoppix

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,660
and this canopic is especially for

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:45,030
educational uses we have it yes better

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,920
promotion is one of the big tasks for

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:52,710
the next month's so we started right now

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,020
giving a talk here and we will contact

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,300
all those magazines again to get some

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,140
press release and so on to get some

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,860
announcements out and of course everyone

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,870
is already invited here we join us step

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,480
in ask questions we have a non mailing

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:15,990
list we have an herb channel open to the

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:19,350
minus 80 on freenode and yes more or

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,840
less that's it from the presentation but

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:24,210
if you like and if I still have some

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,100
time I will like to show you what we

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,100
have as a desktop solution with life

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,760
try automatically helps

00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,550
whatever you wants to me

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,610
okay so this is what you normally get

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,590
when you put one of those either images

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,960
it just takes too long to shout hear

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,649
that it boots so I decided install it

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,490
and then forget the DVD as you can see

00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:22,299
it's a standard of loser distribution so

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:25,029
nothing to hide nothing special beside

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:30,460
all those special packages that we add

00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:33,309
to the DVD so my one of my favorites

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,679
because my little daughter lights it so

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:48,460
is G accompli who knows it already

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:50,860
that's one okay turn on the sound this

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,220
little application is maintained by

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,990
Bruno codeine a French guy a nice guy

00:21:54,220 --> 00:22:00,570
really nice guy I have a pleasure to

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:03,940
meet him in Bergen during the pasta and

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:08,139
he's writing this application I don't

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:11,500
even know since when I would say two

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:14,529
thousand six or so so you can really

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,190
easy start for example train your people

00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:22,929
to use the light and left mouse buttons

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:29,039
or in this and this this kind of area

00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:29,039
just the testa to the keyboard so

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:40,380
okay I guess you see this is one game

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:43,960
and there are a lot a lot of others so

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:54,010
Oh doesn't fit into the money to argue

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:56,530
until the Beamer ok so now i have to

00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,690
type the words here before they reach

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:05,170
the ground otherwise i will get the blue

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:09,970
again so start learning how to type

00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:13,840
correctly on your keyboard so next

00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:17,530
category just discover the Braille

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,540
system so if you have son it's easy I

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,540
don't have it at the moment so sorry

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,810
memory always great just one thing I

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:36,210
like to mention for your information

00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:41,890
those stars here shove you how difficult

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:49,260
the game is so first-class second-class

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:49,260
third-class fourth-class in school so

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:59,730
primary schools normally and you can see

00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:06,730
playing memory a game that I always lose

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:09,220
ok give it up ah also some physics some

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,850
experiments so if you ever want to know

00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:20,500
how to operate such a what's called

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:27,310
noisy in English what a look ok so you

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:31,120
know you have to see how it works ok now

00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,810
i can drive in I train this over and

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,500
over again to make it right hopefully

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,500
close the door again

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:47,559
open so the water can come in or not

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:51,519
right it's the wrong one oh close

00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,169
it again open this one and if I'm right

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:58,659
I should be able to open the door again

00:24:53,169 --> 00:25:01,720
yes okay so just some physical

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:13,870
experiments that you can do here or

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:16,840
learn learn how to sew my task is now to

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:21,389
have a shower because I'm tux I'm coming

00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,740
in from the outside here go home

00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:29,470
hopefully this fits on the Beamer no

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:34,570
bye-bye so it took this now at home know

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:40,259
what I have to do try to get some some

00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:40,259
water here so let's see how I get it oh

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,330
no it's wrong wrong

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:57,160
oh okay you have to click on it to find

00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:01,510
out what you need so get some clouds

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:06,700
rain put it into the water and so on you

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:09,130
can also play around with electronics so

00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:19,830
maybe you need a battery here put it

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:27,220
together and oh what's this didn't know

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:28,840
so now connect it hopefully oops and now

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:35,520
you see hopefully that the slide is

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:42,870
already on Oh never make a mistake and

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:45,870
should go out up again okay works yeah

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,870
okay

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:58,070
yeah don't remember me how long I

00:26:48,890 --> 00:27:00,770
studied for this and yes but now Joe

00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:04,040
compy integrates other software at this

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:09,230
moment it's tux paint where people can

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:16,100
just easily say I'm painting now having

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:28,220
some birds here some frogs I hope you

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:32,330
know you here sometimes it also sets the

00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:38,300
name of the bird or so so yeah it's

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:43,280
funny sometimes you want to quit yes I'm

00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:45,140
done no better not this one then it

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,490
takes a moment then it jumps back to the

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:54,350
real comfy by the way your company means

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:58,750
I understand and so here you have three

00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,750
stars makes it a bit more complicated

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:09,320
painting pictures again doing some

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:13,250
mathematics so please type in right

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:20,570
number before talks is going into you

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:26,150
know oh and so on so I'm always losing

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:29,840
here better go back puzzles reading

00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:33,470
activities games so you can also play

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:41,030
chess if you like if your kids it's

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:43,700
already all there and for new ones there

00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:45,830
are also some chat activities if you're

00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,420
in a classroom so they can start

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:53,510
chatting with each other and so on and

00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,260
there are other areas so range workshop

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,260
is one example

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:09,640
so I'll choose the game mode as long as

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,640
it just starts I will open another one

00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:16,400
so a training languages flash Cove

00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:18,590
learning I guess most of us now it ought

00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,049
to learn English or something have a

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,870
card and get the same question what's

00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:27,049
the name in English again and again so

00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,210
you can do it here now online learn the

00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:33,980
alphabet of different languages for

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:41,620
example and hooks type is also something

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:44,289
to learn typing push em up you guys

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:47,210
avocado is sometimes very nice

00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:51,590
especially if you have a 3d on your

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:55,970
laptop because they can simply start

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:59,510
painting some interesting molecules and

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:07,059
get a look at the periodic system of the

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:07,059
elements no not this one

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:16,830
and so on and so on pitching is even a

00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:18,690
Bible study tool if you like and the

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:24,019
interesting part is that this are just

00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:28,850
the applications that ship with the DVD

00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:32,580
so overall I would say they are 50

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:36,179
special for education but we have way

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,999
more the education repository which is

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:43,409
normally edit automatically in the next

00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:46,049
release of this DVD so when you download

00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:48,210
the next version it's automatically

00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:50,759
there for the moment you just have to

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,820
add the education repository manually

00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:58,529
it's also not that problem because just

00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:01,259
helps you here and yes will also help

00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:06,179
you you have a standard of loser version

00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:08,070
installed oh I guess it's linux worth to

00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:13,950
mention because if you run the live DVD

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:18,570
it's also linux as password and you

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:21,299
software repositories will not work at

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,549
the moment but if you go here to

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:32,580
community repositories or maybe it works

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:37,580
oh I have Milla okay ah they you should

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,580
see that there is already somewhere

00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:43,309
where is it

00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:53,560
jeez maybe because I edit it before okay

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,300
so normally there is also open to build

00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,540
service education repository where you

00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:01,360
just need to click on it trust the new

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,740
key and then you're done once you did

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:15,970
that you can go back to your software

00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:18,940
management right I've read on so and

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,440
here you can have you on patterns and

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,560
there you can see you have vacation

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,010
patterns so standard education patterns

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:32,110
also include i chalk this is this little

00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:34,210
icon that you can see down there this is

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,320
important for teachers want to remotely

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:42,250
control the desktops of their students

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:45,580
so each student's desktop will have this

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,760
ayah talk icon running as root so

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:51,280
students can kill it but allowing the

00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,680
teacher to have a look at the desktop

00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,960
and jump into and take over the mouse

00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,850
the keyboard to help them or just to

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,060
show their screen on the Beamer or

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,060
rather crazy stuff with them yes

00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:11,899
hmm

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,030
it just depends on your network in the

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:33,670
end my experience is if you have one

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:37,090
gigabit switch you can run up to 20

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,950
clients on it but you will you will see

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,160
that it's sometimes flickering when you

00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,690
have all those 20 on the overview map

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:50,650
just need to well I tag is already there

00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:52,840
oh no it's not sorry so if you get this

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,580
overview of you just will every five

00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,390
seconds refresh the screens of the

00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,370
students and when you take over its

00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:02,920
instant nurse normally the problem is

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,420
just when you run more than 20 you

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,430
probably get problems inside the network

00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,430
that's true but

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:21,069
yeah then it might be interesting to

00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:23,859
think about separating the Lance so you

00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:28,869
have just one dedicated I talk server or

00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:31,569
master for this amount of machines of

00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:33,869
course the funny part is i have to say

00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:38,139
it it's open source so if you want to

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:39,190
enhancer the jump into the code but this

00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,889
is what i can tell you from my

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,470
experiences and in Germany normally you

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:48,669
don't have more than 20 clients inside a

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:50,139
computer lab and then it just works you

00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:56,019
can also shut down the machines which is

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:59,170
very important ok so here you can see

00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:02,920
for kids or small kids there are already

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:07,239
some selections all those physical cash

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,119
is there ok and for the older ones we

00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,769
have more of course because for the only

00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:16,690
ones you can just also integrate

00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:20,519
something that is not really like f

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:23,710
ereader not really just for education

00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:27,700
but we have it we included so if you

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:30,130
click on this you get it installed there

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:33,400
are also a lot of others which are just

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,219
there as suggestions so normally they

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,789
don't get installed but if you run for

00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:41,259
example a computer-aided design

00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:47,099
application like Python head and just

00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:47,099
find it here ok other questions

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:58,880
no we changed from circus thank you a

00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:01,640
short question actually is it a desktop

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,130
environment specific like bound to KDE

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,990
or gnome or do you have a specific

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:11,660
preference in windowing to kids like you

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:17,150
so we normally prefer either gnome or

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:20,359
KDE we did not much testing on lxde but

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:23,390
what we have as additional window

00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:26,599
application is sugar so if you like you

00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,270
can also start a sugar desktop but be

00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:32,119
warned if you never ever heard about

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,580
sugar before you might be surprised

00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,849
sugar is a completely other desktop

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,940
environment but it's on the live DVD if

00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:43,670
I log out and log in if nobody complains

00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:46,430
I can do it hopefully and you will see

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:50,480
that's completely different one more

00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:52,940
question if I may the KDE stuff do you

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,660
also test it on KDE on that other little

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:01,220
desktop platform with the windows sorry

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:04,130
if you test KDE on KDE no did you do you

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:07,960
actually in the distribution test the

00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,960
Katie yes

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:25,070
ah on windows yeah no we do not test it

00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,810
sorry because we just have all that

00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:33,250
stuff running an open sewer and for us

00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:37,070
it's as far enough to test pull this off

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:39,800
be invited come on and join us we'll

00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:44,900
probably do okay there was a question

00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:48,710
behind you I lost so where are you with

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,660
localization so looking at the whole

00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:55,160
world there are a lot of different types

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:58,520
of languages of letters use think of the

00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,100
Greek alphabet of Chinese where are you

00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,680
with that I have seen the demonstration

00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,950
was mostly in English even the the

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,320
language being spoken so well with

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:12,890
localization and where do you need most

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,140
of that we are as far as open Susan only

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,880
with the localization because most of

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,320
those applications especially for

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,220
example is a cumplir that I showed you

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:26,660
today has already been translated into

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:29,030
20 different languages and even what we

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:31,040
did in the past not yet when we switched

00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:34,010
over to use completely the build service

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,140
we also translated all those RPM

00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,510
descriptions into different languages

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,780
but currently with the build server said

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:44,060
this is not an easy task you just leave

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:46,660
it out for the moment so for rpm

00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,640
descriptions are in English of course

00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:52,450
but for the application it just really

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:57,680
depends on what the application provides

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:59,690
so always help is welcome but not for

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,240
the opensuse education project in this

00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,980
case so if you find some back or you

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,980
want to translate some application

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:10,070
please contact upstream so the real

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,710
developers of this application they are

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:15,110
always mentioned somewhere so you can

00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,360
contact them and provide them the

00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,600
translations that are needed so even

00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,130
other distributions can benefit from it

00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,530
sounds great thanks and one more

00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,300
question the live DVD has all the

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,960
localization

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:32,800
or no we have some space limits so we

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,650
stick with oh we stuck with English at

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,320
the moment but you can easily install

00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,230
other languages as normal with opensuse

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,290
just by choosing just languages at

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:46,270
language and then go for it so even the

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:48,910
applications that we have have some

00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:56,200
so-called language packs which are then

00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:58,350
automatically selected here in the

00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,350
middle

00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:07,579
hi thanks you have a such an

00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:13,880
implementation or are you aware where

00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:15,289
that is sousa education is implemented

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,559
in the way that is launched from the

00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:20,900
ltsp server since when am asking is the

00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,569
most most cool d districts at least

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,789
instant I using that that's here in the

00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:29,809
way you're reminding me that I wanted to

00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:33,109
show something that's why we have this

00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:34,970
easy ltsp because we rely on a ltsp

00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:37,390
project I know that there are currently

00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,950
other projects like X to go and so on

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,589
which we are currently evaluating but we

00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,690
are not far with packaging two years ago

00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:48,079
we were the first ones having eeks to go

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,160
s packages but now we lack the package

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,819
maintainer there but we currently rely

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,099
on ltsp completely so with easy ltsp you

00:40:55,819 --> 00:41:01,180
do nothing more than setting up your own

00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:04,730
ltsp server directly here on the machine

00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:11,450
so in the end when you go through this

00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:20,690
installation step let me sir ltsp did it

00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:24,079
today oh my linux password so let me see

00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:29,589
if i can make it create a configuration

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,589
know i'll edit it there yes it's okay

00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:48,340
rude no fat systems of whatever yeah I

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:55,500
stop no stop so as you can see here we

00:41:48,340 --> 00:42:02,320
have already our pics eboot environment

00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:04,390
now I'm lost here in the directories and

00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:08,860
I did it everywhere last saved maybe I

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:12,130
get it okay I create my own now so

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:18,790
there's a section for computer number

00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:28,270
one standing somewhere and I can say

00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:33,280
okay my ltsp server is this non and I

00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:40,480
can say okay my screen resolution is

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:43,150
whatever likes to type and within

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,230
clients I can just try to find some and

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:49,780
add them here so yeah I better to show

00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:54,910
this later because I have to take care

00:42:49,780 --> 00:43:04,390
of the time at the mo act now if you

00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:08,050
save it okay then did it there no in the

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:13,150
end you can start your server if you

00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:18,130
make it right with a restart button and

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:21,010
then we'll show up too late but there is

00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:24,940
a video on youtube how do you how to do

00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:28,300
it so I'm not the guy who can show you

00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:33,580
this here directly but if you look on

00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:36,250
the English opensuse or quickie portal

00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:39,190
education they can see there is a

00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,320
description to key VLT SP and there is

00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:45,130
the link to the YouTube video showing

00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:48,000
how to set up this to run an ltsp server

00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:51,759
directly it's three or four minutes

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,910
because it's more or less easy if you

00:43:51,759 --> 00:44:04,299
understand how it works okay thank okay

00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:11,950
other questions okay I have a question

00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:16,599
yeah what question but regarding some so

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:19,509
the effects of environments with vivid

00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:22,059
colors and vivid and bright colors on

00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:25,299
the attention and the focus of children

00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:28,869
I just be here some competing interests

00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:31,839
from the one you craft on the other hand

00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:37,299
you have to market this software to

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:39,789
children you have to make it attractive

00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:42,009
to them but on the other point on the

00:44:39,789 --> 00:44:45,730
other hand you have to this software has

00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:53,259
to be to have some positive effects and

00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:56,170
there some positive effect on their

00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:59,470
brain I don't know if I'm interpreting

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:03,190
this research is correctly but how do

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:06,069
you balance this interests you mean the

00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:10,319
marketing interest from zoo zoo with the

00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:15,819
one from the project or marketing this

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,799
software pics from the graphic point of

00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:22,180
view you have with the graphics has to

00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:25,059
be focused on children but on the other

00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:30,970
hand this might have some negative

00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:34,450
effects on on them sorry you mean

00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:36,220
comparing with opensuse no buster we

00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,359
just didn't understand the questions we

00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,359
software yeah

00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:57,680
yes so all right as a lot of very bright

00:45:55,049 --> 00:46:00,209
colors well recent research actually

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,039
indicates that small children have

00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:04,410
difficulty concentrating if an

00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:06,569
application interface it has lots of

00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:10,019
bright colors which is distracting so I

00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:13,229
think the question is how do you balance

00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:16,979
that oh ok microphone back now I'm not

00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:20,400
aware of this sorry I just didn't aware

00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:24,450
of this said some link or so where I can

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,450
read this i don't have the lincoln hunt

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:30,299
but i can look it up ok just give me an

00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,249
email and i'll ping you again and again

00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:38,420
to get some information about this it's

00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:42,119
new for me sorry no more question ok

00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:51,049
we're done and the one last presentation

00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:51,049
