Title: Hans de Raad - Alternative to commercial web-analytics tools - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Talk aimed at the current state of EU cookie/privacy laws and how to utilize open source software to comply with that.
As a lot of things on the web, techniques that were once invented with a pretty clear scope (or seemingly so) usually dont take long to find multiple use cases.
In case of cookies, the nicest form of this is persisting session states between HTTP requests, the nastier form is the mechanism with which a lot of sites knowingly hand over visitor-loggint to third parties (with really nice tools!).

In both US and EU legislation has passed to at least increase the visibility of cookie usage and raise awareness.

Nowadays, a law-abiding webcitizen with a website warns his/her users about this, but this is cumbersome and annoying, because, why would you want to bother your visitors with the fact that you are giving away there information, when cleaner alternatives exist?

Piwik is such a tool, if offers a very usefull opensource alternative to the well-known commercial analytics tools and integrates very well with the leading open-source CMS'es.
This session will focus on some of the legal aspects on cookie usage, but mostly on how to integrate Piwik with your (Drupal) site and get the most out of it.

um let's keep my computer more more MORE

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:20,160
yes justice all right um well since some

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,600
more people are coming in them we'll

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
just about start with a little bit of

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,269
introduction regarding the subject and

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,270
regarding yours truly here let's make

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:38,219
sure I don't get tangled up in stuff

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,960
welcome first of all welcome at their

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,059
conference it's really good to be here

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,190
at least that's my view I hope you

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,910
shared a few and we'll have a couple of

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,110
more days of interesting sessions and

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,329
great friendly talks with the fantastic

00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:00,960
Greek organization by the way I think

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:02,910
these guys really rock but let's put the

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,320
formalities aside let's get into serious

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,810
business this presentation is about

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,250
Drupal and thymic Drupal mostly because

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,409
it's the example CMS I will pretty much

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,049
the presentation spell it for every

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:26,070
website writer PHP based or html-based

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:29,369
it's a tale about cookies and laws damn

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,670
laws statistics because sometimes these

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:40,680
things seem to be invented to simply

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,540
annoy people well Who am I then I owe my

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,070
own business I've been doing that for 15

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:49,979
years now recently with my wife I'm also

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,270
sponsoring this conference by the way I

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,939
think any business who at least gains

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,960
some financial result by utilizing open

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,969
George shoot pay something back maybe

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,329
not by means of money by means of time

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,729
energy evangelizing our new hair just do

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,459
something back because the guys and

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,310
girls making the software really deserve

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,860
it

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,670
I am an open source and open standard

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:23,170
enthusiast basically explains why I'm

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,569
here I have pretty long history also in

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:30,340
advocating open standards in the Dutch

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:34,840
government also the ODF booty standards

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,690
I used to be a bit active in government

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,090
feel them also I'm a big coffee lover so

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,980
if you excuse me once every few seconds

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:48,040
I will take of this tasty beverage

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:50,470
before it runs cold currently I'm hired

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,530
by several companies dutch government

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,209
pharmaceuticals one of my personal

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,519
favorites is the buck or holland which

00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,780
is a classical choir which basically

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,750
shows that you can do just about

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,459
anything as long as you like what you do

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,530
and be passionate about what you do and

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:13,209
as long as you make money with it so

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,980
that's good I am also not a legal expert

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,680
so this talk is going to be about laws

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,980
and regulations but since I do have a

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,079
pulse I'm not a lawyer I mostly am

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,739
interested in the subject and in the

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,239
rules and regulations so the

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,299
presentation which now follows are

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,780
purely my own views at this particular

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,790
matter it's not necessarily the truth

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,609
and absolutely not necessarily the truth

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:44,049
applicable in every country within the

00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:46,090
EU because kooky laws are implemented on

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:49,450
a national basis of course there's the

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,250
European guideline for it but as usual

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,690
with these kinds of guideline everybody

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,639
gets to choose what they want and

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,500
specify what they don't but basically

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,540
this talk is also about evading these

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,299
rules or better use a product called

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,560
Buick by which you actually don't have

00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:12,940
that much trouble with these laws well

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,850
how does Drupal fit into this it's

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,010
simply my CMS or cmf of choice I don't

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,810
know any of any of you use Drupal no

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:25,330
Drupal you you good alright cool cool

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,260
you'll like it too I hope so will you

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,040
come to Prague

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:33,370
in end of sep tember drupalcon Prague

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,750
it's a not the same venue as opensuse

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:45,250
comfort but it's a it should be cool

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:50,110
anyway progress cool I think um yeah

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,030
that's cold not necessarily cool but

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,600
you're from Finland right what are you

00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:00,990
complaining ah alright maybe you should

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,500
have gone a bit more self like here yeah

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,150
but alright what happened it started

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,630
with a cookie no actually it didn't it

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,550
started with personal information and

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,120
the fact that governments decided to

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,180
that they have to do something about

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,890
regulating the amount of personal

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,020
information that can be publicly

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,290
available and also the responsibilities

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,480
of companies handling this personal

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,790
information actually since i am from the

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,270
netherlands just mostly derived from

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:37,230
dutch rules and regulations but where

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,300
specific dutch anomalies occur i will

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:45,240
actually mention that so mostly is

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,240
actually applicable for the greater you

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,510
yeah

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,220
just wait because of the recording here

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,430
like closer okay so yeah so so my

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,250
question here is that as you are talking

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,920
about the laws and especially within the

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,550
EU countries that what i have seen that

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,150
the national laws have been kind of

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:21,300
overall with with EU EU laws and and

00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,150
what I mean it's not the bad thing but I

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:29,460
think it instead of that that's a good

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:31,500
thing and dots have been kind of how to

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,370
say the Icebreaker there that that you

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,530
have had a exceptional good laws that we

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,650
have been following quite quite closely

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:44,130
I hope that everyone has done some good

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,280
things over also there but anyhow as you

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:51,810
are talking that that I do reflecting to

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:55,410
the only to the national laws or the EU

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,180
regulations as well I will absolutely

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:02,430
focus on the European regulations but

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:08,010
since i'm at the chitosan having a Dutch

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,960
company I am affected mostly by Dutch

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,410
rules and regulations but I will most

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,330
definitely indicate when where the EU

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,880
regulations stop and where the national

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,520
implementation follows because this

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:25,770
should be any we talked and it should be

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,740
applicable for most of the you and with

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,630
all EU regulations it's always that

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,450
there is a national implementation of

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,390
these regulations and sometimes this is

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,730
a weaker implementation of the actual

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,010
rule but the interesting part about the

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,870
cookie or at least the privacy law is

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,320
that the Dutch implementation of it is

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,870
so strict in a couple of manners

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,730
especially regarding cookies that this

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,630
has become one of the landmarks of a bit

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,200
politicians trying to describe

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,520
technology while not exactly

00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,449
understanding functional consequences of

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,650
their

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:07,370
actions so but i'll go into the

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,800
presentation i'll absolutely mention

00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:15,539
when i'm off the new track and into the

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,219
dodge track and welcome actually we turn

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:21,419
out to quite a decent audience by now

00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:23,580
that's good all right cookie law or in

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,389
the netherlands taylor communicati bet

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:30,740
its it basically makes a distinction

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:34,729
when it comes to cookies about

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,169
functional cookies and analytics cookies

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,889
functional cookies can be anything you

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,519
need to effectively run your business or

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:48,480
your website like search parameters like

00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:52,800
user preferences that's all all right as

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,870
long as you simply maintain those

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,230
cookies within your own domain / party

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,449
and simply keep the information out of

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:05,760
the directly into identifiable

00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:07,740
information sorts out going to identify

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,180
all the information it later and

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:16,529
actually I'm going to turn on my screen

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:18,269
again which might help actually this is

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,589
actually where I think that politicians

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,440
have made an interesting choice between

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,740
is instead of choosing between personal

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,600
information and functional information

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:30,050
they've chosen between functional

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,110
information and analytics information

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,819
third-party increment Jim I would think

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,079
it would have made more sense if they

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:39,149
simply met the distinction between

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,430
personal identifiable information and

00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:44,790
everything else because that way you

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,410
could in your in your CMS or your

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,319
ecommerce platform make a distinction

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:51,540
between simply handling a shopping cart

00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:55,769
filling it up and only requiring your

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,300
personal information on exit but this is

00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,519
the fact we have to live with right now

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,430
so I'm going to get into that the

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,690
Assumption actually is that by default

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,310
analytics cookies do always contain

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,860
personal information and personal

00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,560
information in this manner is also IP

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,140
adversus

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,350
our identification strings you name it

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,380
that that is actually in bylaw consider

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,400
to be personally personal identifiable

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,990
information to some extent and in the

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,730
dutch implementation of law is actually

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,230
up to the webmaster it sell himself to

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,510
prove that they do not try to track a

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,160
user with that which of course is pretty

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,270
hard since we have a couple of million

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,130
sites but still functional cookies are

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,220
legal as long as user is informed about

00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,110
them and these this informing can be

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,600
done through like a bar on top of the

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,820
screen or some up a balloon saying like

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,110
hey we use cookies if you don't want

00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:02,390
that then sort of use another side but

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:06,490
you have to inform people about it this

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:08,900
is also mandated by law analytics our

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,470
next video distinction here is also that

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,930
with a functional cookie using we have

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,270
to inform the user but with analytics or

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,620
personal identifiable cookie you should

00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:23,089
ask for consent for usage there is a big

00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,500
difference between that because you have

00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:29,210
to actively engage the user in

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,210
communicating with your side and this is

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,400
actually when it became annoying because

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,530
actually most content management systems

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,350
right now if you take drupal magento

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:42,470
wordpress joomla you name it yeah well

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,690
they've got a session cookie and the

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,100
session cookie is attached to a lot of

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,010
information which is stored on the

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,260
server side the session cookie by itself

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,870
does usually not contain that much

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,310
information usually contain a hash code

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,900
identifying the session but not exactly

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,220
personally identifiable information the

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,870
information itself is stored on the

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,000
server and it can only be retrieved by

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:09,020
making a match between the session of

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,390
the user and the server but actually

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,920
this is when the law says all right so

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,720
you're storing personally identifiable

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,490
information and you're using a cookie oh

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:23,240
that must be bad fun part is also that

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,070
and i chose the NPO as a example here

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,720
most of you will

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,530
familiar with up with it that is the

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,370
Dutch public broadcasting agency which

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:35,140
is like the BBC in England they have a

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,290
big problem with this legislation

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,350
because at one end they have informative

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,210
duty towards the general public they

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,610
have to give the general public the news

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,860
information because they are required by

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:53,320
the fact that they're a public

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:55,780
broadcasting agency but also law

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,090
requires them that they should provide

00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,830
information about the usage of this

00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,740
information actually having to

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,060
demonstrate their validity because if

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,570
nobody what's used to public

00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,790
broadcasting agency or on television or

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,140
wherever why should we have one okay

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,540
this is a conflict of interest because

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,370
also they wanted a little bit of

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,960
targeted audience analytics actually the

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,740
government in the Netherlands demands

00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:26,050
from the public broadcasting agency that

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,810
they also give indications as to which

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,550
audience they target which makes it

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,830
pretty hard not to store personal

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,130
information pretty much impossible

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,950
action all right so far for the public

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,560
broadcasting actually just about any web

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:46,000
shop or any site having any kind of

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,740
registration or any kind of yeah well

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,390
intelligence like CMS should have

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,970
actually done the same but because what

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,110
the NPO did they put a cookie wall in

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:59,500
front of it they simply said screw it

00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,720
here is our entry point you must accept

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,610
or else we cannot let you on your side

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,810
which kind of like defies the point of

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,820
public information service but all right

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,460
it's also pretty nasty if you're a eco

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,010
owner whose only goal is like having

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,070
your user by a lot of stuff in one thing

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:21,550
adding one extra click usually helpful

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,760
with that also and this is really

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:27,040
interesting by law the website owner now

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:31,000
is has become responsible for all

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,780
cookies set by the site which also

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
includes third-party so and this brings

00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,800
up the data leakage

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,350
you personal data leakage is high on the

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,990
agenda in European legislation right now

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,620
because if you leak personal data you

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,770
are actually required by law to make

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,740
that public that leakage and actually if

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,810
you offer third-party services through

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,570
your website like LinkedIn for that

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,820
matter and Linkedin gets hacked which in

00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,240
the past couple of years has happened a

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,430
couple of times actually the debts law

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,650
says you are responsible a site owner

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,240
because you chose to put the LinkedIn

00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,060
button and the LinkedIn cookie on your

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,070
website and onto your user okay this

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,210
this creates a really complex situation

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:22,360
so basically I saw more often with this

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,460
kind of very technical legislation not

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:33,360
that many sites actually do implement it

00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:35,610
all right um but the usual reaction to

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,750
legislation is enforce it and

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:42,070
enforcement can be done through

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,260
penalties actually but look at point

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:47,410
three first please because no actual

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,589
financial penalty is in force right now

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,610
these penalties are at this time pretty

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:57,370
much advisories but there is a tendency

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,410
that actually public naming and shaming

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,160
is becoming more and more often when

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,650
people are our website owners experience

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,860
data loss they get publicized on the

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,630
website from the government and actually

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,700
the general thought is that as long as

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,660
you keep shaming them then they should

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:20,310
better their lives actually this is

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,660
pretty valid let's not go into that but

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,450
actually I am wondering about how about

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,050
usability penalties can we charge money

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:32,140
for that to the politicians I don't know

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:34,300
the trouble actually comes when in every

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,940
EU country there is a different

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,940
implementation of this legislation so

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,630
eventually it will probably get back to

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,209
one more common denomination of the

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:50,129
current rules and regulations of the

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:56,139
individual countries

00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:58,059
but wait there's more and I also promise

00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,859
we will have some demoing of be back

00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,699
later on so you will see something

00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:07,539
moving on the screen so stay awake

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:09,370
actually nowadays the view of the Dutch

00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,929
government is not only that we have two

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,850
types of cookies not bleep functional

00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,730
and analytics cookies but we also have

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:20,829
first party and third party cookies

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:22,990
great more diversity the actual idea

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:27,370
behind that is that first party cookies

00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:31,029
are probably only used internally in the

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:34,659
company and the idea of that is that

00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:38,049
actually the goal of these cookies is

00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:40,059
not gaining money by selling the actual

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:43,559
personal information like in third-party

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,730
cookie circumstances usually is the case

00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:49,019
like it's the whole business model of

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,639
mostly in facebook or stuff like that

00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:57,340
but first party cookies are considered

00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:59,649
to be relatively harmless so that's good

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,259
because actually if you remember a

00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:05,259
couple of slides back first party

00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:07,769
cookies functional cookies well you only

00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:10,750
need to inform the user about it so

00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:13,960
actually I think they're Trippier k is

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:17,860
made that first party analytics cookies

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,950
could actually be functional because as

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,470
a business owner my e-commerce platform

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,450
needs a certain functionality or officer

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,279
server functionality in which it stores

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:31,000
the user user data because I actually

00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,379
need that or shipping and stuff hey you

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,200
information that weekend functional

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:38,889
actually there is this change towards

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,090
more pragmatism regarding the laws and I

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:45,240
also see this on a EU level it's going

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,820
towards pretty much a model of

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,879
first-party cookies not that bad third

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,210
party cookies root of all evil something

00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,210
like that

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,200
here we go the bigger picture actually

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,770
is European privacy regulations remain

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,120
standing do actually but in the European

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,210
Union there's a really really really

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,710
interesting discussion going on it's

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:14,679
summarized as the right to be forgotten

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:19,300
or the right to choose to be forgotten

00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:21,730
and basically it boils down to that the

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,040
EU thinks that it would be in the

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,679
interest of its citizens that they would

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,320
have control over their data and not

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:32,650
necessarily the company they once

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,260
supplied some data to actually what the

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,050
discussion is moving towards is a

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,390
mechanism or at least registration which

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,670
makes it mandatory for companies to give

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,130
you an information exit procedure so

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:48,940
that if you want your facebook profile

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,920
to be destroyed then you should have the

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,590
right to really really have that

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,620
destroyed and not have that data on that

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,450
provider anymore that's a philosophical

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,880
discussion because actually it's pretty

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,160
hard implementable in the internet means

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,070
I mean a picture or text ever gets

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,900
publicized then yeah well it's gone it's

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,370
out of your control but still I think

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:15,160
the general idea behind it is more like

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:18,429
being able to demand from a company to

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,150
at least give you to control back over

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,360
your own identity and I think that is

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:28,210
important also in light of the recent

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,860
prism scandal which they are grief did

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,520
an excellent keynote about this morning

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,950
I think actually the fact that you

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,630
publish information on the Internet by

00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,910
means of email by means of facebook

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:45,429
twitter or google+ or whichever service

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:47,860
you use enables governments and third

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:50,470
parties everywhere of creating a really

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,140
really really detailed profile of you

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,210
and that is not necessarily a bad thing

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,190
I actually like for instance amazon

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,890
giving me relevant search research

00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:03,070
results with when i search for books i

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:05,779
think that's pretty handy but there is a

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:09,320
fine line between being handy and be

00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:12,379
steer and this first feeling I can

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,899
really appreciate the second feeling the

00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:18,859
second feeling I'm sorry it gets really

00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:23,149
happy the second feeling is little less

00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:27,320
comfortable because I'm a bit of a well

00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:29,179
you know person who at least lysed likes

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,710
to have the illusion of being in control

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:37,899
of my own actions and this kind of whole

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:41,749
prison thing simply means that nobody is

00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:44,539
anymore you can absolutely post a

00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:46,070
question if this has ever been in the

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:48,259
past I mean in the past there were

00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,179
perfectly efficient organizations like

00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:52,369
the KGB and the FBI will already have

00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,499
fantastic information about everybody

00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:56,509
but the fact that we're doing personal

00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:58,789
information exchange on such a massive

00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:01,070
scale as we're doing today it's making

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:03,080
it really easy for anybody who likes to

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,849
eavesdrop so the fact that the European

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,759
Union to get back on the relevant point

00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:10,039
here is actually thinking about the

00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,739
digital rights of their citizens I'm

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:15,729
quite comfortable with that and actually

00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:18,320
I think the current cookie law

00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:21,919
implementation is just the first step

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:26,299
towards a more well usable pragmatic

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:30,139
approach well you could of course see

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:35,210
well I don't care i use google analytics

00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:40,399
and that's just what i use so why why

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:42,349
bother yeah okay I don't know do you

00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,960
feel like you should comply with traffic

00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:47,330
regulations I mean you feel like walking

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,409
through the red light might be a very

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:55,609
good idea well so go right ahead you

00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:58,219
maybe think that it's at least a decent

00:22:55,609 --> 00:23:00,229
thing to communicate with your users

00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:01,700
about the fact that you're using a third

00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:03,919
party service I think actually basically

00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,219
it should be a decent thing to

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,739
communicate with your website users NM s

00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:12,019
transparent as possible way I think

00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:13,970
every website shoot to some extent have

00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,039
a privacy statement like hey I'm

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,230
visiting this website what is done with

00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,730
my information what is log I

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,440
she on my personal website i also have

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,660
this little cookie thingamajig which

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,190
pops up first time somebody visits it

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:31,470
and it's at least give people a little

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:34,169
bit notional of control but alright

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,260
Google Analytics it has been around in

00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:40,559
internet terms forever everybody uses it

00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:46,049
so everybody will win to use it but for

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:48,090
new customers actually I I asked them do

00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,620
you really want google analytics because

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,380
you know you'll have to ask consent for

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,090
that most users this comes as a shock

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,150
most clients this comes pretty as a

00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,120
sharper why why I'm only a simple web

00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:04,669
shop shelling like baby stuff cute

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:11,549
little cuddly toys yeah still hello but

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:15,770
some actually think that they well just

00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:22,860
let it but they keep using google and so

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:25,830
well find mommy but still think about

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,679
something think about the ownership of

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:32,640
the data yourself actually being a shop

00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:35,220
owner means at least meant in recent

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,740
history knowing your customer knowing

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,270
person Eden knowing your customer to

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,090
that extent that you could inform them

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:45,299
about the choice of shoes the choice of

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,419
tie somebody feels the need to wear it

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:52,290
in 30 degree centigrade anything

00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:55,410
basically so actually and this was in

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,150
previous years or decades also

00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,220
information you would acquire yourself

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:04,169
through your sales channels and simply

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:09,299
digest yourself so right maybe it's

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:11,580
actually good business to remain having

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,760
that information and also there could be

00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:17,040
I actually have still to find one but

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,650
there could be a question you want to

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,919
ask to your analytics database which

00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:27,419
Google Analytics is not able to answer

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:30,980
could be and but alright what will you

00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,650
actually do when these user presses no

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,540
because the fun part

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,010
you mostly will not know this user press

00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,140
now because this information will never

00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:42,670
reach you so you're missing you

00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:47,350
potential actually of information and

00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:49,240
also behind this all is the biggest plus

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,000
side of open source software anywhere

00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,030
what is your exit strategy what in a

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,610
couple of years if there may be Google

00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,710
loses interest in one product which with

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,760
analytics is not that high of a chance

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:05,710
but still it could happen then what what

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,150
do you do where's your data what will

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,250
your export will you export a couple of

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,800
nice graphic PDFs and stuff and then in

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,630
two years time you look at them and

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,370
think like yeah I really wanted to know

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:18,670
actually what that piece of the buck was

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:21,250
yeah well actually is quite a valid

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:27,570
business case for open-source statistics

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:32,290
software anyway so income Spivak it's

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:34,300
actually a continuation of PHP my visits

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't know if anyone of you have ever

00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:43,600
used that stick to not using it please

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:46,480
it's built using a design framework so

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,930
which is basically pretty pretty modern

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,750
in that manner in PHP words it

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:56,140
integrates fantastic with just about

00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,110
anything joomla wordpress and I'm even

00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,770
implementing it at a in a client

00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,310
environment in the SharePoint

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:05,380
environment no they're finding

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,850
SharePoint statistics somewhat lacking I

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,220
don't know if anybody happen has ever

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:13,480
used oh right yeah that's something like

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,140
that um sharepoint 2007 basically does

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,690
raw Excel exports of statistics which

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,630
usually suck so implementing few acres

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,950
are very good idea done actually it is

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:29,200
pretty user-friendly because I don't

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:31,200
know did you actually use the old open

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,910
server side at statistics stuff like

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,590
webalizer oh your stats and stuff yeah

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,750
somebody did all right you're still

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,060
living okay cool but did you actually

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,650
get any any practical question out of

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,600
them and then it usually meant like oh

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,100
I'm my site is visited like

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,480
a thousand times but I haven't got a

00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:55,179
clue why and how and by whom yep that's

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,610
aw said to me um but most importantly it

00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:01,240
stores your data locally it stores it in

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:04,720
a local database it's yours and move

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,120
haha and it's actually used by a couple

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,919
of websites today but alright what does

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:16,660
it do well it just about does everything

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,909
something like aw stats does but with

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,090
the cookies so actually you can pretty

00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:26,740
much identify an individual user which

00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:29,770
is I think good it has clicked path page

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,990
based entry exit pages it even has

00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,299
ecommerce goals targets and stuff you

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:40,049
can just about create anything you can

00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:44,429
nowadays with google analytics you can

00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:48,549
save searches you have group of Commerce

00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:50,260
integration basically anything Google

00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:52,690
Analytics does at least anything

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:57,780
analytic does which a normal user would

00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:02,679
use P which also does but then it looks

00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:06,309
really nice is that all no next fun part

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,730
it can also our server logs and this I

00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:11,919
find really cool because actually this

00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,490
is entirely legal by all server logs are

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,950
static information actually so you can

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,570
use it anyway so even if a user clicks

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,460
no I don't want to cookies anyway all

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,799
right fine jerk I'll parts the server

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:28,600
log I still have some information of

00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:31,270
course I won't misuse it but still it

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,000
has a lot of really nice privacy related

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:38,380
options out of the box like analyzing IP

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:42,220
addresses purging do not track is

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:45,039
actually supported out-of-the-box really

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,320
nice and for site managers and users you

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,460
have scheduled reports mobile apps you

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:55,059
name it actually the scheduled reports

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,980
can be compiled or combined by the user

00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:59,440
themselves so actually this is a pretty

00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,130
much webmasters dream because you can

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,960
actually give the

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:09,610
to your site supporter in them it just

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:13,180
works um are there any alternatives yep

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:16,660
there are you have open web analytics

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:19,540
which pretty much just the same but it's

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:24,150
pretty old from a PHP point of view

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,410
actually and it it's not that much

00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:34,720
focused on the legal compliance issue

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:36,730
well peter is actually striving which

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,040
actually makes it a valid to yeah I'll

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:42,220
try to keep it up should give me a cord

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:46,870
or something um you have crawl track

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:51,040
which is also php-based it claims to do

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:53,980
more than just analyze visitors which

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,270
makes me really suspicious because I am

00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:00,220
a bit curious about the security

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:04,180
one-size-fits-all especially if it's

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:06,280
written in pap stuff i like to use much

00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,240
security to prevent hack attempts we've

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:13,390
not not track info and then you have aw

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,630
stats and webalizer and analog and w3

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:18,280
pearl they're all LLC based and actually

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,640
they look like the control panel of

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:25,710
apollo 11 i think i think mostly they

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,840
suck um especially in configurability

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,270
all right drupal integration there were

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,570
a couple of users in the room so i have

00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,310
10 minutes all right thank you my i need

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:39,190
to invest more in glasses instead of

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,980
bigger laptops there is a module for

00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,540
that what does it do well the only thing

00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,280
you have to do is actually play some

00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,280
javascript in the template of your sight

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,140
and off you go this is actually what the

00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,820
module does actually what the modules

00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,970
you also does is offer you the standard

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,980
out-of-the-box reports inside the drupal

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,930
application which is really nice but you

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,970
still need something like cookie control

00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:05,740
another module to be law compliant i'm

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,110
just going to click through a little bit

00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:12,580
faster than it was intending to first

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:13,049
but actually the default reports are

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,950
what I'm

00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:21,629
going to show you next so it's demo time

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:26,730
and in demo time in this particular

00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:28,259
matter I mean demo peewit org let me

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,409
just check my internet connection is

00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:34,110
still here alright if you log into pea

00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:36,960
wig or let a user login to bwick you get

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,720
this overview you get the dashboard the

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,090
dashboard similar to Google Analytics

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,619
consists of a couple of reports I don't

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:46,109
know just visible for anybody where is

00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,580
it fake yeah all right I'll just go

00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:55,590
through it you have like visits over

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:58,259
time geoip mapping browser mapping you

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,299
have real-time visits the fun part is

00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:03,450
actually people did invest in a welcome

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,409
video of it that's the kind of attention

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:09,619
you want from a project I think actually

00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:12,419
the fun part is that this is

00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:15,419
individually loadable it is

00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,669
user-configurable you can drag and drop

00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:20,369
the whole thing if you want to you can

00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:23,489
also take out a report are you sure of

00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:27,289
course it should have included clip here

00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:31,580
somewhere but if you want to add more

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:35,009
it's amazing what you can actually add

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:39,659
just I don't go I will not go into it

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:41,249
too deeply but go to DeWitt argh click

00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:46,769
around see what is possible it is

00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:48,840
actually amazing it like i said it runs

00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:51,690
on SQL so you can install it next to

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,340
your usual CMS you don't have to invest

00:33:51,690 --> 00:34:01,320
in any kind of extra hosting or stuff it

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:04,679
also does SEO really well actually the

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:08,399
basic reports visitors you have to visit

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,790
the work which basically means who been

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,309
at my side and who did something with

00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:18,139
which device it is done so you can base

00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:20,159
your responsive website strategy on that

00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,240
locations and internet provider

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,330
apparently a well interesting to know

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,420
browser setttings also interesting

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:31,610
I which browser am I currently visited

00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,260
most well as you can probably see this

00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,210
is mostly an open source project with

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,430
mostly open source enthusiasts I think

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:42,320
this shows really from the browser

00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:45,680
families you can also see what the top

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,390
visit times during the day are you can

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,860
see the level of engagement of your

00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:52,510
users I'm going to use a stick around

00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:55,190
see look at one more than one page etc

00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,050
custom variables which are course not

00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,180
set in a demo version but with any

00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,550
custom variable you can simply measure

00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,090
if you do a mailing like you add this

00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,680
variable to the URL to your website and

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,470
you have the possibility of tracking

00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,920
which user came from which mailing to

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,960
your site this also is anonymous you can

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,860
see the actions user undertakes which

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,170
pages are looked at really nice part

00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,200
also is that the pubic module is also

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,730
able to include the page title so not

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,030
only the URL but you get something

00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,200
actually readable because if you have a

00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:37,760
content management system like group or

00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:42,040
you get like URLs like ? q node 1 2 3 4

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,440
5 6 etc but now you get home or

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,530
e-commerce exit pages it's just useful

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,280
to see if a user leaves your side and

00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:55,880
especially at which point here are the

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,770
fights titles actually out links also

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,370
interesting if you do like affiliates

00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,590
with other websites or other platforms

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,650
then you can actually some insight into

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,350
which it actually works or not which

00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:13,160
sites are being visited from your site

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:19,040
which is nice if you have download then

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:22,250
you can also track them of course refers

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,280
also interesting from search engines

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:29,180
which keywords are used to find your

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:33,110
website which keys keywords rank well in

00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:36,920
Google but also which social media

00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:38,720
networks are responsible for traffic

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,950
towards your website which is really

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:52,130
interesting if you do come

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:55,400
change you have a question in between if

00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,620
you would be interested to know better

00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,530
that which parts of the let's say the

00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,930
Netherlands for example our IP addresses

00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:04,730
usually tracked by the by the country

00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,410
but if you are interested that which

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,240
part of the Netherlands the user is

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,420
coming have you ever been able to do

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,430
that actually it depends on the GOI

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,830
people are going to use because you can

00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:19,550
use several gip plugins also what you

00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:22,400
can do out of the book using standard

00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:28,310
GOP service but if you want you can of

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:30,650
course export the IP IP functional you

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,660
get that information so importing and

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:36,770
exporting is really nice I'm actually

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:40,690
going to wrap it up because actually

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:47,290
most of the time has been spent I think

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:51,320
but I'm gonna see just one more thing

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:54,580
because Buick has also a migration

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,840
strategy there are really nice tools

00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,380
migrating from like Google Analytics

00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,390
towards bewick it's really functional it

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,490
works really well you can also import

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,050
log files from your server so actually

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,120
you do not have to start from scratch

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,250
with be back you can actually take over

00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,670
your old implementation and your old

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:15,680
data and run from there which is

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,510
actually really useful if you want to do

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,680
trend analysis over a longer period of

00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:23,420
time here we go questions let's do them

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,550
afterwards because I think my time is up

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:31,690
if I look at the back we have some time

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,690
then I'll do some questions good

00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:45,830
I'll just walk around have some exercise

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:45,830
is good for me does a pay week works

00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:53,720
website or we can start be weak and then

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:59,300
register two or three of our sites and

00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,530
keep track of them just one instance I

00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,990
understand the question I think is can I

00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:08,280
use pubic 1p week instance with one or

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:10,650
more sides question is absolutely p week

00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,710
you can connect an instance to one

00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:16,110
website to keep it a first-party citizen

00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:19,340
in case of the key legislation but also

00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:21,960
you can install pubic on a like sub

00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,540
domain of your website and you have like

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,460
ten twenty thousand websites connecting

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:30,060
through them also it has pretty nice

00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,610
user access control lists features which

00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,480
can separate the XS towards data per

00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:38,610
site so you can also use it as an ISP

00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,950
for your user as a replacement of 8w

00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:44,100
stats for instance does that answer your

00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:51,480
question good anything else you have a

00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:56,340
question cool you mentioned reading

00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,980
several log so I wanted to ask is it

00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:02,880
possible to do it automatically I guess

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:07,200
is and will it somehow the tech

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:11,940
duplicates from server logs via and we

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,400
are the cookies or page visits actually

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,440
you import the server look in a

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,330
different result set than your actual

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,840
cookies so it's separate data anyway

00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,840
anything else

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,599
alright I hope that's because of the

00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:32,090
amount of information I supplied you and

00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,020
not because of the lack of interest I

00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:39,690
assume the first cool all right um then

00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:41,280
well I think nothing more here thanks

00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,790
for staying if you want to know more

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,650
about me then look there if you don't

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:50,640
that's fine as well have a great time

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:52,790
have a great conference and I see you

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,790
run

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:31,540
I hope it was worth waiting for

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,540
alright cool

00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:46,200
oh you were all right yeah people not

00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,200
send it to you

00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:15,430
I think so too and I think they're

00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:17,410
completely user or Google centric well

00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,850
as the plus side of pubic is it simply

00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:23,230
harvest anything from anything but

00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:25,000
actually the fun most fun part about

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,000
Buick is I think the fact that you are

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,830
able to execute custom queries or custom

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,870
visualizations on the data that you

00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:35,490
actually have acquired and I think that

00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:38,170
is absolutely fantastic because that's

00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,340
yeah we've got the road you've got the

00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,860
raw data you take a different

00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:45,150
visualization tool and simply parse it

00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,150
through it's fantastic

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:09,910
alright cool but you aren't pretty savvy

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:11,380
with web tools right yeah all right if

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:17,380
you need any help installing it please

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:19,089
talking about right exactly putting on

00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,740
the hosting environment integrated with

00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:24,180
the template that's it but if you have a

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,180
