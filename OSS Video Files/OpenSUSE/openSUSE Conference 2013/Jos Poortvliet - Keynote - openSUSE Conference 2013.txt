okay hello ladies and gentlemen and

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,990
luxury pelicans only a few have fun this

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,680
is it actually going to talk about you

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,000
say now importance I get birthday and

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,130
released what we do community and what

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,980
do we do it I'm going to talk about

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,250
governance open governance perhaps about

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,920
rules and the rules that we have in our

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,260
community cannot talk about what happens

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,640
when you write those rules down and I'm

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,360
going to talk about how you can change

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,460
them my goal is that you understand a

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,579
little more about ourselves but how we

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,280
work and maybe also how to change

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,870
because Ralph talked about change

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,460
yesterday and I think there has been

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,829
quite a bit of talk about change at the

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,140
conference so I'd like to talk about

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,100
change from kind of the social side of

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,930
things now let's begin with what we do

00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,719
now one hand that's pretty simple right

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,070
we do well in excess solution but on the

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,650
other hand of course there's a lot more

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,630
that is involved of that I mean we have

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,630
OBS we have all these tools and all the

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,020
things around it o Q&A connect oppa

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,240
faith things like that and of course as

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,119
Ralph mentioned you know Souza helps a

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,890
lot of maintenance of some of our tools

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,670
we have the forums we have bugzilla we

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,259
have lots of other things like a wiki

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,350
translation there's a lot of stuff that

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,880
that is related to building a dis run

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:36,659
but I'd like to move on to why we do all

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,820
this so I I always say you know why do

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,369
people do a free software why they do

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,430
now of course for Suzie it's it's you

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,200
can say okay it's business now I think

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,670
Ralph already pointed out yesterday that

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,670
there's a little more to it than just

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,320
business he said if it was up to us we

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,450
would still be selling the books because

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,280
you know we had a lot more well all

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,290
working together on one thing it was a

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,570
bit simpler and perhaps even more fun

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,939
than the more complicated things that is

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,649
needed these days so thinking for

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,290
companies there's more to it than just

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,330
the business side but it is in the end

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,730
what keeps the ball rolling before

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,890
volunteers for the community there's

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,270
more and as I said

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,240
we'll say you know you come for the

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,830
technology you stay for the people as it

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,280
would be destroyed that pulls you in and

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:27,030
says look cool stuff here and it's the

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,760
geek girls that keep you around so think

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,920
about it I mean it's the technology you

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,750
came to the website or somebody shows

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,780
you open Susan you play it with it I

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,780
thought hey this is cool you install it

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,720
you use it for a while and then maybe at

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,110
some point you wanted to try it obs you

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,030
build the packets you merged it and

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,209
that's that's where it started right but

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,980
you stayed because of the crazy stuff

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,840
that we do you stay because of the

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,459
people the get-go the interesting stuff

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,010
and the fame maybe and for some people i

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,780
think gierek talked about that very

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,700
clearly a lot of people also stay

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,130
because they they find out that there's

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,720
more to free software than the software

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,730
Parker's also the free part the freedom

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,180
part and for a lot of us the freedom

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,550
parts is has become more important we

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,530
joined because of technology but after a

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,900
while you discover that this this free

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,519
thing I mean especially now of course

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,620
with prison coming out but even before

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,810
that most of us knew there are some

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,110
stuff going on and that free is

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,180
important for the world so this might

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,190
not be the primary motivation for all of

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,980
you but it certainly plays a role for a

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,850
lot of us so we're making a difference

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,820
in the world and I think that's

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,620
important now what you get out of this

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,070
is of course you get to be super geek

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,690
out right you learn a lot about coding

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,329
or packaging even just working with

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,820
people don't forget the social side of

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,010
this I role in this together we learn a

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,530
lot just working together you learn a

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,690
lot about other people about how you can

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,730
collaborate with other people while you

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,230
do it motivation maybe you have a fight

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,440
here and there that also teaches you a

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,750
lot and this is quite useful you not

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,970
just for you alone at home but also in

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,859
your work and you are building up your

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,540
resume to some extent to quite some

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,880
extent to me some companies get that

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,950
other companies don't but companies who

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,080
do get it they pay for it I have free

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,340
software hackers or more money than

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,550
people well who just do donuts or other

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,870
well less freaks or three things

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,340
it's about thirty percent difference I

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,930
believe even according to a lot of

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,710
studies I mean that's that's fair bit of

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,420
money so it matters yeah not just for

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:43,440
your fun but also for your resume for

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,480
your future and I think about organizing

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,450
a conference like this you know I'm sure

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,790
not only did everyone on this team learn

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,470
quite a bit but I'm betting some of them

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,060
discovered that they actually like doing

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,040
this maybe they want to do more of it

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,840
and others probably discovered they did

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,450
not like it and never want to do it

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,310
again okay that's cool but you learn

00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,140
something that's valuable who knows

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,540
maybe one or two of the blue people here

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,970
will end up as you know organizing

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:14,790
events as a job I mean hey it's actually

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:17,910
a job you can do that if you want so the

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:22,680
question then is how do we do this yeah

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,450
now how of course comes back to all this

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,800
technical stuff that we do right let's

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,050
talk about our tools let's talk about

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,160
the open faith talk about bugzilla let's

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,680
talk about our Q&A to talk about OBS yes

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,660
these things are important but I want to

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,700
talk more about the process and not just

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,790
the process on the side of OBS right our

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,680
branch update merge the package you know

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,690
our burping and all these things I want

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,300
to go a little deeper I want to go about

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,670
talk about what's below this did the

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,160
governance the ruling now from the

00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,810
outsides we've seen quite crazy a lot of

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,640
people think like what the heck are

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,500
these people doing you know whereas

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,120
where's the boss whereas the planning

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,490
where's the process where its product

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,010
management whereas maybe the CEO you

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,750
know who makes choices now the reason

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,330
those people don't understand that it's

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,830
because this is how they see the world

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,720
they think everybody just falls in line

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,360
and goes on one direction and that that

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,340
is the best way of doing it but honestly

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,750
that's rather strange way of looking at

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,140
the world because this is not how the

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:26,160
world works if you ask an organization

00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,770
and the list how does an organization

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,810
work he will tell you well this idea of

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,420
everybody follows leader that works

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,610
maybe in eighteen hundreds and today it

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,580
works in a static organization which is

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,260
in a predictable environment now tell me

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,810
this is 2013 how many

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,390
aesthetic predictable environments are

00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:50,170
there in the world how many markets have

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:52,300
no change none all right we're in the IT

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,880
business I mean that's the opposite of

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,920
anything static and predictable it's

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,510
totally unpredictable so maybe in a

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,330
small company you can have a really

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,100
brilliant CEO and he knows the way yeah

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,600
he he knows all the technology he knows

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,610
all the people he understands the market

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,830
that can make the choices but it's not

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,250
how it works in bigger organizations and

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,600
certainly not in our environment and top

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,190
down as a system that doesn't work

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,680
anymore today it's the Information Age

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,360
things go bottom up and we have twenty

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,200
percent time projects we have heck weeks

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,720
and that's that's where the real future

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,230
ideas come from horizontal communication

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,760
in organizations things like that so it

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,350
doesn't mean there's no planning and

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,060
doesn't mean there is no leadership is

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,110
this different kind of leadership a

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,030
leadership leader in 2013 is somebody

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,730
who knows how to pick the right people

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,350
how to keep the mouth fated and how to

00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,630
create an environment in which they can

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,060
do their thing and thought somebody who

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,270
tells other people what to do now this

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,610
brings us to opensuse because that's

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,340
very much how we work it also brings us

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,680
to open governance now what is

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,480
governance and you can read Wikipedia

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,470
about it you can read lots of sites and

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,050
lots of books about it I would like to

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,500
use my own definition here governance is

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,560
a structure both written down and more

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,940
implicit that guides people in their

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,310
behavior so that also means that open

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,260
government and open governors and closed

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,760
governor's or corporate governance or

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,370
however you want to call it it's it's

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,720
essentially the same thing right the

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,430
mechanisms behind it might be different

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,349
but in the end governance is governance

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,830
the difference is of course where things

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:38,169
come from now that that structure that

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,050
guides people in their behavior it can

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,050
be split in two things explicit and

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,630
implicit and the explicit part we all

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,290
now that's visible that's you know our

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,900
structure as a community it's written

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,950
down hierarchy committees the team's the

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,050
guidelines

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,240
all the south and these rules they are

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,940
set by some kind of process that we know

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,460
it may be democratic or or it was set up

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,960
a story in our case for example other

00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,850
things come from from how Sousa

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,060
initially thought it would be good to

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,650
structure a project and you all know

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,150
what I'm talking about right here we

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,150
have the the guiding principles

00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:19,000
transparency collaboration innovation we

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:23,050
have our code of conduct okay be nice to

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,170
each other we have our strategy our old

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:28,900
strategy by nouns opensuse for

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,970
professionals kind of of course we have

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,580
our tagline have a lot of fun it's also

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,640
written down so that's part of our

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,270
explicit structure but there's more to

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,500
how we work this is our implicit part

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,130
that's kind of the culture of our

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,600
project as a community a culture is the

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,180
definition of it is a shared

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,760
understanding that people have with

00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,470
guides their behavior in other words

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,030
that's clearly part of the governance

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,830
write the structure that guides people's

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,140
behavior so this is a shared

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,570
understanding of the world it's about

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,030
the way you look at the world the way

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,770
you think things are supposed to be and

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,870
you're usually not very much aware of it

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,180
but at the same time you know all these

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:15,340
rules they're really important actually

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:19,350
yeah who codes decides just do it talk

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:21,730
is cheap rtfm I want expand on that and

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,130
credit where credit is due and well

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,530
everybody had stopped posting we know

00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,330
all these rules and when you mention

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,280
them it's like yeah sure of course we do

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,650
that but it's not really written down

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,370
there's not like the guiding principles

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:38,230
as a website that says you know just the

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,610
weight or who codes decides I mean we

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,190
yell these things at each other all the

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,220
time and that's of course how we we

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,250
spread them you could write these things

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,410
down and it's a bit like the Ten

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,910
Commandments right I mean I'm sure that

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,790
you'll realize it before the Ten

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,890
Commandments were written down people

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,140
already had most of these rules it's not

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,060
like everybody thought until this was

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,700
chiseled in stone that it was okay to

00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,860
rape and torture and kill people of

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,840
course not they knew that right this is

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,650
documenting existing practices

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,080
that's what happened the values written

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,630
in stone our normal human values that

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,240
existed long before someone thought

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,630
about writing them down but at the same

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,310
time it was kind of a big deal why was

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,690
it a big deal that that's what I want to

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,640
think about now for a few minutes what

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,260
happens when you write things that

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,260
everybody knows and everybody follows

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,030
what happens when you write them down

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,560
there are four things that happen when

00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:40,960
you write things down the first thing is

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,150
if you write things down it becomes a

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,580
little harder to change them after all

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,440
it's written down so if you want to

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,300
change it you need to discuss it you

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,670
need to talk about it I mean imagine

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,280
there were 100 Commandments I not just

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,110
the 10 main rules but there will be

00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,030
stuff that is honestly completely

00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,890
irrelevant today right the world has

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,010
changed quite a bit in last two three

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,960
four thousand years it would be quite

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,060
problematic if there were rules about

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,370
how you need to close yourself and we

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,830
would all follow those literally that

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,590
would make things hard I mean let's say

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,940
you know you need to wear very few

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,220
clouds that wouldn't really work for

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,890
Eskimos I'm sure and you know the other

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,530
way around that it's the more rules you

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,560
have the less flexible you become as an

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:29,080
organization or community and take

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,330
slavery 3,000 years ago it was

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,340
completely normal nobody had a problem

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,220
with it you won't find anything in

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,830
anything written before 2000 years ago

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,680
that says you know maybe there's

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:45,370
something slightly more Lee shady about

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,460
slavery completely okay at the same time

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,620
today everyone pretty much agrees that

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,200
that something wrong with slavery I mean

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,670
you use it as a bad term and we have

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,440
laws in pretty much every country

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,480
against it so the world has changed

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,310
quite a bit and it's good that those

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:06,430
things are flexible it needs to be so if

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,460
you write down rules you need to also

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,170
write down how to change them and keep

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,860
in mind that even when you do write down

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,070
how to tell you still made it difficult

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,560
other

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,210
second thing that happens when you write

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,670
rules down is that you have to start to

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,230
follow them that sounds rather obvious

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,090
cuz you know you followed them before

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:30,580
too yes but you had some flexibility and

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,950
take the top passing thing you shouldn't

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,040
top past as long as it's not written

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,040
down you can be quite easily flexible

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,320
about it yeah someone writes a huge

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,910
brand to an email list you can reply

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,470
with the top person say look this kind

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,050
of we don't want that here end

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,610
of it if you have a written down rule

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,320
you shouldn't do tapas and you might

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,080
think twice about doing that even though

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,170
it makes total sense to break the rule

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,960
in that point so writing down rules

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,660
makes it harder to break them and this

00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,490
is also very cultural dependent on

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,350
culture I mean some cultures are much

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,090
easier bending the rules a little bit

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,540
other cultures are very black-and-white

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:14,230
it written down to do X dou X nothing

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,880
else so there's this also gets us an

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,100
area where there are big differences

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,710
between countries and people how they

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,220
look at it so the second lesson is you

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:26,200
know bright down rules in a way that

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,910
includes this flexibility because of

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,280
some cultures it's just not very

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,790
acceptable to break rules when you write

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,860
rules down make them flexible not static

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,140
focus among goals instead of on the rule

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,260
itself on the behavior that you want but

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:46,690
focus on why you want this third thing

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,660
if you write things down it becomes

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,400
clear what to do other people from the

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,630
outside they can see okay this is what

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,780
I'm supposed to do because you know it

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:57,940
says here do X and this is a good thing

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,110
about rules they bring some clarity they

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,360
bring you know an easy way of knowing

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,750
the projects it brings transparency to a

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,730
projects and some free saucer projects

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,830
have written down a lot more than others

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,150
for these projects it's easy to join

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,770
them even though you might not like the

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,650
rules at least you know what rules are

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,490
and we're as opensuse I think quite well

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,930
known for being well very opaque we

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,490
don't have a lot of rules written down

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,950
and that makes it harder for people to

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,060
find out how things work and this was

00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:31,000
mentioned yesterday

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,330
how do you become a package three fewer

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,310
in opensuse well one person managed to

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,580
do it but nobody really knows how we did

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,380
it so these things might help to write

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:46,480
it down at least from the perspective of

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:48,550
let's get new people involved so written

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,160
down rules do remove a barrier to

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,470
contribution and other thing that they

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,150
do is they create some kind of trust as

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,090
soon as you've written down this is the

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:01,180
process of becoming a reviewer in

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,220
opensuse then people who do those steps

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,410
can trust that they will become a

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,790
reviewer because if someone that goes

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,710
like you know I don't like this guy

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,050
let's not make him reviewer way we'll

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,060
wait you went through the steps this is

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,300
the process we wrote it down I have to

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,040
follow this so it also creates kind of a

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,930
trust you know that if you put in the

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,510
time and the energy you will actually

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,510
get the desired outcome if all these

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,250
things are vague and not written down

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,860
there's actually no guarantee for people

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,680
who follow the rules that actually will

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,420
get what they were trying to get I think

00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,430
this is something a lot of people don't

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,200
realize but writing down stuff actually

00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,980
creates kind of a trust because it

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,500
creates a promise do people buy why they

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:49,600
do what they do and how they can get

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:51,400
what they want so you can count on

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
people to follow these things and then

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,300
know what will happen it's really

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,070
important I think I mean you wouldn't

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,570
sign the multi-million dollar contract

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,640
without actually writing down what you

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,500
would get for it with you it's not a

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,730
smart move usually i was actually fifth

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,170
one sorry i SAT for last but not least

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,590
this this is a slightly different one

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:17,140
this is almost a vague one I would say

00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,850
but rules have a tendency to grow this

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,890
is the bureaucracy that we all dislike

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:23,860
so much me yes bureaucracy has good

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,200
sides but it has bad size namely that it

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,760
has a tendency to grow keep growing and

00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,010
keep growing you get more and more rules

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,500
and this might even be one of the worst

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,600
sides of rules because it's very hard to

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,690
prevent and once you've written down

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,299
things you might change them with some

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,950
effort but totally removing them

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,600
doesn't have a very often so once you've

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,669
written stuff down it probably won't go

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,440
away so you should think about what you

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:51,440
write down and when and where for what

00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,789
reason good ones you have you might be

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,429
able to change the we won't be able to

00:17:52,789 --> 00:18:00,649
erase it so it grows and that I think

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,139
that's important point of rules oh oh oh

00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:05,659
that's a little too fast to thank you

00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:07,759
okay so in conclusion I putting the

00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:09,470
writing on the wall has big impact on

00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,200
the community as I said at the beginning

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,639
I wanted to understand what it means

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,139
when you write down rules now this is

00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,840
what it does the things to keep in mind

00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:21,109
that they become hard to change and hard

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,139
to ignore but help people to understand

00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:25,730
and become a part of the community

00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:27,289
downside is that it gets worse over time

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,869
you get more and more rules and things

00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:32,480
become complicated can be praying but

00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:33,739
can create a big rigid structure that

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,710
get in the way of actually getting

00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,700
things done because the world changes

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,580
rules can change but they're always

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,379
behind rules usually change in response

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,789
to changes in the world not the other

00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:49,940
way around so that slows change down now

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:52,070
we know the visible rules and this is

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,919
the writing down stuff let's talk a

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,960
little more about our culture here you

00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,789
might wonder okay you know I talked

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,220
about it just do it and the the other

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:05,690
elements of like our culture and how we

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,230
think and work so where does that come

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,909
from I want a project has formed the

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,929
people who join they bring some kind of

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:15,739
baggage right it's it's their

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,419
understanding of the world I said

00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,460
culture is he shared understanding of

00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,899
the world where does it come from well

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,720
everybody has an understanding of the

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:25,549
world obviously I've from around history

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,809
and the things we've done so when you

00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:29,139
come together and you start to work

00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:31,909
together you start to share this and

00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:34,100
that's where it comes from of course in

00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,869
the case of opensuse Sousa had a big

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,809
impact and d'souza engineers that

00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:40,909
started to build up opensuse they had a

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,940
certain idea about how the world works

00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:45,859
it was very much a company culture and

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,950
that got infused in opensuse as a

00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:51,259
community but it changed and one culture

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,639
evolves and grows it is because all

00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,929
these baggage comes together and the

00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,740
people come together and they start to

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,020
work together

00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,910
they do things together and you know

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,130
they try something and it doesn't work

00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,200
so then now they learn okay this doesn't

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,520
work they try something else and there's

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,410
a lot of yelling and they figure out

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,740
okay after some yelling it actually does

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,360
work so culture change you you build

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,910
together your culture you learn together

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,980
at some point you all kind of have the

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,040
same idea of how the world works and hey

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:22,400
you have shared culture community

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,830
culture so this interaction create some

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,730
kind of story about how the world works

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,370
and the do's and don'ts are clear to the

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,830
people are involved because you know

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,420
they got cynical or angry replies when

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,820
they did something wrong and they got

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,710
praised perhaps when it did something

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,570
right of course it's learning process

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,390
it's also part of the culture it's

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,370
different in every community and you

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,830
have to realize that people can have

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,010
different culture in different places we

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,800
humans we are very good at a depth in

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:57,140
two different places like somebody who

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,650
has this just do it attitude in opensuse

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,540
might have a completely opposite

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,880
attitudes at work or at home or in other

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,260
places people can be completely

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,550
different a different place I mean you

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,480
might have noticed this in real life

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:13,460
it's it's not as visible as it should

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,200
perhaps be because people really are

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,950
very flexible in how they deal with

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,030
culture of communities and places now

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:26,150
the question then is where how do we

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,100
learn these rules to new people well of

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,750
course they they take a tour to new

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,309
people right because we have a certain

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,490
community culture and our culture

00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,260
spreads to the other people who join us

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,610
we kind of push him on newbies as part

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,720
of the becoming part of the community

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,910
process now this is very much monkey see

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,500
monkey do okay you you watch other

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,450
people at work you lurk on the mailing

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,610
list and you see how people work here

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,350
okay if you do top Houston you could

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,420
yell that okay apparently there's a rule

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,250
down the top posting might not be

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,070
written down but it's there and you

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,530
learn it and of course there's also a

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,030
selection process now you watch you see

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,910
people yell at each other you think what

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,950
a bunch of boat let's say unfriendly

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,720
people I don't like this I go away

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,639
selection process people who don't like

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,860
the way we work leave they leave

00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:17,820
silently without see that but it does

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,730
happen quite a bit and of course it

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,559
usually did the most noisy community

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,289
members that have the biggest influence

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,450
on the culture it's the the benevolent

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:30,120
dictators as it works in the linux

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,799
kernel community where basically the

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,590
behavior of linna's has a lot of

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,149
influence on how other people behave

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,539
including the yelling that he well lot

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:42,059
of frequently does its same in a company

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,440
right I mean that the CEO the things he

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,059
does are very visible so that they

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,649
fluences a lot of people in the

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,299
community in the company and other

00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:52,350
people start to behave the same whether

00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:53,809
it's good or bad so the community forms

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,820
itself after the most influential

00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:58,620
invisible people kind of the leadership

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,480
and this is of course where change comes

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,279
in because you need to know this this is

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,990
important how do you change the

00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:07,049
direction of the train how do you change

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,389
the community how do you change the way

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,570
we work this if we need to want to

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:14,789
change we need to know how to do that

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:17,730
it's not very easy and a company you

00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:19,559
might be able to write make new rules

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,840
write them down and force them or people

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,450
you know we don't really have that in

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,340
the community so even if you make rules

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,970
in a top-down process you can get a lot

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,139
of opposition especially because people

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,000
aren't even aware that they currently

00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:36,090
have rules so they will feel bad about

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,669
the new rules but not really know why

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,470
because they simply have these implicit

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,870
rules in their head that go against it

00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,600
so they will yell a lot of the new rules

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:48,000
but not even be very concrete as to what

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,380
is wrong so you get a really well

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,990
screwed up communication about it so

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,519
let's talk about this change now of

00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,100
course writing down is part of the

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,380
solution if you can write down how you

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,990
currently work and agree on that I

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,059
figure out what the rules are that helps

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,309
you a lot if you want to change it helps

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,409
to write things down you might not

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,480
really make rules out of it but at least

00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:15,659
make clear to people look we have this

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,690
way of doing things and take the just do

00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,010
it we have this culture of just doing

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,330
you need to be aware of that before you

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,040
can change it this may be

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,310
it's harmful in some way then you need

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,700
to know that and talk about it let's

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:32,100
take a simple example here as a

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,500
community let's say we want to make

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,510
everybody happy now I mean you can't

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,130
ignore user so it uses want something

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,380
you need to give it to them or use a

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:44,990
central distribution after all with the

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:49,470
left what users want at all costs choice

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:52,050
now okay you know the rule now you need

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,040
to figure out what is rule you want and

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:58,680
our example people who are part of the

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,900
community will probably all agree that

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,550
it's good to give people what I want now

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,980
our users need to get what they want

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,560
that's a sensible rule that's how we see

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,060
ourselves we help our users we were

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,890
friendly community that makes tries to

00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:15,630
make everybody happy so that's something

00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,340
not to fix right because I will be

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:20,430
unpleasant for at least some of our

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,980
users so you really need to have very

00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,840
clear idea then to know why that rule is

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,120
wrong before it can change people's

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,310
opinion because it's something that's

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,020
really deep into the ideas of the

00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,330
world's that people have I culture

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,640
shared understanding of the world it's

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,680
not just rule that people see but it's

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,950
really about how they see the world it's

00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,960
rather fundamental thing so you need to

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,830
really think what's wrong with catering

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,080
to users and make a list and it leads to

00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:52,770
compromises we're off nobody is really

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:56,190
happy it leads to chaos you can't have

00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:58,500
proper solutions that way brings good

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,890
for everywhere everyone but nothing

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,140
really great for anyone and try to make

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,670
a more concrete try to really have

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,120
examples and then maybe you can begin

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,280
make change happen and you say you want

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,050
focus you want to make things that are

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,320
perfect doing one thing even if they

00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:18,900
don't do something else okay and then

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,000
you have to start changing things and

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,190
that's where the monkey see monkey do

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,570
comes in again now if you want to change

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,330
the culture you have to change for

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:30,090
people see every day so you need to get

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,060
buy-in from the most visible people the

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,040
leaders the bloggers the people who talk

00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,540
a lot on many less people have a lot of

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,070
spect in the community that it's not

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,810
always a one-on-one relationship of

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,760
course can be people who talk very

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,830
little when they say something everybody

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,290
listens these people are important you

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,610
need to talk to them you need to do not

00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,860
only convince them that there's

00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,620
something wrong you also need to

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,220
convince them that it has to change and

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:59,760
why it matters now remember again it's

00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:02,340
explicit implicit so they won't be very

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,710
much aware of these things so we have to

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,450
point it out and give examples show

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:11,670
really that there's something wrong and

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:13,980
talk about it often it helps a lot to

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,870
show the results of the rules right the

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,190
bats at fault here and there if they're

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,450
not aware of it by the way this is of

00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,160
course something that works a lot better

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,420
face to face that's one of the reasons

00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,860
why we have a conference here we can

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,660
talk about things that are hard to

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,970
change if you do it here over meal right

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,450
culture is really hard to change over

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:39,540
meal so once the people agree with the

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,850
issue and that there might be a way to

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,800
improve it you have to convince them

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,170
that it is possible to change things and

00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,840
more importantly that it's them who can

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:50,160
make it happen and it's important

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,050
because people will only change the

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,540
behavior if not only the outcome is

00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,720
desirable but if they only also think

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,640
that they can actually do it now you can

00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,960
make something really interesting people

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,240
might want it but if they don't think

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,700
they can do it why would they bother

00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,470
putting energy in it so it needs to be

00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,920
clear that it's actually something that

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,630
can be changed and then and in the

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,120
example that I've been given that means

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,580
you need to talk to those people change

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,520
the behavior or help them with that and

00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,130
make clear that you know there is change

00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,950
possible and then the train will start

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:30,000
to change directions and that will take

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,300
a long time I mean changing the rules or

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,620
a process can take weeks or months

00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,920
changing culture is something that

00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,240
usually measure in years so it's it's

00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:43,440
something that can take a very long time

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,600
but change does happen and once there is

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,820
a bit of change once you have good

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,450
examples and bad examples you need to

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,100
make

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,630
noise about them and remember the

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,670
culture is about the story we have

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,100
together and it's about how we see the

00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,500
world it's about what people see so you

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,890
need to change that you need to blog

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,930
about the good things talk about the

00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,060
good and the bad things that's where you

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,610
can seng than the process of change

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:13,620
great stories do interviews maybe

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:16,590
celebrate success now we're pretty much

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,510
already at d and end of the most

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,070
important things i wanted to go over we

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,830
talked about change talked about the

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,730
rules i'd like to reiterate a little bit

00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:29,280
with a couple of more slides and then we

00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:32,220
can perhaps have discussion or questions

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,170
or just well go to the bar and drink

00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,010
something continue to recover from

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:41,400
yesterday now the first thing i explain

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,900
is that there are always rules okay you

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,030
might not have seen them written down

00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,280
but they are there and actually

00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,200
unwritten down rules are probably

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,720
stronger than the rules that are written

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,430
down there's always something guiding

00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,940
people's behavior whether you see it or

00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:59,340
not so saying you know well you know

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:03,150
we're community without rules that's

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,810
basically just doing this and going and

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,510
that is really not real it's not how the

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,280
world works there's always rules just

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,430
the question is are they clear and

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,010
written down can people see them now

00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,430
when you write them down something

00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:22,020
changes you make them harder to change

00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,840
you make it almost mandatory to follow

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,150
the rules on the other hand the rules

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,510
will provide guidance help newcomers to

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,760
get involved and give clarity they give

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,290
a promise day know what they will get

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,970
when they put in energy in the community

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:41,490
other downside though is that they will

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,920
start and continue to grow and grow and

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:48,750
grow so you need to have ways of keeping

00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,400
them in check now culture forms the

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,530
backbone of our community the way we

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,060
work it's its rules that are invisible

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,370
but they're there and they're always

00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,020
there and they're important so where do

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,600
they come from they come from the people

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,580
who bring it from the history of the

00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,980
project

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,020
and it's taught by what people see by

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,660
the new ways they watch us go about

00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,730
doing our things and they learn from it

00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,750
and the most visible people are there

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:17,150
for the most influential how do you

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,400
change them well you change what people

00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,920
see change the leadership and change

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,470
their behavior right make stories

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,790
promote the good things that's how

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:32,000
change happens in communities now I wish

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:34,330
you a lot of hearts that's it there are

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,330
any questions

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:21,039
oh I mostly wanted to continue about

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,370
yesterday where r all set there is

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,840
change needed but there is change in our

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,510
community and we are changing some

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,570
things that I'm honestly also quite

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:34,210
happy with so whether I want to see more

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,470
change I did not really want to go out

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,320
here and say there needs to be more

00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,210
change because honestly I think there's

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,910
processes at work there are going in the

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,470
right direction so the answer to the

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,510
question do we want to see more chains

00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,220
well I want to see it continued the way

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:53,230
it is going right now I think that's

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:55,480
going well I do think that it helps to

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,850
be aware of how change happens and why

00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,030
it happens and that's why I wanted to

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:02,320
talk about change and culture right a

00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,650
lot of people are not aware of these

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,539
things and well as I mentioned you now

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,970
saying there are no rules while there

00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:13,090
are rules they're just not very clear I

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,710
think it's not a helpful thing so it

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:18,309
helps I think in the discussion about

00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,440
how we work and why we do what we do it

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:24,010
helps to be aware of the way we work and

00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,429
the way change happens so hence the

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,429
subject

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:40,150
I just what most important change you

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,850
have seen the last year in the project

00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:46,790
sorry what's the most important of Cigna

00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:53,630
speak most important change you had seen

00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:57,890
this last year the most important change

00:33:53,630 --> 00:34:02,720
or one that I find found really positive

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,250
i think is that two years ago two years

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,780
ago i think yeah for the conference two

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,460
years ago we introduced a code of

00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,560
conduct which resulted in a lot of

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,210
yelling on the mailing list now we have

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,290
it and everybody seems quite content

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:18,350
because haven't seen a lot of yelling

00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:21,560
anymore so I think that seems there are

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,660
still for example some I think

00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,200
communication issues on my mailing lists

00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,910
it's going better at times there still

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,890
room for change I think there's a bit of

00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:35,090
a process going on there i think a lot

00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:37,190
of us agreed that you know there needs

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,140
to be changed and that already is a

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,900
first step i think now if you go through

00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:45,410
the process that was ugly step two step

00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,820
three two may be aware that there needs

00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,530
to be something to change now the

00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,450
question is of course and this is really

00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,640
actually I think Rodham visible and some

00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:56,560
of discussions people think you can't

00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:59,390
change they say well you know if people

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,430
get you know are annoying and

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,100
discussions yeah there's nothing you can

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,260
do and that's not true of course you can

00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,960
do something ever we don't have rules

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,480
against it well yes we do our rule right

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,920
now clearly is that you can yell all you

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,810
want and you can be really loud and

00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,970
that's okay you can even get you wait

00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:19,160
that way so you get what you want by

00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,710
yelling really loud that's apparently

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,170
the rule because that's how it works

00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:26,660
saying that there is no rule it's not

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,050
true there is a rule it's a bad one I

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,370
think something that needs to change

00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,960
that last part people are aware of the

00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,550
first part the fact that there is a rule

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,770
on our mailing list that if you yelled

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,780
really loud that you sometimes even get

00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,470
your way that's something most people

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,470
are not aware of

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:52,630
