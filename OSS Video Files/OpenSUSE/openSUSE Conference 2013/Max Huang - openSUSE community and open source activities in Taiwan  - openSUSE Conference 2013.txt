shopping in school and that is a good

00:05:54,469 --> 00:06:00,770
news we had a regular Nina's coast in

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,159
University that means they must study

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,440
the nearest but it's a long story but

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,340
why we had success this year because

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,710
because I translate the sustainer price

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,380
Nina's booked into the church in a

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,270
Chinese in Taiwanese is very important

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,080
you want to promote something you must

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,659
have books yeah so we have a rigorous

00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,340
course and after they join the nearest

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:27,590
Coast they will should get some

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,229
ministered vacation they will check out

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,870
a song or n0 an oval certificate leaders

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:36,339
a demonstrator yeah because of our Asia

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:40,630
people they must get some purpose yeah

00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:43,600
so we start to consider when we promote

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,780
and yeah before we do that we were like

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,710
maybe we will get a DVD series okay go

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,560
ahead ok to install 22 format to destroy

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,860
your Windows PC but for ancient people

00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,020
is very difficult so we try to another

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,370
point so we integrate with the NH nghe

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,880
there is an open source project called

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:11,380
easier so what is the user means is the

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,870
virtual classroom so in the best man

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:18,070
that is a hypervisor user kvn in the

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:21,040
middle well they use the open era yeah I

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,770
know now obviously use the oven steak

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,370
but it's very similar ok and in front of

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:31,060
then if the students browser lets the

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:37,060
polar html5 ok they can easily very easy

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:39,090
to or create their vm ok so for the

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,970
seasonal numerator we create this

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:45,360
project 22 lat so they can let me use

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,760
the cluster and pure layer private cloud

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,660
just one click install and beer

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,450
assistant for users if their browser

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,820
support and can do the html5 for example

00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,460
Google Chrome for simple fire fast they

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,060
can ssv and they can use the RTP like an

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:09,160
ssh they can use the VNC over all red

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:12,280
spice ok ok oh let's do x some table so

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,680
why we do like with the Chinese card

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,260
system ok so oh yeah I switch you lie to

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,410
English because in the settings we have

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,540
a macro language here and yesterday I

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:29,560
try to use a grease but it's pretty

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:33,039
difficult to me so I sure english ok so

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,620
for us first student we cut a point and

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,140
this this year we have a very big

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,360
success in Taiwan why because Microsoft

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,370
increased layer license-free to the

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,650
screw and sucrose or no we don't need we

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,060
don't need we don't want to pay more so

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:51,040
last year ok the new taipei city

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,490
government laid aside to deploy the

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,690
nenas pc folder 10,000 pieces too

00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,760
each school okay so if you are in

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,160
charter inner school okay how can we use

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,040
how can we let the student use the

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,100
leaners yeah it's quite simple you just

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,660
ask the student to open the browser and

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:18,190
you can accidentally crate and input the

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:21,160
name and choose one over engine system

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,920
do you want let you see it you can

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,800
choose the of course yeah we put the

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,649
opensuse on yet so when the student

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:34,120
create an open sewer VN motion machine

00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:37,839
guess what hvm folder normal small site

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,050
to caribbean just one or two minute you

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,899
can create a VN and you can use it so

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:59,980
that's very convenient to a student so

00:09:43,899 --> 00:10:03,640
again they can sled you can create equal

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:09,579
you can create one 1050 vm at the same

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:12,399
time ok so when i push it a crate ok so

00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:16,240
us USC there's a vm here and they are

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,589
start to put ok so for student they can

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,690
create a VM and they can use the VNC and

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,029
notice the second story because

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,779
yesterday I asked folder podcasting

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,630
because before we use in the Taiwan we

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:35,140
use I Teal'c but I think ever the very

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:39,550
have network pens for podcasting so we

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:42,579
we do a very very much lab so what can

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,980
we do we can ask each router ended and

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,010
the student to looking at the same

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,350
account so they open the browser with

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:52,540
the one window and the in shorter to

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,959
operate a window and you can peel the

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,390
same purpose tulip or casting and the

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,820
any other one is you know the student

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:05,620
behavior later I'll change so they start

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,050
to use the enjoy tablet so the same they

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:13,360
can use the enjoy order bread too

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,730
operating the VMS and for the other for

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,940
the other hand we are started to write

00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,820
enjoy applications for this one so you

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,459
can say that easily you can you can do

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,370
some operation to Susan operation here

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:31,950
to your virtual machines that are not

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:35,200
easy easy and we can go back to

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:38,920
presentation my VN is correlating to

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,010
Taiwan another local design are not in

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:46,260
my computer system so for the purpose

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:49,209
and you can see here our testing

00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,779
opensuse I think that it that is in

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:56,110
progress so yeah that is that and is

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,200
ready right so for another purpose so

00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,779
student in the school when they get in

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,640
crossed that in shuttle yeah just what

00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,399
just simple to say okay open your

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,160
browser okay start your open Susur and

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,990
they don't need to worry about they are

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,670
they are crash that do something bad

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,250
with the operating system because there

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,160
any change they can set them until it

00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,149
and create a new one and student go back

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,190
to home they just do very simple the

00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,070
same over their pc you're going to enjoy

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:32,440
an open a browser and culminating back

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:37,480
to the school okay so yeah that's our

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:40,329
the other one yeah okay so less than

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,279
that's another real case we we cover it

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:47,260
in a very big University in Taiwan and

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,990
they gather once all of the environment

00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,800
for students they each other they have a

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:58,270
level they had 70 note for this service

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,870
guess what we create 100 I'm sorry 1000

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:08,260
VN yeah for create each one the end we

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:10,839
just used 1.8 2nd for 1 VN yeah so let's

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,740
also suppose successful story in Taiwan

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:17,410
ok but this is my yeah that's not

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,930
because I i know i'm i don't have much

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,200
time but i still need more

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,020
more what okay I still I think maybe we

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,290
should corporation more so we my new we

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,060
may we a single eyes it makes sense we

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,399
must say lanch party with different area

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,640
not just in taiwan maybe you can have

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,950
lunch party taiwan beijing okay or

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,630
European at the same time but I think

00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,029
maybe that's a good idea if we have if

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,830
we have opensuse Asia because they are

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:47,670
patient in Taiwan tea in India and Japan

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:50,080
and Singapore users group in Asia and

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,690
maybe I think I weekend co-workers

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,940
ground Asia or KD team an SEO in the

00:13:52,690 --> 00:14:01,800
future but when I come here I another

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:04,089
purpose for an as because in the

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,209
elementary school and the junior high

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,520
school let us start to some computer

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:13,810
science lab and praying in the inner

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,360
compass so I saw that is a very group

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,550
project that you call a resume pie yeah

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,190
I know some guy until they are they are

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,560
aware with the resume pie yeah saying if

00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:26,290
we can get recently pie with Owens rusev

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,470
we can get to the campus very deeply and

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:32,920
maybe Google's I'm a call and I wish for

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:37,930
education we can involve to an airplane

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:41,110
if we can come by it in education this

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,420
plane is called a PhD tea I don't know

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:47,410
you here not here rod is the project

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,270
fall for Colorado University so so this

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,610
project they can have a different

00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:55,150
language so you can use a user one

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:58,950
language and you can stack by oh sorry

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:01,810
you can select by the label and a

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:04,959
different subject here you can see here

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:08,079
ok you can be a fiscal by Reggie us

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,970
earth science and math akin to the

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,339
elementary school junior high school and

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,779
Sydney high school and you can teach you

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:23,140
that student very easy neck laughs yeah

00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:26,470
and pls project you can just to add to

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,860
the website and you can pack it into

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:33,820
loneliness so you can yeah you can you

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,070
can fire the car I can fire human but

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,320
the studio we asked while a yeah wrong

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,200
the sin yeah because we must consider

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:49,480
more so you will consider more you will

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:51,970
you will you know what yeah and i think

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,150
i think the phone education i think not

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,810
just yet not just the loneliness dispute

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,940
i think if we if we want to change the

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:04,210
student users behavior we must start

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,240
from the education for the campers so so

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,270
I'm brave yeah I raced back to relax

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,330
there too we must do cooperate more we

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:17,050
must start with the school and we must

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:20,350
change then and I also tell the ethical

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:24,910
instructor they must right let much more

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:29,080

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,330
source and we must do more shot with the

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,610
open sea will open sewer and the open

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,070
source and we can get more users and

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,550
feedback you know some users behavior

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,160
just they had a habit so you wait if you

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,260
have a book if we have a course when

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,100
next time they they contact to the

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:53,070
nearest they will choose opensuse right

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:58,630
