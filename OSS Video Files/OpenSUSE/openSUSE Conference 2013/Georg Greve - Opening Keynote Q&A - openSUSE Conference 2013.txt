you're excused do we have any comments

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:50,850
or questions or yes I think I don't know

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:53,100
who was first but oh thank you both that

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,649
is very good of you that makes you a

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,230
good developer actually I know quite a

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,399
few people who would do well with that

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,399
attitude let's put it this way

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,100
there is in any any country is going on

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,770
any kind of action that like we in

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,560
Finland for example through the FSA

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,409
chamber in Finland and course we have

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,229
raised this issue of the of the privacy

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:36,970
and especially on the public sector we

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:41,950
have pointed out that for example

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:46,119
Microsoft 365 system is not safe in the

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:48,909
way how the legal or legislation is is

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,300
actually saying that how the public

00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:56,619
officers should be kind of taking care

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,899
of our our data in inside of our country

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,090
now we have raised the issue and say

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,130
that okay that the the contracts what

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,200
you are signing they are not

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,149
guaranteeing that you are able to take

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
down and and check out that where the

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,519
data is so who is taking the

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,489
responsibility and I was so happy when

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:17,709
the soldiers know that of course the

00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:20,140
case is not so happy but what I mean is

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,810
that that finally we gotta prove out of

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,510
that what we have busy and now we are

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,730
kind of planning their that okay since

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,820
we have been you know screaming and

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,680
shouting this fact for a couple of years

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,600
pointing is doubt that we have despite

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,480
the fact that whatever the Microsoft is

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,209
saying who's going to believe and now we

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,880
have the you know the proof on on that

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,060
that ok this is the case now question is

00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,060
that what do you think how hard we

00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,040
should be there I mean I'm so angry

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,290
about this that I'm I'm ready to go to

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,600
the court with thousand you know guys

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,120
and say that even though that we showed

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,540
you we demonstrated you that this is

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,519
possible we say that that the

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,489
legislature are signing is giving the

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,880
freedom for the US government to do

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,569
whatever they want and even despite the

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,579
facts you sign the contracts and you

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,100
volunteer Lee gave the data for them so

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,560
you are the responsible and and now

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,130
that's the case the law there so this is

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,190
a good question and

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,520
i don't know i'm really interested that

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,160
is there such a hangry guys in another

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,200
EU countries because i believe that the

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,990
situation is a pretty similar in other

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,420
countries also yes and I mean you're of

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,340
course entirely right it was known and

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,160
you could have known you should have

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,290
known because there is even official

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,750
statements way before prism from both

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,550
Microsoft and Google saying that it

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,950
doesn't matter where the data is even it

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,230
which data center hosts is completely

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:58,460
irrelevant the US government has access

00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,080
period so you know that it even when you

00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,730
have a contract that says oh yes it'll

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,150
be hosted in Europe it's completely

00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:09,110
irrelevant and we've known that for a

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,690
while that is true so I think this

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,480
Swedish right it wasn't a Swedish Data

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,860
Protection Agency that actually made it

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,780
illegal for public sector to use google

00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,030
the whole like google apps are no longer

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,450
allows for public sector i think that

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:31,610
actually is the right course um i mean

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:33,650
if if not the government who is in a

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,050
position to actually run their own

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,200
systems in a way to protect the

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,030
sovereignty of the nation I mean

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,320
virtually I actually believe that every

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,700
single country should run their own

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,190
infrastructure and they should do it on

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,080
open source um that's the only

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:55,940
sustainable way yeah um the question is

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:59,950
how do we bring that about now suing

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:03,380
them may be effective on a certain level

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:09,050
however be aware that you're not winning

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:17,030
friends this way right so you may create

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:19,340
a counter force to you're trying to act

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,180
upon the fact that they did the wrong

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,640
thing in the past or you may be able to

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,020
actually talk to them first privately

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:34,460
perhaps and say look you know you've

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,900
done this in the past um and we have the

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,120
answer for you to actually

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,280
fix this so how about we now fix this

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,740
because my experience is that even

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,070
politicians usually want to do the right

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,770
thing and it's just that for them being

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,830
so many abstraction levels above what is

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,380
going on in technology it's not quite so

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,449
easy to say what that is because they

00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,919
don't have the competency typically and

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:06,320
they also have a whole lot more subjects

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
all of this then becomes part to the

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,800
political bargaining process right you

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,160
give me something I give you something

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,669
you wanted Microsoft in here so you know

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,770
you then vote for my other bill on this

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:24,470
kind of negotiation is going on the

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:27,349
political system always so perhaps it is

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,650
worth exploring first whether you can

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,380
work with them and if you find out that

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,680
you can't then take stronger measures

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:39,320
but i would not alien I to put alienate

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,789
a potential ally before I know whether

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,490
or not they are an ally or could be made

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,130
into one so strategically speaking I

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:53,680
would propose that we actually engage

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:58,150
with governments everywhere we are and

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:01,070
see who exactly is an ally in this and

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,050
who would be willing to change something

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,820
about it and then work with them because

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,340
they will typically also have the best

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,889
idea of how to bring that change about

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,260
because the point is not ensuing people

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,500
the point is not in you know create

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,789
creating up raw or publicity none of

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,849
that really is important to me what I

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,349
want is that the substance changes and

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,949
so for me the question is what is the

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:26,930
most efficient way of making that happen

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,760
lawsuit may be efficient in that if

00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,710
there's no other way but typically I

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,729
would resort to that only as the last

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,860
option just a little question do you

00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:39,110
happen to know if an FS fe and carstens

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,389
theme if they have approached Nellie

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,599
cross or anybody on the yield level with

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,599
it

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:52,820
well okay I know there is conversations

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,060
always ongoing but I am Not sure to

00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:01,490
which level right now Carson or Matthias

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,820
want any of this is closed so I mean

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,680
they're obviously in touch with EU but I

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,830
would propose actually to have an

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,130
internal round in FS Fe to see where the

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,690
strategic point right now lies but yes I

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,180
mean they're obviously fully aware of

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,950
what's going on and I've I've spoken

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,560
with both of them about the whole prison

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,000
thing so I know that they are not

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,000
unaware of it let's put it this way

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,510
thank you so much I'd like to add to

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,640
that on excellent answer right away I

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,400
think you should not overestimate the

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,380
role a politician plays actually in the

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,980
decision-making process of which

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,500
software is actually used in a local or

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,870
national government actually it's in my

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,390
experience from 10 years in a dutch

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,350
government it's almost always a

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:03,080
technical first decision for the past 25

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,150
years this decision has been very simple

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,090
stick to what we know which is the

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,680
microsoft way of things actually in the

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:14,540
netherlands there are several groups of

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,020
open-source business owners including

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,540
mine for example we have just

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,150
established duple overhead group all the

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,440
content management system is one of the

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,040
systems and used by the dutch government

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,340
by several dutch government and actually

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,310
instead of fighting each other group of

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,830
suppliers decided to team up and

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,590
actually build some universal modules

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,680
and themes for the dutch government to

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:45,260
use this effectively enabled the dutch

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,540
government to use Drupal with these

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,810
modules and themes as a standard

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,110
installation level playing field so they

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,960
still could do their European tenders on

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,490
the platform but from this shared base

00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
and personally I believe this is the

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,240
weight

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,340
go I don't think politicians are that

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,900
much involved into technology nor should

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,650
they be because actually in the

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:13,490
Netherlands we had law passed it was the

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,030
Moche vendrick named by case fendrich

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,500
the politician from green left and

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,710
actually this had a completely

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,800
counterproductive effect because most IT

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,930
departments saw it they did not perceive

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,360
their current problem as vendor lock-in

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,630
they perceived the new problem as

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,600
fendrich login they had to use open

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,920
source and they simply didn't want to

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,230
they wanted to stick to what they know

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,180
so I think the way forward is simply

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,680
cooperating create a couple of good

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,690
standardized business cases of open

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,480
source software in which all businesses

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,120
can participate this is of course

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,430
preaching to the choir I think but I

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,520
think this is the way to go suing is

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,460
almost always counterproductive thank

00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,200
you for listening you've got a new

00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,900
microphone I saw a question over there

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:12,970
actually should I go that way I think he

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:18,050
was first actually so I'm waving before

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:23,420
thanks sir your proposals for government

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:25,990
are fine and my question is what about

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,290
for the enterprise one of the big issues

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,720
preventer prize is data center costs

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:37,690
they are a significant portion of the

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:41,240
righty budget problem is there were no

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:44,060
European public cloud vendors that would

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,700
then have to abide by EU law at present

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,010
the major cloud vendors are all us-based

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:55,490
and as such any data stored on their kin

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:59,740
and relatively easily will be handed

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:06,770
over to US government should they wish

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:11,000
how do you see what what's your

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,920
suggestion for getting a EU based

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,480
cloud provider similar times and all

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,820
Rackspace etc that could then enable

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,950
enterprises of all sizes whether it be

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:28,160
SMBs SMEs etc to be able to take control

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,440
of their own software and data but not

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,600
necessarily have to worry about the

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:38,120
underlying costs to run that software on

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:44,180
top that is a very good question also

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:47,720
tricky one I believe there may actually

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,470
be a case now for political intervention

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,140
even I mean we built for strategic

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,520
reasons Airbus for instance as an

00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:00,470
alternative to Boeing we may have to do

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,950
something similar in the data center

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:05,750
space if no one else steps up I think

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,080
there should be an obvious demand now so

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:11,030
I do hope that some VCS at least are

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,300
paying some attention because there's

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:17,390
obviously demand for European run data

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,370
centers so I would hope that you know

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:23,600
someone would actually step up to do

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:27,080
that unfortunately you know usually when

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,130
you say someone but sometimes means no

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,990
one unless you're willing to do it

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,930
yourself but I'm kind of busy right now

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:37,630
so ultimately though I think there is a

00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:41,210
business case here and I would hope that

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:45,740
whoever is out there with a certain

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:48,170
entrepreneurial tendency takes this ball

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,050
and runs with it because I would prefer

00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,950
that greatly to requiring governmental

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,620
intervention but if nothing else helps

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,640
then I think strategically speaking oh

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,820
that is what government should be doing

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,710
because it's not in the interest of a

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,860
government to see its own industry

00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:09,740
purely at the mercy or from the

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,490
international interests of some other

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:16,070
country um there is just no strategic

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,260
sense in letting that kind of dependency

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,390
exist you do want a certain level of

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,190
control some countries have understood

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,380
this by the way unfortunately none of

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:29,960
them are European

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:32,990
but Brazil to highlight one has

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,360
understood this pretty well starting

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,410
from financial independence II I mean

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,400
paying back its debt to the World Bank

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:44,450
essentially saying we're debt-free now

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,080
you can tell us nothing there is a very

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,930
very clear understanding that

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,940
independence is a value but China as

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,060
well I mean China obviously wanted

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,250
control over of the entire chain

00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,670
including the chips to be able to

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,050
produce what they need themselves so

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,310
they know exactly what's going on in

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:11,600
there and I think we have a bit to learn

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:15,230
from them India its space program is it

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,030
purely strategic endeavor on some level

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,130
where they actually say we need the

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,740
space program to not be dependent upon

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:25,040
other nations so we can actually launch

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,290
satellite into space without requiring

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,530
someone else's carrier system so

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,480
countries do and for very good reason

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,250
make strategic holes on this is such a

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,230
crucial piece of infrastructure so

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:40,130
important to us we need to do something

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:42,440
about it if the market the invisible

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:46,010
hand whatever it doesn't magically bring

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,650
it then our job is to make sure that the

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,500
strategic interests of our people of our

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,230
country are protected and so yeah I mean

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,670
I think that this may actually be just

00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:01,730
such a case because it's surely

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:04,730
important enough yes i am very done last

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,650
question and we are closing ok good

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,860
morning and thank you for your

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,990
enlightening keynote i would like to ask

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,840
a question that kind of borderline some

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,110
paranoia and conspiracy theory but we do

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,420
have a conspiracy in or before our eyes

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:24,980
my question is that if it if we impose a

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,110
open source and we know what go what's

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,470
going on everywhere how can we be sure

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:33,410
that we actually know what is going on

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,589
and how can we know that they are they

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,699
don't actually have a secret project

00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,299
like prism

00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:44,269
anytime that's why I really I mean I if

00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,799
we have a listen election system that is

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:48,230
open source and everyone knows how it

00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,689
works how can we know that this is the

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,139
actual system that counts the votes and

00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:56,359
not some other system that is true and

00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,519
actually a voting is one of the areas

00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:01,699
where I still remain to be convinced

00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,199
that there is a way to do it arm that

00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:04,610
holds up to all the democratic

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,079
principles I actually still believe

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:10,669
paper is still the best way of voting I

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,470
mean I know technology so it's like I'm

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:14,000
sorry but I not convinced because

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,649
there's too many ways to manipulate it

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,490
and you're exactly right you don't know

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:21,529
what is running on there um so yes I

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,809
think actually that perhaps not

00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:25,880
everything should be purely based on

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:31,250
technology I think voting is one of

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,720
those examples but other than that yes I

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,809
mean those programs will continue to

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,789
exist it's just that it's going to be

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,679
much much harder and it's a much higher

00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:43,850
cost trying to get access to information

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,279
I mean security is is is about the cost

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,460
versus the benefit right because no

00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,919
system is ever perfectly secure I mean

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,570
every system will be breached at some

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,760
point if you have a sufficiently

00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:00,649
dedicated motivated attacker no matter

00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,870
what we try or what we do in the end

00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:05,450
it's about raising the cost for for

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,539
breaking the system and open source

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,760
allows us to do that very efficiently

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:14,779
plus it is harder to hide back doors um

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,210
I mean perhaps not impossible given the

00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:19,820
complexity of the software so I would

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,289
not stand up and say it is guaranteed

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,299
there will be no back doors ever and

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,960
open source because we all know how

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:29,720
complex this is by now so there's

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,510
been even one guy from the BSD community

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,340
who stood up and said my NDA is up the

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,299
NSA paid me to put it back door and BSD

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,010
um so I mean no one knows whether that's

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:41,389
actually true no one knows whether it

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,919
back to our still continues to exist and

00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:51,580
so and so forth but there's been cases

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:54,830
like this so yes we don't fully know but

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:58,220
we have the chance to check we have the

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,200
ability to look at things and we have a

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,330
much higher probability and it's in the

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,670
end it's all about statistics a much

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,530
higher probability that actually we will

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:08,480
find whatever is wrong with that code

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,610
and that that back door even if it gets

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,440
put in there will be you know patched

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,380
out by the next patch not mainly not

00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:19,460
even for security reasons for some other

00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:22,520
functional reasons it's all possible in

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:28,000
the end open source is not a perfect

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:30,740
answer but technically it's the best and

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,150
software freedom politically and

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:39,830
socially clearly is the far superior

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:43,730
answer so um is it perfect no but then

00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,700
what is I mean really um it's clearly

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,820
the better answer so we owe it to all of

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,050
us and society to take it and make sure

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:57,670
it gets everywhere so that's it my

00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,670
