Title: Bernhard Wiedemann - openQA.o.o - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Testing an Operating System from bootloader through installer to the applications of the installed system is a lot of hard work and doing this daily is rather exhausting and boring, so I made openQA (using my OS-autoinst test-engine) to do it all for me... or rather us openSUSE users.
This has meanwhile been running since 2010 and found many many bugs, some of which would surely have made it into GM without being noticed.
This talk will give some overview on the why, what and how of our automated testing with a discussion of further plans for improvement.
