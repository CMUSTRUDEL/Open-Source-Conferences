Title: Oliver Neukum - The state of USB 3.0 - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	This talk focuses on USB 3.0 compared to USB 2.0, its conceptual changes, new features and the state of the implementation in the kernel.

I'll do a short overview of the changes at the hardware level.
That includes the dropping of companion controllers, addressing done in hardware and the introduction of a new mid-level, which is called "function", into the device architecture.

The main new features covered are stream support and new features of power management at the function and link level.
The kernel API for streams is introduced and the extension to usbfs is discussed. The automatic link level power states are featured.

The state of the XHCI support in the kernel is described. How the device model fails to represent the function level is discussed.
