Title: Michal Hrusecky - Getting ready for the key signing party - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Do you want to get your key signed? Do you want to have SSL certificate signed? Not that everybody will trust it, but at least quite some people will. Are you planning to participate in key signing party but not sure what to do afterward? This talk is meant for beginners and will show you some basics and will prepare you for the party (the key signing one).

okay so hi everybody thank you for

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,320
showing up and let's start first three

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,379
words from our sponsor Souza is hiring

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,210
if you want to have nice and interesting

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:25,740
job talk to our guys at the booth and

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:28,529
now to the key signing party a little

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:35,309
bit about motivation why do we want to

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:37,520
actually sign and crypt stuff this is

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,950
the classic example of cryptography

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,770
there is a girl it's she's called Alice

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,559
and she meets a bob and they want to

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,640
chat they like each other but there is

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,699
this melody guy who likes Alice and

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,480
wants to break them apart and there's

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,969
this eve who likes Bob but she's shy and

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,790
she's not that dangerous as mellowing

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:09,060
and Melanie actually works in is peace

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,780
is B who provides internet connection to

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,640
Alice so he can spy on her and he can

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,060
pretend to be her and if it's just a

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,970
harmless stalker that follows Bob

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:31,530
everywhere so if a days and Bob wants to

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,799
have good relationship and want to talk

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,259
to each other and want to share some

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,570
secret stuff like where are they going

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,369
for vacation and don't want to be

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:48,689
disturbed night by eve or Mallory they

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:54,750
need to encrypt the data before they

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:58,259
send them and they have to know that the

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,869
other party is actually Alice or Bob and

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:06,479
that nobody is trying to get between

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:09,720
them and problem with the males and that

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,050
in general is that communication is

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,840
mostly plain text

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:22,910
we can have some HTTPS and stuff like

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:29,150
that but you need to know who it's hard

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:32,090
to verify and encourage anybody can

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:38,660
pretend to be anybody generally that's

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:42,980
mostly to for males and males are relate

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:48,080
to multiple machines so you are not sure

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,940
who read your males so males are

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,260
traveling through a long way and

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,960
everybody's reading them and yeah you

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:04,220
don't know who are all these people and

00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:07,730
what are their intentions yeah NSA and a

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:13,480
bunch of other guys and yeah maybe some

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:17,630
of them are evil not nice guys from NSA

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,690
so something about theory about people

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:28,750
to graffiti I'm not going to go any deep

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:34,120
there are two main two main ways how to

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:38,180
do Krypton the Eider there are somatic

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:42,560
ciphers they use same key for encryption

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,580
and decryption and both parties have to

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,900
share the same secret and it's hard to

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:55,300
exchange this secret key or you can use

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:59,810
a symmetric ciphers which has two keys

00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:03,050
public and private and when Alice wants

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:08,120
to send something to Bob she uses her

00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:11,660
private and Bob's public and sends it to

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:18,140
Bob and Bob then uses Alice's public key

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:20,479
and a private key to decrypt it these a

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,670
symmetric ciphers are generally slower

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,280
than symmetric ones and

00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,310
it's not hard to exchange keys because

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,650
they are there you can put your public

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,380
key on the web that's not a problem but

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,130
problem is how do I find it it's

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:45,190
actually you and not some mellow a guy

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:48,580
who is injecting key in the middle so

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:52,840
let's start with PGP that we will be

00:04:48,580 --> 00:05:02,920
signing keys afterwards little bit of

00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:06,100
history in 1977 RSA started in 1991 PGP

00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:12,700
started and it was made available

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:17,620
including sources and in 1992 there was

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:22,030
web of trust protocol available in pgp 2

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:25,630
point 0 and in 1993 us i started

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:30,390
criminal investigation of the outer of

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:35,670
PGP they started it because he violated

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:42,880
munition exports without license because

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:49,360
cryptography were considered munition so

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:53,170
he in 1995 to prove how stupid it is he

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,770
created a book where he printed all the

00:05:53,170 --> 00:06:00,040
sources of PGP and started selling this

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,320
book and shipping it outside so nobody

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,690
could actually download the sources

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,160
directly from him they just they just

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:12,630
could order the book take it apart scan

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,630
it and compile it

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:26,069
yeah freedom of speech so in 1996

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:33,509
criminal investigation ended and in 1997

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:42,729
openpgp bill was proposed to some is

00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:46,030
IETF whatever and in 1998 we've got IFC

00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:52,360
which specifies the message format so

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:59,110
now it's open standard and in 1999 we

00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:02,830
got gpg so features we've got two keys

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:07,659
public and private it can sign it can

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:11,729
encrypt data it is decentralized you

00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:15,129
don't need any central authority nobody

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,219
you can just start exchanging keys with

00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:21,520
your friends and there are two ways how

00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:24,520
you can sign or crypt staff either you

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,719
can use in line method which just marks

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:33,639
part of your mails and or you can just

00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:37,960
attach something to your mail how it

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:42,550
works it actually uses both of the

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:45,039
ciphers as I said in the beginning there

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,090
are symmetric ones and assign metric

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:53,710
ones somatic ones are fast as I magnetic

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:59,770
ones are slow so what do they do they

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:04,110
use a somatic want to encrypt the shared

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:13,090
secret of symmetric cipher then they

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:15,940
they use so we will get a key for C for

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,029
symmetric cipher we will encrypt it

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:23,620
using a symmetric cipher and then we use

00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:27,339
the text and encrypt it using that key

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,569
for symmetric cipher and both both

00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,749
things we will put

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:35,560
into email and send it out on the other

00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:38,409
end we will get the first part out and

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,539
then using the a symmetric cipher we

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,729
will decrypt the key and then we will

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,630
use the key to the Crypt actually the

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:52,329
text so we can get advantages of both

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:55,259
and now to the practical star we will be

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:57,940
having key signing party in a minute or

00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,180
not in the minute but after this talk

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,420
and there is a great tool that can help

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:09,339
you with designing parties it's a

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:17,440
package called signing party and what we

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:20,860
want from that is to call calf Oh tricky

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,339
part is that it requires working send

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,490
mail or some alternative and what it

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,639
does is that it downloads the key from

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:32,560
some public key server shows you the

00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,250
fingerprint of the person that you are

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,529
trying to verify you will verify it then

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,579
you will confirm it it will assign the

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:45,639
key and then it will send each identity

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:50,680
to the owner of that identity over the

00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:53,680
mail this is important part because it

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,970
also verifies that you actually are able

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,350
to access that mail so let's say that

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:06,850
you will sign my key and use this tool

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:11,439
then as I have multiple identities in my

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:13,540
key it will sign only one of these each

00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:18,100
one of these identities and tell me just

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:20,980
the sign one sign identity to every male

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,470
that I have listed there only the

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,410
correct one and if I'm if I put some

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:30,339
random mail in there and I'm not able to

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:35,860
get it then I'm not able to get the

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:39,130
signature for that mail how you how do

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,279
you use it its command line tool you

00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:47,350
will you just need to die

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:56,350
calf and part of the fingerprint the end

00:10:47,350 --> 00:11:00,069
part of the gpg key and it will show the

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:06,220
identities that you want to sign it will

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:09,279
show the fingerprint and that then it

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,910
will allow you to sign and it will ask

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,699
you what do you want to send it so it's

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:22,829
pretty easy you don't need to deal with

00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:27,029
gpg directly and it's user friendly now

00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:31,149
only thing that you need to set up is

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:35,759
some stuff like your email and keys that

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:41,230
you want to use to sign stuff and maybe

00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:45,220
how to send emails how to send emails so

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:49,660
if you don't want to deal with setting

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:55,480
up your mail server and well nobody will

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:58,660
trust you anyway because so if you set

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,699
it up on your laptop probably everybody

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,240
else in the world would think that you a

00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:07,990
spammer and we'll just drop your email

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:14,559
so good idea how to overcome this is to

00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:18,459
use em smtp this is a tool that behaves

00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:22,930
like send mail but it actually connects

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:26,829
to another smtp server and sends emails

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:30,639
to that this is one of the commands that

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:33,639
you can use this actually creates a

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,779
queue of emails and then you can send

00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:43,269
them at once and this is the

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:45,809
configuration of ms empty p how it looks

00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:52,660
like it's pretty simple you just need to

00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:55,100
say where to connect what is the

00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:00,650
username and what is the password and

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:04,940
maybe some stuff like board maybe some

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:10,520
stuff like where is this certificate so

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:14,930
it can use secure connection now little

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:19,840
bit about ssl and see i said we can do

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:27,020
see i said as well today at least i hope

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:30,620
because yeah we will get to that so what

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:34,780
it does basically bind public key to

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:37,840
some name and it uses mostly

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:43,460
hierarchical approach so we've got these

00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:46,550
certification outro at ease and oh I put

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:50,350
there I forget the old link there I had

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:53,510
this talk in Iraq and I forgot a link to

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,940
check site how to generate ssl keys but

00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:02,420
I believe you are clever enough to

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:07,370
google it up so it works that like that

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:14,540
that there is some list of trusted CIS

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:18,650
and they signs your keys usually they do

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:22,460
some verification and quite often they

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:27,230
require some payment and only after that

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:32,600
they will sign your key this is our

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:39,680
example of session how ssl works in

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:44,570
short it's similar to gpg again they

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:52,700
will try to negotiate some way to

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:55,160
communicate and then using a symmetric

00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:01,760
cipher and then they will use somatic

00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:06,120
one so what is see a set suicide is

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:12,900
nonprofit founded in 2003

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:16,050
and it's robot CA so it means that most

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,779
of the stuff is done automatically they

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:23,610
will just verify that domain is really

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:28,980
yours they were verified by asking you

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:31,860
to either modify dns records or to put

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,779
something on your web server so they

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:46,080
don't know that you in fact have a

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:50,070
control over the domain and all they can

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:57,870
send email to the route that that domain

00:15:50,070 --> 00:16:01,650
yeah and they've got they are based also

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:05,100
on web of trust and they've got system

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,880
of usher's it works like that once you

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:12,080
are sure you can issue some points to be

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,930
to people after you verify the identity

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,959
when you get 50 points you are

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:21,450
considered verified and this

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,959
certification outer it will trust that

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:29,430
you are actually you and once you get

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:34,589
100 points you are able to allocate new

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:43,170
points to new users and by the way it

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:48,810
signs pgps as well so that was what I

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:54,930
had what I wanted to talk about now how

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:57,330
do we do the actual designing either you

00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,320
bring your paper slips with your

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:06,089
fingerprints or put your fingerprint on

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:09,089
your slide aside it and we will go

00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:13,829
outside and we will exchange these paper

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:16,920
slips and we will show each other ID so

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,970
we will trust each other at least for a

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:25,589
while and apart from

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:29,550
we've got some forms to do ca ca said

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,830
assurance on opensuse booze so if you

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:36,000
are interested in that one we can do

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:40,080
that as well I'm able to allocate some

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,100
points to you I believe VN Weber is also

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,320
able I will just need to hunt him down

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,410
so we've got three guys that are able to

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,690
give you some point so from this

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:56,820
conference you can go home and be

00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:03,990
trusted by csr so do you won't want to

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:06,510
not want to say something ok so if you

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:11,430
well if you have any questions do you

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:14,730
have any questions no so we will meet at

00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,800
the registration desk if you don't have

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,730
your paper slips don't worry we can

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,610
print it for you and leave a sign our

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,950
keys so thank you for your attention and
