Title: Georg Greve - Kolab 3.1: Groupware Done Right - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	Introduction, overview and primer for application and system integrators

The Kolab Groupware Solution is the most scalable groupware solution. It is also the one with the most beautiful web interface, integrating and providing the basis for the Roundcube web mailer, used in hundreds of thousands of installation. And it Open Standards to the core, all the way down to the storage protocol. Networked, secure and available as fully Free Software even in its Enterprise Edition, Kolab is the groupware for the free world. The workshop will provide an introduction into Kolab architecture, the exciting new features of the 3.1 release (now with iRony and Chwala!) its packaging and deployment for OpenSuSE and SLE. The workshop will also provide pointers how to get involved in Kolab or integrate your own software with it, which is made extremely easy by libkolab, which exposes its API to various programming languages.

grrrrrr grievant considered we talked to

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:17,730
us about the Kolob 3.1 hello hello okay

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:24,740
this works actually I prefer to sin city

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,740
feels weird alright so welcome everyone

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:36,270
pop pop up one two three okay welcome to

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,660
the colab group we're on workshop we had

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,219
to move this slightly ahead from the

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,489
initial schedule so this is actually

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,010
what was planned to be a workshop format

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,840
which is what we're going to do since I

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,590
unfortunately have to be a little bit

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,660
earlier that I've you know ideally would

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,910
have since tomorrow afternoon I'll be

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,430
heading out back home since on Sunday

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,020
it's my boys birthday so I have private

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,339
obligations which I hope you forgive me

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,659
for louder okay so it's one of the mics

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,119
that you actually have to like almost

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,220
hold to your chin so we will do a

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,750
workshop session on the colab grouper

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,659
solution trying to give you an idea a

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,930
what is called a prepare what have we

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,049
done the three technology base tell you

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,869
a little bit about the 3.1 release what

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,670
is coming now and we actually thought

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,619
we'd be daring and bold and just show

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,770
you how easy it is to get caught up on

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,390
to open Susie so I'm Han staccato is one

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,400
of our community members as well as a

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,189
business generator around I'm opensuse

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,780
and co lop heads column here to do this

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,420
with me initially we would have loved to

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,070
also have an asd Isley here who should

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,320
get all the credit for the packaging in

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,810
fact next time we will bring him

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,700
absolutely we will find a way but like

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,990
this he's now been very very busy making

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:07,170
sure that the packages are smoothly

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,450
going towards 3.1 now so 3.1 should

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,140
become available very soon I understand

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,590
um in like days essentially on opensuse

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,590
so this

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,230
the 3.0 install but the 3.1 in school

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,660
will be exactly the same thing because

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,480
there's no major differences I mean if

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,120
your future release arm which means you

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,959
know just more good stuff but no

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,190
dramatic changes so hunts you want to

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:37,519
unplug me here for a second and then

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,519
show off

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,849
yeah ideally we have like a switch Spock

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,689
unfortunately we don't so and this whole

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,970
format is intentionally I would like it

00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:55,470
to have it a bit more interactive we

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,360
can't if you have any questions at any

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,010
point in time if you're wondering about

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,260
something just raise your hand you know

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:08,370
that's let's not do this in pure frontal

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:10,109
assault meadow good morning actually I

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,829
want to talk you through what i already

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,690
have been doing on this insole actually

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,180
not that much the only thing i actually

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,579
tested was would it be possible to add

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,480
the repositories that anise so kindly

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,720
provided actually I will be following

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,310
mostly the steps outlined in a nice blog

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,069
post on the Colorado org community site

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:39,090
obviously this is as Garrett mentioned

00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:42,510
three point oh not 3.1 yet which looks

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,440
by the way really exciting anus is in

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,519
the process of packaging 3.1 but let's

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,269
not tempt fate too much and do a three

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,500
point oh actually what I did was grab a

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:02,940
clean 12.3 live KDE release and install

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:07,199
it on a virtual box then I added the

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,230
repositories and really I didn't do

00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:15,090
anything else so here we go we have

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,709
zipper install kolob which will of

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,099
course now result in a flawless

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:25,440
installation and actually while I'm

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,570
doing this waiting for this I'm actually

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,560
hoping that it will start to install

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:35,250
fast which is always it a little bit

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,260
tempting on virtual machines but we'll

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,110
see how this works anybody here actually

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:46,139
done the install of Kolob already right

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:48,449
everybody of course or nobody you did

00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,310
yeah of course all right cool actually

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,310
as you see now zipper has run through

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,639
the dependency check and has concluded

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,860
that it needs only 178 new

00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,599
packages to insole which obviously gives

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,969
Garrett a chance to enlighten us a bit

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:06,050
more about the 3.1 in Seoul I am going

00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:08,090
to press yes and enter and have all the

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,460
faith in the world that this will end up

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,199
in a workable basic installation which

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:18,620
we will demo further thank you thank you

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,900
very much now I know that some people

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,099
actually claim here not even quite

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:28,029
knowing what hold up fully is um so I've

00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:30,020
just pulled up a slide from the

00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:32,569
presentation that toast and go to our

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:39,409
evangelist gave i think in spain at some

00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:42,620
point and so just very very briefly cool

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:47,719
app is a group where solution that means

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,750
it comes with server and client and it

00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,969
does what group are commonly does so

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,349
email calendar address book tasks and

00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:59,180
since 3.1 now also files um it has

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:03,189
multiple clients for all sorts of

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,319
platforms it pushes to the mobile device

00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:08,509
on any common platform through

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,330
activesync it has full offline

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,919
capabilities it is an extremely scalable

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,789
i will show you a bit of the server-side

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:18,020
architecture in a moment and it is a one

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,330
hundred percent free software and this

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,159
is a very important part for us we are a

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,159
hundred percent open source free

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:27,379
software business we do not have any

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:30,589
proprietary extensions any proprietary

00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:32,839
modules any new proprietary business

00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:35,120
models no open core of any kind our

00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:37,490
business model is very similar to what

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,740
redhead and zuza also do it is

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,050
essentially a certified binary stream on

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,629
that comes from our build servers that

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,460
we maintain for our customers where

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:49,849
customers then have the chance to get a

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,710
five-year stable support cycle which we

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,330
will then support and when they have

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,870
issues we both resultant for them and

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,669
all the services around that it is to

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,529
the largest extent an open

00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,349
standards-based solution as well and

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:05,990
that means including all the way down to

00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:09,280
the storage layer so

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,440
storage layer you will see is based on a

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,310
set of open standards the most basic one

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,370
bi map because i'm cole abuses and imap

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:24,830
server as its load-bearing database so

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,370
all the contacts all the calendar is all

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,740
the tasks even all the files if you want

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,720
end up 9 episode which you can

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,420
practically scale to any size of

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,520
deployment as I learned this is actually

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,660
not totally unlike what groupwise has

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,850
done in a basic fundamental design only

00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,430
that when group what was done and there

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,870
was no email so they just have a

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,670
file-based store on on the disk through

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,640
i met we effectively have the same thing

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,590
only an i'm in in imap format which

00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,560
means I'm appliance at a very easy way

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:06,020
of accessing the system and those I'm

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,240
app store objects then are essentially

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,690
small emails with an XML attachment that

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,330
XML attachment is an X Cal X card format

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,850
so you actually have an open standard

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,740
all the way down to the storage layer so

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,330
all you need to do if you ever want to

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,860
migrate out of it or if you want to

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,560
process that information in any other

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,140
way is actually be able to handle xkx

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,660
card um that's all you need to do and

00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,190
you are installation alright well let me

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,830
just finish the last point and you get

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,570
the get the viewer back and the the last

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,030
part that is important to understand

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,490
about Cola is it's a very security

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:47,630
centric architecture on the background

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,250
of Cola is with the German office for

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,680
information security it's part of the

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,170
Ministry of the Interior which required

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,720
a group of solution back in the early

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,310
2000s and couldn't find anything that

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
would fit it criteria its criteria

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,570
including being a hundred percent open

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,400
source on so they did want something

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,230
that they could audit all the way down

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,470
that would give them a multi-platform

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,600
capability they couldn't find anything

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,630
in the market so they launched a tender

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,630
a consortium of companies warm that

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,580
tender and then developed Cola for the

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,970
BSI initially which is where it is still

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,120
being you

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,269
until the day um but since everything

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,009
was developed as free software it was

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,139
then also taken further by those

00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:33,319
companies until we started call up

00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:35,180
systems a few years ago but before that

00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,459
there was also a set of companies

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,279
working around the project as well as

00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:43,339
volunteers from all over the place so it

00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,199
has a background in security feel in the

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:50,360
public sector but has evolved out of

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:54,230
that thank you I thought it might be fun

00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,209
to give a little insight in what my gums

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,790
all is actually doing at the moment so

00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:05,839
I'm making just to do something yeah

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:10,459
that seems to work actually installing

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:13,579
co-op in previous versions was actually

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,610
a bit daunting the implementation

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:19,459
originally done by the consortium just

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:21,800
mentioned made use of a lot of open

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:25,670
source components standard mail server

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,029
and PHP or maybe not bhp at that time

00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,670
because the web front end is new but

00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:34,160
actually what they decided to do was in

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,230
previous versions they wrap around a lot

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,529
of functionality around the standard

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,819
packages so actually basically an

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,819
installation of Kolob would look like

00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:44,990
I'm installing everything from scratch

00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,519
ok and now I'm going to redo the

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,449
insulation with all the color patches

00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:53,750
attached which basically was like rpm

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:57,279
masochism for advanced people in color

00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:00,350
tree what they excellently did was seek

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,680
connection to upstream a lot of patches

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:08,300
have been given back upstream for a lot

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,860
of projects and they incorporated also a

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,449
web client called brown cube which

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,370
basically started as a different project

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:18,850
but I think they've pretty much

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:21,170
assimilated or at least carry on

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,370
installation well as you can see a lot

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:30,740
of standard modules are now installed

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:33,620
perl python MF SD it also has fired

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,900
checking out of the box installed so

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,800
since the installation phase it now at

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,360
like 30 from 178 packages actually

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,730
everything just has been downloaded it's

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,850
now instantly I'm going to get back to

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:52,930
microphone to bear thank you um so what

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:58,450
I have here on the screen for you is a

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,450
ugly yet hopefully somewhat functional

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,580
diagram of how a cool app server looks

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,060
like we're server meets like the concept

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,900
conceptual thing of a server because

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,710
there can be quite a few machines

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:19,660
actually involved in this whole thing um

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:23,839
the gray box here is a purely functional

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,110
in the end but what you see is it is

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,200
built around a Cyrus I map by default we

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,990
can also be stuffed up those are the two

00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:38,209
options that are working for quite a few

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:41,270
users um you have all the database

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:43,700
effectively or email all the actual load

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,100
in here which means from a backup and

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,890
restore perspective if you pack that up

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,080
you have all your payload and that is

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:54,470
always single files which means it's

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:58,339
very easy to backup and restore so we

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:01,100
can do on things like you pull that one

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:03,470
calendar entry from you know three years

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,940
ago that was accidentally deleted out of

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,220
the backup you throw it back in you

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,170
regenerate the index on Cyrus and

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,529
suddenly you have that calendar entry

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,560
back in your actual original location in

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:17,450
the calendar um so you don't need like

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,310
many others to set up a second system

00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,660
where you restore it all and then

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,100
somehow you know pull out of the

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,990
database whatever object you were

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,220
interested in you can actually just pick

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,220
the one object you require

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,540
yes exactly so I mean because it said it

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,920
went to imap server it's now either

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,110
Cyrus or cough cough at the moment I

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,160
mean those are the two actual options we

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,920
have a default for Cyrus because we find

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,520
that in a lot of enterprises and it has

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,560
a very wide support community so we are

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,560
both the Cyrus I'm a project ourselves

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,600
in fact the architect of the quota

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,740
proper solution your information is also

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,760
the Cyrus release manager so we have a

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,350
intimate relationship there and

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,970
contribute to the project but we also

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,380
have a good relationship to t-mo and the

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,490
doctor project so that's a pure

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,850
preference of Technology if you will

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,340
that we leave up to the users both

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,440
servers obviously scale up to any number

00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,010
of users and any amount of data that you

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,860
require I mean terabytes hundreds of

00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,330
thousands of users it's not a problem

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,370
you can do this in different ways with

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,420
Cyrus I know you can do it with

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:41,000
different ways with delicate as well so

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,000
from a system architecture perspective

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,260
it really doesn't matter all but the

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,780
imap server needs to do is it needs to

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,300
support the item standard and the

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,180
metadata RC because the metadata RFC is

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,820
what we use to store the information on

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,610
the folders that says this a calendar

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,160
folder this is an address book so in

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,160
that case the clients then no not to

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,800
display that to the user I'm short as a

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,100
calendar or an Edison instead that's all

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,960
it requires it's very simple really but

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,590
I think simplicity is good for these men

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,830
systems then you have typically poss

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:21,650
tricks I mean I think it's the default

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:24,020
MTA the whole upset you have the colab

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,310
demon which actually listens to the

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,590
directory server which is typically

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,390
elder based we use a lot of 389 so the

00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,600
redhead directory server openldap works

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,840
as well many other options exist just as

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,070
well so you can buy now hook this into

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,750
any directory server that you might have

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,600
we have even natively run this again

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,670
Active Directory just for the hell

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,249
we've got rid of all the schema

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,800
extensions that pull up to hat and can

00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,470
now just run pull up against virtually

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,029
whatever you have so it's fully

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,189
integrate able into any pre-existing

00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,779
environment which in the enterprise is

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,149
important right because no one wants to

00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,290
exchange their directory service because

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:08,240
they're introducing another grouper

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:10,100
deployment that's not really um then of

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,620
course spam filtering status is the

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,829
usual i would say kind of nothing

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,839
nothing new here what is important to

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:21,199
understand is that every one of these

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,009
boxes represents one or more servers

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:27,139
effectively so typically the community

00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,899
install for make so that easy to install

00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:32,899
it all on one server will be on one box

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,449
but you can essentially take every piece

00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:37,279
of this and put it onto a server or

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:41,360
cluster including with redundancy

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,100
including across datacenters because all

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,040
of these opponents talk to each other

00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,660
through secure network protocols which

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,430
means you have a scalability where you

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,139
can actually scale at the bottleneck you

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,029
can say all right and I'll see I have

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,180
too much load on the imap so I need more

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,189
more I met capacity or I see that my

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,649
spam filtering stack against the

00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:02,870
problems I throw it more in there or

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,030
what's coming is actually also web

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,620
servers taking up some power depending

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:11,120
on how many concurrent sessions I have

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:13,280
so the web servers running the wrong

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,079
cube web interface around the base web

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,799
interface I should say we've been

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:23,000
working with contributing to Devon cube

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,740
community since its 0.7 release two of

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,110
the main office around you actually work

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,679
for pull up systems and do this as their

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,740
day job so zero point seven point eight

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,850
point nine and 10 point 0 we're all

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,799
massively based and work that you did

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,649
with pull up systems but we give

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,600
everything back and Thomas brutally who

00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:43,880
is the architect initial also around you

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,669
is the guy who makes the call whether or

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,179
not disclosed into roundcube proper or

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:52,010
into a cool app repository where some of

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,270
the other modules live also a hundred

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,850
percent free software but he says

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,870
roundcube in his vision was also always

00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:58,520
webmail

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,290
he didn't want it to be more complex

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,110
than that so it's his call for the

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,910
project I don't have any say that nor

00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,100
does anyone else it's purely the wrong

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,900
key project managing itself so we have

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,520
not simulated them that's very important

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,260
for me because we try to do right by the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,059
community we're all from the community I

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,580
should know my background you know that

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm rough on the community as well so we

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,430
actually try to do this right we take

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:28,460
pains and doing some then we have an

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:31,190
active site stack synchrotron which we

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,920
by the way the co-developed together

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,940
with the time 20 people so you know to

00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,950
free software group where is working

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,050
together to solve the activesync problem

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,830
and say let's get a proper stack in here

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:47,720
that actually works well so that's what

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,570
we use their it's also running in the

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,170
web server and now for 3.1 you can

00:18:50,570 --> 00:19:00,140
imagine another third box which is a foe

00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:02,630
of the web on the web access for file

00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:05,300
store that also does then webdav it does

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,120
cal data card death as well to expose

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,850
the entire dev suit to on the client so

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,640
that way you can actually scale all of

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,670
this over web servers and that gray box

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,429
here I mean one you have the my sequel

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,780
for the caching of the activesync

00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:23,750
metadata so you know what is it as we

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,130
push to the mobile phone or not for some

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:31,820
roundcube configuration data and

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:34,190
otherwise purely for purposes of you

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,800
know look looking at improving the

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,470
performance in terms of three requests

00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,880
just your passion and it's also used of

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,850
course by the death to layer them as

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,070
well but the simple old server can in

00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,350
theory die and you will never lose any

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,840
productive data you will lose a few user

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,610
settings if you've stored them in there

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,010
which is the default but that's about it

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,920
I mean you know the whole maybe the user

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,690
loses their predefined skin reference

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,730
that they made in the web client that's

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,990
about it because everything else will be

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,840
rebuilt from here

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,770
because the data is here and director

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,640
server which way of indication is so

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:15,020
it's a fairly simple design but powerful

00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,550
and allows us to actually have

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,420
installations with hundreds of thousands

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:23,000
of users and but also scale down by the

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,679
way which we think is cute we have one

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,770
community member who's actually brought

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,920
the Pollock server onto Raspberry Pi

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,540
which i think is funny the practical

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,610
value is perhaps limited because a web

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,200
server on a Raspberry Pi truly doesn't

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,240
have a performance to really serve other

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:45,770
users but the fact that you can do its

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:48,440
chemical all right thanks I'm going to

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,750
switch over here and grate it my Katie

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,470
will detect them all over again which

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:58,460
will of course work beautifully in a few

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,400
seconds yes it does all right as you can

00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:06,320
see here we have installed packets 178

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:12,740
out of 178 packages which is very nice

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:17,080
code up 3.0 release actually there has

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:19,730
been some RPM output mostly regarding

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,980
optional features of like MDB too so

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,650
don't get scared if you see that m2 v2

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,260
is a beach by database packets with a

00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,929
lot of plugins a lot of optionals you

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,540
don't need actually that much because

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:37,580
the actual driver like you can see here

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:40,280
is already installed all right according

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,440
to the manual and people who know me

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,730
will absolutely know that I always

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,300
follow manuals it says cold up dash

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,470
Pradesh set up alright since I've been

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:58,179
sold everything I'm just going to do

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,179
that and see what happens

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:06,320
actually seems to be doing something

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:11,320
first of all installing certificates on

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,450
a private server personally in a lot of

00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,170
Internet situations I have absolutely

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:21,400
not taken the effort of doing that but

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:24,740
actually the basic install of Kolob is

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,070
actually checking on that and also the

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,570
default setting is actually to have

00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,960
encrypted traffic between our components

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:37,070
so um do we want to run Cole absurd now

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,560
yes of course we do here we go supply a

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:44,600
passphrase I'm going to use the easily

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:49,010
rememberable roll-up one two three let's

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,840
see if it accepts that it does well as

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,790
you can see a private key is being

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,610
generated right now or at least I see a

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,940
lot of dots um it requests a country

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:00,580
name we're in Greece but I feel more

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,930
comfortable with my home country

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:10,990
netherlands haha state or province name

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:13,280
well let's go for my home site city

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,990
shameless plug for burr in the

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,820
Netherlands is very nice authentic

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,320
little place you should really go there

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:26,090
as nice seafood just like the saloniki

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:31,610
organizational name well let's also plug

00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:35,560
it there here we go organizational unit

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:39,200
name oh here my organization has units a

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,020
computer name or common name well let's

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,880
put mine in there since I'm pretty fond

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:49,760
of that email address not necessary so

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,390
here we go second p is being generated

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,620
and I should notice the information the

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,980
questions are pretty much

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:02,300
self-explanatory I'm pretty sure

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,930
everybody will find their way and to

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,930
renew passphrase

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,020
that's right again

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:27,220
and enter a new purse race apparently

00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:29,600
all right here we go again if your name

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,670
as you can see normally you have to do

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,080
all this crap manually with running

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,860
scripts and stuff so this is actually

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,860
pretty helpful

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:56,929
as you can see I'm already taking

00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:59,090
shortcuts I'm going to be really

00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:03,009
consistent in using this password which

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:05,929
will probably prevent me forgetting it

00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:08,509
all right now certificate has been

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:10,460
created and it's being signed for a

00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,989
default of one year it's actually good

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,700
to keep this in mind if you run your own

00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:15,259
server and start wondering after year

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,149
why nothing works anymore it might be

00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:22,999
because of the Civic tificate all right

00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:24,590
omit the thing actually it's now setting

00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:28,039
up a default configuration in postfix

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:31,070
very nice as well Cyrus is being updated

00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,940
with an access control list also being

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,489
updated with the certificates and

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,259
apparently it has decided that I did not

00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:41,330
configure the hostname right which I'm

00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:45,350
pretty sure I get but all right let's

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:47,919
run just to hear you can obviously see

00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,690
the sousa integration which is done by

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,820
community packaging because I water I'm

00:25:50,690 --> 00:26:00,769
guessing that sent OS would not run just

00:25:52,820 --> 00:26:03,230
to lump as you can see or at least as I

00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:05,600
can see it is showing some activity in

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,100
firing up cast oh it partly chose to do

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,100
the QT version why not

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:22,450
I need questions so far I mean seem to

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,130
be having time so no everybody thrilled

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,409
an enthusiastic that's the gist this is

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,320
working so nice good let's keep it that

00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:31,990
way maybe you have something to add in

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,179
between well yeah on the conceptual

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,429
level since we were there just before

00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,500
one of the very nice side effects of

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:41,200
storing everything in imap is that for

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,090
all the ACLS and sharing mechanisms you

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,289
can rely on the entire power of m of

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:50,230
acls it also means by the way that there

00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:52,570
is no de-escalation of privileges in the

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,159
web front-ends so anything that runs in

00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,990
the web server runs with the credentials

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,090
of the user that is now doing the

00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,429
operation which is obviously the only

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,990
session you can ever hijack so there is

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:03,850
no de-escalation there there is no

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,279
escalated privileges in the web server

00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:10,000
ever and we did that very much on

00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:11,799
purpose so relying on the ACLS of the

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,259
IMF service is in fact the strongest

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:18,460
choice you can make in our experience

00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:20,440
and being able to configure all the ACLS

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,740
on all the object types in the exact

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,830
same way is quite nice especially once

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,960
you combine it with ldap groups we set

00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,730
group acl's in the IMF server to say

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,009
someone who isn't that group has access

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,539
to that folder so once you move that

00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:38,860
person in and out of that group they

00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:42,009
gain or lose access so I'm macl so

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,590
extremely powerful of allow granularity

00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,299
all the way down to this person can

00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,480
write into that folder but they cannot

00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:51,100
read from that folder so even like one

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,950
way sharing operations where you can

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:57,730
drop data into a box where you don't

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,440
have access to it yourself later all

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,940
these kinds of scenarios are possible to

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,500
implement with that and they were

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,509
consistently over all data types thank

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,509
you welcome back as you can see there

00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:14,769
actually is a hostname in a domain name

00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:17,289
so I'm just going to click OK and wait

00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:20,139
for this to carry on all right now it's

00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,519
going to create an SQL database actually

00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:23,019
it's asking for the root password here

00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,279
just because of the configuration it's

00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:26,380
not going to store the root password

00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,700
anywhere

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,900
and to be quite sure I actually think I

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,040
did not set a root password for this

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:45,570
might as well instance yet so let's just

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:45,570
do that one bit and carry on then

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,080
this is perhaps a tricky bit of the

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,590
installation because i don't think that

00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:00,370
my SQL server is start it yet let's find

00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:05,050
that out actually this is also pretty

00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:10,510
much explanatory but if you do this

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:11,980
first time might be a bit daunting maybe

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,540
if you have anything to show in the

00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,790
meanwhile you can show while I set this

00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,710
up and then we carry out so I mean and I

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,610
have some screenshots here for those who

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:23,530
are curious how this actually looks um

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:31,780
let's do some eye candy done yes let's

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:35,770
have some eye candy so you see this is

00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:39,340
the web interface arm obviously so this

00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:42,270
is a run cube webmail if you if you've

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,720
seen the latest version very similar

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:49,390
just skinning job ultimately other than

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,960
that its stock what you get with

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:55,750
roundcube this is the compose dialogue

00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,850
you have the calendar this is one of the

00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,580
cool app components so you have a very

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:05,320
nice this is the month view you have a

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:07,750
day view and an agenda view as well so

00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,250
you have your standard view so the

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,920
calendar interface is a couple of very

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:16,360
nice tweaks such as you see a search box

00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,430
in the background there upper right I

00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,000
can enter any string in there and we'll

00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:25,210
do a search across all my calendar

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,340
events that it sees and then narrow down

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,340
what it displays in any of the views

00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,920
with that search string so if I say no

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,930
what oh I was looking for this how how

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,940
many events do I have with person X I

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,250
just type that name in there hit return

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,520
and suddenly I see only the events with

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:44,320
person X which is a very easy and

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,330
intuitive way to actually filter on the

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,540
display and you suddenly only see that

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:51,010
part then you know the whole thing of

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,160
event creation you see that there you

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:56,320
have obviously the the standard things

00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,890
you have a summary you have ability to

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,890
set alarms

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,090
that's actually wrong keep itself doing

00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,600
that I mean that are the web client

00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:12,280
itself doing that all of that is I mean

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,880
the web client for obvious reasons is a

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,190
live client it's not an offline client

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,929
so it directly works against the imap

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,670
server and the only thing that it does

00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:24,730
is use sequel for caching but that's

00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:31,650
about it otherwise it has no other store

00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:36,520
of that information you want to continue

00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:37,840
all right go for it all right cool I've

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:44,470
just said a root password pretty much

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:46,990
all server and started it up and of

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,750
course entering that with an interfering

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,570
dialogue is a recipe for success so I'm

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:56,830
gonna do that again all right here we go

00:31:52,570 --> 00:32:01,170
um it's now going to install postfix as

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:04,059
you can see it's also installing clam AV

00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,800
which is a very nice feature for those

00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:09,070
of you who try to integrate postfix with

00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:13,480
my maybe before this is also setting up

00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:15,160
automatically saves you a lot of time so

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,309
what is important to understand here is

00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,990
actually these are all components that

00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,460
are already in opensuse essentially

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,650
right except for you know a little bit

00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,940
of the colab demon you know the calendar

00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,650
interface and so on so forth but the

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,940
rest of it is already all there it's

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,100
just about pulling in the right

00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,070
components and configuring them and the

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,110
way in which Cole app has been set up in

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,240
particular since call up three is that

00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,350
every one of these individual components

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,910
retains their full option values so I

00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,410
mean what this is is essentially trying

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,910
to make it easy for someone who just

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,370
tries to get a single server up and

00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:50,920
running to run them through the steps

00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,230
but of course you can do all of this by

00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,910
hand including in distributed setups and

00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,940
so on and so forth and then we use

00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:59,679
puppet to under configure the systems

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,660
cobbler for for the system management

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,020
these kind of things so you can go as

00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,760
complex as you want I mean you can make

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,890
it very very complex if you want to

00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,500
however we try to make a simple

00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,180
community install possible so people can

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,190
just say you know I want call up set up

00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,570
it does everything for you you don't

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,010
really need to know a lot about the

00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,350
individual components that's exactly

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,000
what we're showing here and since all

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,150
the components are actually mostly the

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,130
vanilla components I upstream you can

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:30,010
also integrate it into an existing

00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,720
situation quite easy the installation

00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,760
script I'm following right now i have

00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,470
actually also used in an existing

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,530
installation with a running mail server

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:41,830
and not call up running on top of that

00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:44,860
and actually left it intact it just

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,780
added the options code up needed and it

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,150
did not disrupt anything else which is

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:52,270
by no means a guarantee for successful

00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,800
if any of you try this at home and the

00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,350
server crashed burned or eat your puppy

00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:00,100
that's not my fault but I managed to do

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:03,700
it so as you can see we're still

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,740
downloading some Clem AV stuff and

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,830
indeed this all actually come from the

00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,960
standard opensuse repository so and on

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,720
the vanilla aspect of it all there is

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,660
one one patch that is not required for

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,250
it to work but if you want a particular

00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,950
function you need it which is a patch

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:23,650
against PHP two advil research on a lab

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,780
because the roundcube address book is

00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,670
perhaps the most powerful l-dub address

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,100
book out there on the web client I

00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,380
haven't seen anything like it I mean vlv

00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:39,670
so paginate it you know virtual ListView

00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:46,150
searches on the entire thing and yes

00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:50,920
I've seen it and you you can actually

00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:53,290
use l-dub directories of hundreds of

00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,840
thousands of entries this way fast in

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,430
the web client which is nice that is a

00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,530
patch we are currently in the process of

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,910
up streaming with a PHP community but

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,710
you know you know how it is you develop

00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,810
something it takes a moment until it

00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,060
reaches the upstream that is the only

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,790
pageant is only required if you require

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:16,540
vlv other than that it's plain vanilla

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:19,810
all the way absolutely true for some

00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,250
reason clamavi is deciding to eat up a

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,720
lot of resources in rebuilding its

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,780
database so if you have somewhere I can

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,740
needn't feel free as a suit since we're

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,800
running out of time

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:34,930
let me just take a little bit of a speed

00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:38,619
tour here so since it's this is new in

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:42,730
3.1 this is the file interface in rank

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:45,520
you so all nicely integrated actually

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:50,080
you have dialogues and just see what I

00:35:45,520 --> 00:36:00,180
can bring one up for you like that need

00:35:50,080 --> 00:36:00,180
more hands yeah tip to tip one second oh

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:11,830
do we have I will just do this the fast

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,590
way this is the task module by the way

00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:16,390
which is largely GTD based so you just

00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,910
hack in a new task up there you can drag

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,910
and drop it to tag it to sort it and so

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:25,710
on and so forth synchronizes to the

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,710
iphone synchronizes to whatever you have

00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:33,900
this is the agenda view let me just see

00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm looking for one particular thing

00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:46,739
unfortunately I don't find it because

00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:48,869
what you have with 3.1 now is in the

00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:52,049
mail view you can actually do things

00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:53,999
like attached file from cloud save the

00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:55,259
attachments of this email into the cloud

00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:58,859
without them actually ever being

00:36:55,259 --> 00:37:02,039
downloaded so you can in fact do these

00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:04,289
things very nicely transparently with

00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,229
the dialogue and those dialogues from

00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,209
the file interface can be imported also

00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:13,609
into any other web application and the

00:37:09,209 --> 00:37:15,900
whole back end of the power module is

00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:18,299
written in a way that's very easy to

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,529
attach any sort of back end store so if

00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,329
you wanted to hook up your own cloud

00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:24,119
instance no problem if you want to hook

00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:26,189
up your samba4 share your whatever

00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,369
object store it doesn't really matter

00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:31,109
there's all sorts of ways in easily

00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,209
hooking it this up there's a clean API

00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:35,609
you just write a couple of calls and

00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:38,189
that store is integrated authentication

00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:41,699
through ldap is of course vastly

00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:44,640
preferred there but then that's about it

00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:47,999
you want to show okay all right I've

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,660
actually went through the code a brief

00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:54,179
setup phase actually five minutes left

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,509
so cool we have call up shut up here and

00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:59,189
I'm gonna nordy then you're actually the

00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:01,949
color pre set up is pretty much open to

00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:06,719
the specific here we are now entering

00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:09,239
that completely vanilla call up install

00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:13,589
I'm going to do the curl up one two

00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:15,539
three password again actually what we

00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:17,429
did before was actually setting up the

00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:21,630
infrastructure and now we're configuring

00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:23,369
the applications themselves this is a

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,709
lot of repetitive input as you can see

00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:28,289
we are administered or at least we are

00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:31,589
configuring the ldap administrator here

00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:37,079
and also the directory manager user all

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:40,140
right we need to use a system user as

00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,809
your previously explained everything is

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,509
run by its own user and also the login

00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,609
is done buddy I'm app user setup

00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:49,439
procedure plans to check for the

00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:52,249
following doing space this is actually

00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:55,109
very handy because it integrates in your

00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:57,969
actual domain

00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:59,979
pretty much you can simply follow the

00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:02,319
default here especially since this is a

00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:06,309
demo will not send mail I will simply

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,869
click on everything it's a shame we do

00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:11,109
not have a nice wizard which I can do

00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:12,789
next next next next next but still yep

00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:14,079
and the other thing that I wanted to

00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:19,089
highlight since we in a technical group

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:22,150
here yes we're almost done is that cool

00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:24,309
app the server side has an API based on

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,559
a Python come stack that is running on

00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:28,239
the server which gives you a command

00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,809
line to do administration of the server

00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,549
but it also exposes through the web

00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:36,130
adjacent based so restful if you're well

00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:38,619
interface to add a domain at a user

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,809
delete a user these kind of standard

00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:44,079
tasks so you didn't easily script this

00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:46,989
it is meant for a multi domain setup so

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,200
hosted scenarios if you will and then

00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:51,579
allows any sort of admin panel or admin

00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,609
interface that you have to easily

00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:56,349
integrate into that on the data level it

00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:57,999
is extremely easy to integrate into call

00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,979
up not just through cal def card ever

00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:04,239
and so on and so forth is perhaps even

00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:06,130
easier on some in some way to use the

00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,349
lib call a pin lip call up XML the call

00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,200
up XML writes the XML files as you can

00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:14,410
perhaps guess it is generated code so

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,009
it's from a schema description of the

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,719
actual standard it is generated and that

00:40:18,009 --> 00:40:23,109
allows us to generate it for any

00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:25,119
platform and it is then wrapped in the

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:27,430
lib call app which provides you with an

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,309
API to read and write colab objects

00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:32,319
natively and that is you know through

00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:35,559
multiple language bindings available

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,869
from C C++ Python PHP and so on and so

00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,539
forth so it's one stack that does this

00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:42,009
task that makes it extremely easy for

00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:44,739
you all you need is a lip call app and

00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:46,479
you need to have some form of em up

00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,369
library to do the home of handshakes and

00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:50,950
you have native call up integration into

00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:53,739
any application you want and then

00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,299
through the network you can access the

00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:57,819
calendar the address book whatever it's

00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:59,259
becomes extremely easy to integrate on a

00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:00,759
data level as well as on the

00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,349
administrative level through the Jason

00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:05,259
interface to make sure that you actually

00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:08,080
have easy ways to hook in the Jason

00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:11,500
interface is also what

00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,860
the web admin panel uses which is what

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:17,470
is coming up here now that one builds

00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,720
itself as purely modulite all it does is

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:22,120
through the API there is no secret sauce

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,070
here it's highly modular so you can

00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,950
actually extend this in any way that you

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:29,290
choose and it works again with the

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:33,520
credentials of whoever is actually in

00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:37,330
that you just here is some logged into

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,550
it and thus if you say don't have the

00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:42,550
permissions to add a certain thing then

00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:45,910
you don't get the option to do so so it

00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:48,250
it gets the the permission de-escalation

00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,470
again it's done on the back end so on

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:54,130
the the interface on the server itself

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:56,920
not in the web front-end so that's a

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:58,510
very important part of the way in which

00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,460
we design these things we don't trust

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,790
web technologies I mean they're nice and

00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:06,070
useful you want them but there's also

00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,460
always a way to break them so we don't

00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,990
trust them enough that we say you know

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,510
they should ever hold more information

00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:22,150
than they absolutely must do in order to

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:26,140
do that job properly all right and then

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:29,140
finally as my last point we don't exist

00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,210
just on the web we also have a desktop

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,520
client as I said I mean you can

00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:37,660
obviously hook up thunderbird and others

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,060
but we have one that we develop and let

00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:43,930
me just for the hell of it show it on

00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:46,930
windows which is some contacts k deepen

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,790
is it has been developed through and

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:54,010
from a bike whole app for a very long

00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:57,190
time and is obviously the KDE pim

00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,690
application again everything in the

00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:02,380
upstream everything with the upstream

00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,810
always as you can see it actually looks

00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:06,760
very native on windows i'm surprisingly

00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:09,130
native actually which is thanks to the

00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:13,960
power of QT which is the technology that

00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:17,110
powers it but yes so we have this client

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,250
on Windows we have it on Linux any

00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:22,170
distribution that you want virtually in

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:25,290
principal we can also bring it on to Mac

00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,790
but the most Mac users prefer to use the

00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,430
built-in applications which is why cal

00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:33,210
def car death were so important which

00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,410
we've just added with 3.1 release so if

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,480
there's big demand for it of course

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,340
we'll do it but right now most people

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,710
seem to prefer to go the native route

00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:43,170
there but yes so this gives you a full

00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:46,860
pimp sweet that is some able to go

00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:50,970
mano-a-mano with outlook and actually

00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,890
can replace it which is nice and it has

00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,800
multi server support always built in

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:58,080
full offline capability crypto

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,940
capabilities and so on and so forth so

00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:05,010
it has a a very very powerful set and

00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:09,380
following the rough start in the KDE 4

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,380
era it is now maturing very fast

00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,350
actually since we are running out of

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,540
time here I'm pretty much going to leave

00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:22,200
it at that actually what I just did was

00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:25,110
do the whole command line stuff what it

00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,110
results in is actually pretty much your

00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:29,700
basic installation without any user

00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:31,650
might anybody be interested in finishing

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,120
off this demo in a personal photo

00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,250
session perhaps because I'm more than

00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:41,240
willing to do that is their interest for

00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:44,400
that don't shout at all at once alright

00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm going to submit it as a Bob session

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,730
then and finish it up then because we

00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,010
are out of time apparently well I mean

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,140
this was initially two hour session so

00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,780
yeah get a bit squeezed we would have

00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,820
liked to go more into details but

00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,340
perhaps you've at least got in a quick

00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,810
overview or what call up is what the

00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,630
conceptual aspects are that make it

00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:09,510
interesting how you could actually get

00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:13,530
involved in fact the most important URL

00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:15,870
to remember it's get call a pork as well

00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:20,010
as did get collapses calm for some

00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:21,900
packaging repos and of course cool up

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,470
the dog as the website you'll find all

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,760
the information there and if you have

00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,500
other questions that's made in this

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,570
sensor and so forth we are still around

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,540
we'd be happy about anyone who wants to

00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:36,630
contribute in any way shape or form or

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:40,260
use it also if you have project that

00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:44,580
handles any form of pim data so address

00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,930
books calendars anything like it native

00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,180
integration on the data level would

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,160
actually be very interesting because we

00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,950
would like to hook this into as many

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,380
different projects as possible to make

00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,880
it easy for data exchange to happen

00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,160
because that is where the use of really

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,600
gains value any final words from you

00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,330
thank you very much for this opportunity

00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:09,200
and for your company producing the fine

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:13,350
software well thank you for being here

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,400
and yes we'll be around so in any case I

00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:17,190
hope it was at least a little bit

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,730
interesting I know it was a bit squished

00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:22,950
as a session but um I hope you'll

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,250
forgive me anyway all right thank you

00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,250
