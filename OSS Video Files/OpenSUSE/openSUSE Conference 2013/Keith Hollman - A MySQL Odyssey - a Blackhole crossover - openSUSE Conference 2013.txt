Description: 
	Replicating MySQL data cross-platform

MySQL in development environments are most widely deployed on a Windows platform: it's a natural step. However, the Sys Admin's & DBA's tend to prefer a Linux / Unix production host for resource growth capabilities and stability.
In addition to Disaster & Recovery solutions, MySQL Replication can be setup to help reduce the platform gap between the team's favourite solution, i.e. facilitate the platform crossover. For whatever need.

When using MySQL Replication we can share data models, data and even filter between environments and platforms. This can provide us with a wide range of possibilities, not just an automated D&R master-slave 'waiting for the worst to happen' and under-used environment. We can use each step to our own benefit and/or allow access and specific data access, that easily stretches the boundaries .. maximizing business benefits.

Here we'll be seeing a replication example setup, that replicates MySQL databases from a Windows Master, onto an Oracle Linux slave, whose tables are using the BLACKHOLE storage engine, in turn is a Master to the SLES environment.
