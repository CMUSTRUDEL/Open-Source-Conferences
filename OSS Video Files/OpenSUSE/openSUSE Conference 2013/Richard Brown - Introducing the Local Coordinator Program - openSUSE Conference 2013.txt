	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,690
process sorry you can hear me this

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,500
you're all here not on the video okay

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,509
yeah this is the combination of better

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,039
part of three years work from the

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,570
currently ambassadors team cost us yose

00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,090
people around the community to basically

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,150
look at where the Ambassador Program

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,789
worked where it didn't where we need to

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,470
make changes last year we did a

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,360
presentation at osc for ambassadors to

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,469
point o where the discussion was to

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,230
replace the entire bassett er program

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:43,410
instead the decisions been to add this

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,289
idea of local coordinators to basically

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,629
step in and I'll explain how and helped

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,850
organize the community better while

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,850
still keeping the ambassador's doing

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,670
their thing so why do we need to change

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,440
anything at all well if you are in a

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,359
berto session earlier today you should

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,489
have seen that the statistics show that

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,400
Oakland Suzy is growing we have more

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,220
contributors we have more users we have

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:13,140
more ambassadors we currently have 168

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,210
in been about 60 odd countries and and

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,890
also the type of contributors were

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,930
getting seemed to be getting more and

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,110
more diverse he sort of my opinion maybe

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,580
I'm really got any stats to prove it but

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,350
we have more coders but we also have

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,860
more artists and we used to have we have

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,409
more people involved in marketing and

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,780
this wider range of contributors is

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,180
making things more interesting for

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,430
organizing stuff especially it comes to

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,780
things like events and you can't just

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,759
assume that someone on the booths is

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,479
going to know everything about what's

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,460
going on in factory for example and not

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,159
only are we growing but we want to be

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,180
going even more and that means we eat to

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,180
be a little bit more organized

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,670
so it's bringing some challenges one of

00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,580
the things that on the board we've

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,010
definitely seen as an issue is is

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,899
actually getting feedback from the

00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,870
project to understand what's going on

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:15,200
especially in certain areas there's been

00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,060
plenty of times mauritius Asia etc where

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,410
we suddenly speak to someone at a

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,090
conference like this and we realized

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,520
that they've been doing stuff for years

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,410
that the rest of the project had no idea

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,230
about that it's really good stuff and

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,020
could be really helpful for the whole

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,400
community so we were hoping that the

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,800
local coordinators will give a much

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,300
easier communication route back to the

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,790
board back to the rest of the project so

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,370
we can understand what's going on that's

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:46,150
good and help when things aren't going

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:48,770
so good and also when it comes to

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,980
actually the project feeding back out to

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,630
these communities things change just

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,920
mean changes at Susan this changes in

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,380
the project we want to try new things

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,110
and getting that message out to the

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,870
community can be a very tricky thing we

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,540
have things like news opensuse jÃ¶rg we

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,070
have our forms but languages make things

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,700
complicated translation to make things

00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,430
ish it get in the way so we want to have

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,410
a route which we want the local

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,330
coordinators to be to feed this

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,880
information back to their local areas or

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,459
local regions so the entire project can

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,820
stay on one page understand what's going

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,820
on

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,239
and we need help organizing things

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,260
especially when it comes to things like

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:42,080
events in regions it's difficult and

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:46,050
getting more difficult to organize our

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,750
ambassadors to attend to show up we used

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,640
to have the Boosters at open Susie who

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,730
helped a great deal we no longer do it's

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,500
now a community thing and we want the

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,989
local coordinators to really step in and

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,819
help organize these events liaised with

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,080
Susie to help with the merchandising

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,030
which is going to talk about straight

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,530
after this and basically keep the word

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,120
spreading and also make it easier for

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,829
the ambassadors to have sort of one or

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,360
two people in their area they can speak

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:14,760
to as a sort of constant line of

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,639
communication rather than having to

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,169
speak to them rather than having to

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,209
always organize among themselves which

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,970
in certain areas like Greece like Brazil

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:29,040
where we have lots of ambassadors it can

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:32,700
get very complicated but what about our

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,990
ambassadors well despite last year's

00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,840
talking about replacing the entire

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,050
program we've decided to do nothing

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,590
apart from change the name we want to

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,110
call it open suse advocates because

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,880
ambassadors has certain connotations in

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,030
certain languages which make things a

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,229
bit more awkward or imply a certain

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,419
responsibility which I ambassadors don't

00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,930
have they're there to advertise and

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,830
advocate what's great about our project

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,130
so we might as well call them what

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,870
they're really doing and but about from

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,400
that everything's staying as it is we

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,410
want more ambassadors we want people

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,660
talking about open suse we want for

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:17,520
people using it so I thought I'd put

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,410
together a few examples of where I'm

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,690
hoping these local coordinators will be

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,840
able to step in and help him sort of

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,729
give some examples so like a new guy

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,020
someone new to the project new

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,440
contributor might have done a few things

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,180
in OBS or whatever but doesn't really

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,460
know their way around the project yet

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,760
hasn't really found the mailing lists

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,380
might not know about IRC but wants to

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,100
know more wants to start helping the

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,410
moment

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,540
it can be pretty hard for them to really

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,840
find where to get help so I we want to

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,660
have the local coordinators as nice easy

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,030
to find if you know if you need help

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,760
speak to this person hopefully in your

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,290
language and they will help you find

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,690
your way around the project know who to

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,340
talk to you know if you want to work on

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,380
gnome then go speak to the gnome guys

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,580
and you know just help the rooting

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,170
around and if the person if the

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,600
coordinator in question knows this stuff

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:16,580
as well then hopefully offer a bit of

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:26,850
mentoring in other words yes sorry go on

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:29,940
door yeah okay how do I prepare those

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,520
local coordinators to handle that by

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,430
selection we're not unlike in the past

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,290
where anyone could be an ambassador

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,450
we're making sure this time that local

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:42,690
coordinators have to be established

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,190
community members and we're as a simple

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,510
criteria at the moment times we're

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,280
saying they have to be an open suse

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,560
member because at least a membership

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,850
process that we have checks that you

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,950
know they've been doing a static

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,230
continue configuration tuition for a

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:58,800
little bit of time I'm hoping that's

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,360
going to be enough tied with the our

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,980
local coordinate is meeting up regularly

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,180
talking regoli on IRC and we're going to

00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,360
try and find a mailing list or something

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,700
there to help sort of keep that tied

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,320
together but yeah that's that's how

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,060
we're tackling that one kiss yeah that's

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,560
really important we don't want to fall

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,260
in the trap like we kind of did with the

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,020
ambassador's where the ambassador's

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,380
originally were meant to do this stuff

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,030
that was the original idea but by having

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,100
it so anyone could become an ambassador

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,120
they weren't prepared they didn't have

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,370
the skills they didn't have the

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,710
knowledge so that's sort of one of the

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,910
new things of these are established

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,910
community members who know this stuff

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,900
another example this is a real life

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,970
example josh is going to talk about in

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,800
the next session providing local

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,900
information in this case to Susie as a

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,880
sponsor you know Susie want to sponsor

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,280
events and they want to do their fancy

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,840
thing with their booth box and they want

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,510
to make sure our events have really good

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,190
supplies to run a decent booth

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,260
but they don't know which events in

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,890
which region are really important for

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,450
that region and the moment they're doing

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,190
their best and we've kind of put

00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,470
together a list and we think it's kind

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,060
of good but next year with the local

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,040
coordinators properly established we're

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,580
hoping that it'll be those coordinators

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,560
working with Susie to make that list

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,760
find which events are most important so

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,180
they know where to put their money and

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:24,330
hopefully we get better results better

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,730
marketing all that stuff out of it but

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,930
I'm saying Susie it could be any other

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:33,780
sponsor we might have if anyone's

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,250
interest and then yes actually

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,270
organizing open Susie's presents at

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,210
events this year in particular has been

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:44,850
really interesting things like Faust em

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,290
where I organized everything linux tag

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:52,580
where me and you're organized everything

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,810
it can be an awful lot of work but we

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,820
definitely need someone people to set up

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,850
with it because the open suse team no

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,210
longer are doing any of that but you

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,380
fair enough that their decision so we

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,470
want local coordinators to be able to

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,290
help organize with the organizers where

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,390
the booth is organized ambassadors to

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,370
turn up show they might not go

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,690
themselves there's been plenty of events

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,240
now that I've organized where I never

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,270
actually got to go I just organized it

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,160
everyone went it went out really well

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,360
but it and it really does help

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,590
especially with things like the travel

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,180
support program and everything else

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,400
having this single point of contact that

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,580
you can say this one person they're the

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,710
first to speak to and yeah so basically

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,940
take what we've learnt there and we

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:43,950
create it because I can't do everything

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:45,480
in Europe so yes these duties these are

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,820
these already on the wiki so if you've

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,060
already read it you just going to be

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,620
repeating myself I guess but yeah our

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,630
local coordinators are going to be the

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,100
go-to person or they go to people

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,720
because let's say in certain regions

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,500
like Brazil where we have other large

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,150
community we've got two volunteers we

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,650
decided that they'd work together we've

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,650
actually got to local coordinators there

00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:21,919
did I yeah so I've repeated that's right

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:24,559
already and the other thing we want our

00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:29,299
local coordinators to do let everyone

00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:31,369
know what's going on so blogs updating

00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,549
this stuff on the wiki helping write

00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:36,349
articles for news that opens easy to org

00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,649
it's really important that we know as a

00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,479
project what's going on because it

00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:43,669
doesn't just help you're part of that

00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:46,249
project a bigger it inspires others to

00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:48,529
help to get more involved you see what

00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,970
other people are doing and that kind of

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,349
sort of cross collaboration between the

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,399
different areas we're really hoping to

00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:58,189
sort of encouraged that phosphoric

00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,499
getting more involved and it worked with

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:01,579
grease it's working with mauritius we

00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,889
have a rather large community in

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,720
mauritius nail the sort of picked up the

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:10,879
banner there we want to see it grow into

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,989
other other regions as well but one

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,089
thing we're doing differently from the

00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:16,159
ambassador's if you're going to be a

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:20,329
local coordinator we need you to stay

00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,579
active and the moment it's going to be a

00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,929
board decision but over time this is

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,419
what we're going to change but if you

00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,039
don't remain active we are going to have

00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,839
to ask the ask / question in the same

00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:33,139
sorry you're not a local coordinator

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,220
anymore because if people aren't able to

00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:36,350
get in touch with you and you aren't

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,649
helping out with this there's no point

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,279
having your name listed on the website

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,649
because it's just going to make things

00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,019
awkward people so we'd rather have no

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:51,489
local coordinator for an area then have

00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:51,489
one that isn't doing their job go on

00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:00,750
who's going to check that and how at the

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:02,880
moment like i say the board in the

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,530
future we might be something like the

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,140
what was the ambassador welcome teams

00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,840
have a few organizers of the local

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,030
coordinators to help do that but at the

00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,860
moment it'll be a board thing so where

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,230
the board's been heavily involved in

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,320
putting this all together not just me as

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:23,790
a board member but the entire board how

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,250
yelling at people organizing speaking to

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,340
people talking to The Ambassadors

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:33,150
talking to the team sorting out as

00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,660
a board meeting yourself yeah so yeah so

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:42,090
we I'm intimately involved in this now I

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:47,430
intend to be in I can and yeah so I

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:49,560
should know what's going on now we want

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,450
our local coordinators to feel valued in

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,410
the project this is this is something

00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:57,780
that constants added we want to come up

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,680
with ways of really rewarding our local

00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,970
coordinator for doing this work because

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,700
we're asking a lot of them I mean this

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,780
isn't just like the where you know

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,520
you're coming in your pitching in you

00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,050
know we're going to be you're going to

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,590
be responsible for your region you're

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:13,350
going to be doing work for us so the

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,880
moment we can offer his reputation we're

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,740
going to put your details on the wiki

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,580
saying thank you very much an awful lot

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,320
and you know you can call yourself a

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,410
local coordinate and use that as your

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,510
advertising the project but we're

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,090
interested in the ideas of other ways of

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,510
sort of valuing and rewarding your

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:36,930
contributions one idea that came up with

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:38,730
credits on the distribution which I

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,120
don't know how we would do now but I

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:46,350
quite like the idea do you have any

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,760
ideas no but any other suggestions

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,760
please cuz I yeah

00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:02,580
yeah so yeah I'm just thinking you know

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:05,700
the right to identify it is cool but we

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,890
can actually i think for well so

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,440
expensive to send business cards think

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,940
it could be kind of nice also because

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,230
it's very useful at the conference

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,330
because if your local coordinator

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,630
exactly you can actually give people a

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,250
way to contact you okay yeah it's yeah

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,720
let's talk about that and let's get them

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:27,210
done I've got the designer already sir

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,880
yeah yeah no problem yep but it would

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:33,540
also probably be intelligent to use them

00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,990
as local storage right well yeah this

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,450
this ties with the the the merchandising

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,680
thing is is yes they all though as the

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,710
local contact they'll probably be the

00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,350
most relevant person to store that stuff

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,720
and young just to meet you and and

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,940
there's gonna be other examples like

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,190
that around the project where when we

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,230
need someone in a local area to help

00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,870
with that kind of stuff they're going to

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,430
be the first person to sorting and if

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,330
not be the person actually stores it

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:09,630
then at least know who can be trusted

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:11,040
that is a benefit yes yes okay I guess

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,890
if they're storing it they can be the

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,560
first person to Little League ecos

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:20,370
really into opensuse it's nice to have

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,300
dvds and everything at home yeah it

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,590
really it's no that's good good point so

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,940
I we had someone behind you with a

00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:32,610
question I would like to know if we have

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,390
the official wiki page I mean the wiki

00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,640
page worse than all we will create the

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,550
the wiki page of the local coordinate is

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,900
that that's done that's up now yes Oh

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:47,190
could you show me the page uh yeah I can

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,600
show you after that's correct i don't

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,820
want to change my presentation or now

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:56,130
but yeah yeah nope no problem thank you

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,930
did anyone else have any questions this

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:02,790
point

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,399
so currently we have 12 people and ah I

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,070
had the URL and yes made me take it off

00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,890
the slide that I did this all up it's

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,810
all your fault I'm blaming you oh yeah

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,640
but yeah these are our covent 12

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:18,300
coordinators who've volunteered and

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,940
stepped up so I part from alex is anyone

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,459
else on this list here don't think so

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:27,779
well yes now because I just put you on

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:29,610
the list 10 minutes ago but yes so we

00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:31,470
had in Brazil we have we have two

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,820
coordinators because Brazil is

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,520
particularly large and we had two

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,470
volunteers we decided it made sense but

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,510
normally we're only going to have one to

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,360
start off with and see how it goes from

00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,589
there we don't want to make this too big

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,149
I don't want to write this too

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,220
complicated there is only one of me at

00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,470
the moment so we're hoping to start

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,290
small see how it goes and grow as it

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,360
goes along so in the USA we have to

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:57,270
technically but one's going on the west

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,709
coast and ones on the east coast so we

00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,380
haven't quite drawn a line down the

00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:05,040
middle of the country yet but probably

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:08,880
well um but if you want to become one

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,480
yourself speak to me after this drop me

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,490
an email if you're an open Suzy member

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,559
I'm probably just going to say yes right

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,569
away if you're interested I want you to

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,689
be involved if you're not an open CZ

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,100
member i can tell you how to become one

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,449
and i'm actually on the Membership

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,000
Committee so I've been making sure that

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:32,190
I say yes or no cools quickly like a man

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,850
speed thing store if possible so any

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,850
questions

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:51,740
any comments no I'm just curious to know

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,630
if there are ready some documentation

00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:01,670
for Locker coordinators on what today or

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:04,220
for example how to the things that they

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:07,309
have to do okay yeah that's all on that

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,510
wiki page which I will yeah i'll give

00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:14,030
you the URL that's all on there right

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:16,730
now are there also like gold because

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:22,520
what you now said is like okay you

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:25,220
should do that yeah the the gullible the

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,590
goals are to help better organize our

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,100
presence I mean those specific goals for

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:36,950
a local coordinator like block once a

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:40,580
month or stuff like that mall yeah not

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,309
yet I quite like that idea block once

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,050
per month would probably be a good one

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:47,150
the other ones you know and but the

00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,770
other a lot of the other kind of target

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,690
areas that say for example like helping

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,480
with the events list that's going to be

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,760
like a one once a year kind of thing but

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,650
it's incredibly important depending on

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,700
your region there might be more events

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:03,920
and might be less events so yeah exactly

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,350
how I'd write those down i'm not sure

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,700
but i want to say at least one event to

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,160
the few in a region where we're doing

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,910
six seven events and we want to make

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:18,140
sure all six seven events are being

00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:21,679
attended by someone and so yeah I mean

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,990
I'm just a bit worried that this puts a

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,960
lot of you know investigation work on

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,960
the board or your next committee because

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,340
comedies tend to not to do anything yeah

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,679
no that's that's that's a really fair

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,059
point so yeah let's let's talk

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,280
afterwards and come up with some ideas

00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:44,480
and yeah I'll put them down collect

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,690
something we do need to look at anyone

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,690
else

00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:53,929
no good I was told I had to go quicker

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,929
