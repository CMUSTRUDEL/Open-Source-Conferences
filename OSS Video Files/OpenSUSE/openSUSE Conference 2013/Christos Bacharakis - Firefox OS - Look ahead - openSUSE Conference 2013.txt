Description: 
	Our motto is "the web is the platform" and our goal is to change the web for another time in history.
That's why we are presenting you Firefox OS the new mobile operating system brought to you by Firefox.
Built entirely using HTML5 and other open Web standards, Firefox OS is free from the rules and restrictions of existing proprietary platforms.
For the past 15 years, we've been instrumental in innovating and shaping the Web to keep it open and accessible to all. As a result of our efforts, one fifth of all Web activity today happens through Firefox products.
Our goal is to present you Firefox OS, Open Web Applications, Firefox Marketplace and how you could build your own open web app and contribute in the project helping us build a brighter future for the Web.
