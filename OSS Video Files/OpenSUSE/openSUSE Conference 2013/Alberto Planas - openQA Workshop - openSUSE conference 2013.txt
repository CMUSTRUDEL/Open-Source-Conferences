Title: Alberto Planas - openQA Workshop - openSUSE conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	openQA is an automatic testing tool that can be used to improve the quality of the distribution. With an automatic testing tool we can test different configurations in parallel, using small Perl scripts that drive the installation process, and assert the result using some image patterns algorithms. In this workshop we will learn how to create a new test from scratch and add it to the test repository.
