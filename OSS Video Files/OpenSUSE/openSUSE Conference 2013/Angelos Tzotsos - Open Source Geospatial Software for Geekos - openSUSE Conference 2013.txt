Title: Angelos Tzotsos - Open Source Geospatial Software for Geekos - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo, is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of open source geospatial software, and promote its widespread use. The foundation provides financial, organizational and legal support to the broader open source geospatial community. It also serves as an independent legal entity to which community members can contribute code, funding and other resources, secure in the knowledge that their contributions will be maintained for public benefit. OSGeo also serves as an outreach and advocacy organization for the open source geospatial community, and provides a common forum and shared infrastructure for improving cross-project collaboration.
This presentation will focus on the integration of OSGeo technologies with the openSUSE project, as well as the state, history, problems and motivation of the Application:Geo project on Open Build Service.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
software we are going to be introducing

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,069
the open source to a special foundation

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,400
at first and then we're going to talk

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,470
about the application geo repository in

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,480
open build service so let's start with

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,779
open source just passing Foundation

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,130
which is a non-profit rellapor open

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:29,849
source or special software and it it

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,309
also its specialized in education

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:36,719
projects and also concerned about open

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:39,210
data the open source responsible

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,190
foundation is a nonprofit organization

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,660
and the mission is to promote and help

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,649
development of open source geospatial

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,800
software around the world the foundation

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,699
is providing not all all not only

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,809
financial support but also legal and

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:04,350
legal support and infrastructures for

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:07,260
the several special communities the

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,119
foundation is is trying to make sure

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,600
that every project that is under the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,619
umbrella is and it's fully it freely

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,670
available in usable under an open source

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:23,189
license and currently seeking a non and

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:31,079
nonprofit legal status in the United

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:33,090
States so besides trying to provide

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,409
resources for open source or special

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,420
projects osseo is also trying to promote

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:44,850
open source software in the special

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,670
industry which is very very it it's it

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,619
maps are around the world right now and

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,670
everybody's using maps and everybody's

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,210
using geospatial data and one of those

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:01,710
goals is to promote also the widespread

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,259
use of open data and trying to bring in

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,119
to bring in quilting so special open

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,209
source projects and make sure that

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,290
though this quality is going to preserve

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,650
and the so it if the audio is going to

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,019
make

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,019
brand to support this kind of quality

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,200
also the OCIO is trying to encourage

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,689
communication between projects and

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,540
between several communities not only

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,810
between different programming languages

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,430
like Java C Python but also trying to

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,250
promote the software between several

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:44,340
operating systems we are operating an

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,299
annual conference which for this year is

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,450
going to be nottingham UK and all the

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:57,170
major projects of all geo as long as as

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,579
as well as many many companies and and

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:05,519
universities are going to be attending

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:08,310
there so oh there's some sort of an

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,180
organization that tries to incubate new

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,870
projects and make them official or do

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,840
projects for in order to make sure that

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,629
they are working as expected and there

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,650
are several bodies that are working

00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:29,669
under the ogio umbrella in order to make

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,829
to make the goals be feasible so we have

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:35,180
board of directors which are elected

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:37,379
from charter members charter members are

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,459
contributors to open source projects

00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:45,120
that are well respected or they're

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:50,609
recognized amongst the community also we

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:53,659
have members who are all the users all

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:57,150
the community and we're trying to

00:03:53,659 --> 00:04:00,419
support local chapters so in every

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,280
country or in every region we have local

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,549
communities that are developed and

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,239
working together for open source just

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,669
Pascal software now another chapter that

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,289
I want to introduce is the LDC Odyssey

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:20,130
is stands for open geospatial consortium

00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:23,719
which is the equivalent of w3c four just

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,540
pasyal so it's an organization that

00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:29,910
includes 478 companies

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,150
government agencies and universities all

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,320
participating and trying to make

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,080
standards and standards are very

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,570
important in just bass real world too

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,020
especially when we have different types

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:50,090
of data that need to be presented into

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:54,600
the same map and interoperable way so

00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,220
the standards promote the technology and

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,200
the developers are making sure that

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,960
conflicts your special data are going to

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,100
be accessible and useful with all kinds

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,530
of software and applications also this

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,950
is a good way of making your application

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:14,370
future proof so meaning if you are if

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,380
you are implementing an LG c standard

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,790
then in the future you know that this is

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,580
going to be supported and that you're

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:26,670
not going to have your data just not

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:29,400
usable by future projects so as in open

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:33,180
source just as in open source in general

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:36,090
we have been doing well in the last

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:41,130
couple of years or maybe the last decade

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:46,290
so those possible applications are doing

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:49,440
very well especially on the web you can

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,680
find maps almost in many applications

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,320
that you use everyday and on the web

00:05:51,680 --> 00:06:02,880
apart from the from the commercial ones

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:05,760
and this is reflected in major portals

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,360
and the national spatial data

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,960
infrastructure around the world but as

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,600
with all open source we are still not

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,540
doing very well on desktop where we have

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,890
commercial applications still having the

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,930
market share but also we have been

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:30,180
introducing some new projects in the

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,640
mobile area too so what what what are

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,830
the big wins for open soldiers Pascal we

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,540
have two major wins first of all we have

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,780
the inspired directive which is a

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,610
directive of the European Union trying

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,139
to ensure that the special data

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,050
infrastructures are going to be

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,319
compatible and this is done using the

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,139
open standards from OCC and the

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,639
community supporting it so what has

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,930
happened in the European Union is that

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,449
the member the member states are

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,460
encouraged to use free and open source

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:10,409
software implement those standards and

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:13,590
so we have the inspired job portal which

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:17,099
is which is developed in open source

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,400
software and it developed using two

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:22,979
major major projects of both deal with

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,779
our degree and often layers as you can

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,669
see a screenshot here this is I don't

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:31,949
know if you have seen this interface

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:36,080
before but this is very common in web

00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:40,379
pages nowadays besides other well-known

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,629
map frameworks so what happened next

00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:47,129
after Europe embracing the open-source

00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:50,190
just possible applications for the web

00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:54,379
then we had many open that that data

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:59,819
portals also using the same technologies

00:07:54,379 --> 00:08:04,020
in order to to promote and use spatial

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:08,069
data on the web and currently the the

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,439
American data.gov website has moved to

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:14,849
an open source project which is the

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:18,569
second framework and right now the

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:22,979
biggest data catalog in the world with

00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:25,319
around 500,000 data sets is maintained

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,879
purely on open source response and

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,699
software so we are doing good in just

00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:37,579
partial world and we are just keeping to

00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:41,279
trying to keep up with new opportunities

00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:43,440
so I'm going to give you an overview of

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,790
the project categories that we have and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,500
this does not only include osteo

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,380
vacations but also other applications

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,820
that are affiliated or are trying to get

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,190
into incubation 40

00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,910
first of all we have special special

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,000
databases the most commonly commonly

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:11,260
used used and known as passe gies which

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,750
is an extension to postgresql so this

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,910
introduces a number of functions that

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:21,370
are doing spatial special functions that

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,830
you can work with and you can do spatial

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:27,760
queries and you add location to your

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:31,350
database so it introduces some new data

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,820
types of the geometry type in order to

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,270
make all this spatial information

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,360
available next we have special light

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:44,010
which is a SQLite extension which also

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:50,740
is being used to represent and store

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:53,550
spatial data the next category's around

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,140
web services and since we have many

00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:05,050
Odyssey standards on that area we have a

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:07,330
great great list of software's around

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,450
here most of them are about displaying

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,090
maps through the web others are about

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,510
making catalogs and search engines about

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:19,990
where to find your data where where what

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:22,480
what kind of places are around me what

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,130
how can I found find something related

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,480
to special special content so the most

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:34,810
the oldest one of those is mapserver

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,320
more than 15 years old which is a

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,580
project that brought maps to the to the

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,610
web through CGI which is really old way

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:48,970
of doing things but it was the pioneer

00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:53,700
in that area more recent software's are

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:57,310
geoserver which is developed since 2001

00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:00,960
where somebody can just add data into

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,490
the server and then make sure that this

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,310
throw em up and then serve it to the

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:11,200
users and include it into a website

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:14,680
there are other categories in the server

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,860
like proxy software processing software

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,110
that you can use the naval because the

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,960
data the data that you are providing to

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:28,030
the web and making sure it runs smoothly

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,370
and faster recently we have some web

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,500
processing services which means that we

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,660
are moving the data processing to the

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,110
cloud and now we can access and

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,420
manipulate our data and edit and do cool

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,680
stuff with it through the web and not

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:48,910
only through a desktop application also

00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:53,520
we have metadata catalogs which is the

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:58,030
search engines that are used for

00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,820
discovering data and finding where you

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,870
can download data from especially for

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:09,850
open data so the next category goes to

00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:13,090
the client is for web mapping that is is

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:16,180
working on your browser and the most

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,490
known projects for that the two first

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,900
the openlayers project and the leaflet

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,160
project are used to integrate our

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,830
JavaScript libraries to integrate maps

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,960
into your application this is the the

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:34,030
most well you well known and used

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,000
openlayers java javascript library and

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:41,290
leaflet in case you you've seen the

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,450
conference map it's using leaflet and I

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,270
had nothing to do with it they just use

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,930
it they didn't ask me so this is a

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:52,570
rather new new JavaScript library which

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,780
is very lightweight and can be easily

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,610
deployed but then we have social media

00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,460
that are you are now trying to

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,340
incorporate maps and one project that is

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:06,850
very interesting is to your note and

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:09,730
these projects trying to make users try

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:14,050
to share the their data in a way similar

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:17,140
to a social network so this is a new

00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:20,260
product that can everybody can deploy on

00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,350
their server and cold users to share

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,650
their data and their map

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:29,740
and also we have extension for very

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,590
well-known projects like drupal and we

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,690
have this this project called cartero

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,490
here which is an add-on to Drupal and

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,740
you can just take any Drupal

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:44,470
installation you have and add maps to it

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:49,150
and just do cool stuff with your data

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:53,770
through CMS platform then we move to

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:58,770
desktop applications when we have the

00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:04,420
most success the most the oldest of the

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:09,040
software grass GIS was started 30 years

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:14,740
ago this is before new project even

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,730
started and this is a fool who fled GIS

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:22,270
you can edit your data you can do

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:25,450
special analyses you can add satellite

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,660
data and make all the kind of processing

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:37,540
in order to come to to accomplish a new

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:40,780
map more recently to GIS is a full GIS

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:49,210
platform that is developed on top of

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:51,430
cute and this has lots of lots of lots

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:56,260
of features that can be used again to

00:14:51,430 --> 00:15:02,140
create maps or to make special analysis

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:05,020
of different kinds then we have projects

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,930
that are more specific to your need for

00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:11,290
example we have mock neck map nick is a

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:14,580
rendering engine that is used to draw

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:18,790
the maps of openstreetmap I think you'll

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:21,850
most of you have seen openstreetmap and

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,700
the free maps are available through the

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:29,260
web and the rest of the rendering engine

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,930
is maddening and let's move on because i

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,070
have so many projects i cannot focus

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:39,370
through which one of them so we have

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:43,960
another category which is navigation and

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:47,620
maps here we have some open Street

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,890
street maps editor's which can be used

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:54,070
in order to simple users contribute

00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,140
their their data to the OpenStreetMap

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,960
projects so you can actually download

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,260
this software and then go to your area

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,930
and create maps for your for your area

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:09,010
or you can just add your street name in

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:11,140
there you can add than the numbering of

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:15,370
streets in your area and contribute back

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:18,580
to the OpenStreetMap project that we

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,160
have a project that is part of KD today

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,250
and you can find it in every openSUSE

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,310
installation which is marble and there

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,860
is a there's a presentation tomorrow

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:33,310
about this I'm not going boil the

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:35,920
presentation and talk much about it this

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,260
is a virtual globe with many many many

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:44,610
applications many many features you can

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:47,110
in just I will not say any more profit

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,230
we have a different very special

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,490
category for crisis management where we

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,910
have two platforms or web platforms that

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:03,220
were used in the past during natural

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:06,420
disasters those two platforms are were

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:11,140
used in cases of emergency in order to

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,720
bring fast data to the to the to the

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,209
civilians when needed for example when

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,980
the nest quake or flood takes place in

00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:24,040
easily going and say where you need when

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,439
you can find help so these are platforms

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,140
that are used in cases of emergency and

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,160
have been deployed successful in the

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:36,190
past and have saved lives actually the

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,860
final categories for the developers we

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,200
have several special libraries that are

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,780
used in order to develop the previous

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,630
applications that have shown and much

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,020
more libraries

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,900
are included I'm going to tell you later

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:56,250
which of those applications are

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:58,950
available in opensuse for example the

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,160
doll which is one of the most successful

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:05,280
ones actually you can just take any kind

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,250
of data in any format and transforming

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,170
transform editor into another format so

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:15,750
it's like something like the swiss knife

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:18,140
of your special for us now audio is

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,120
making a demo DVD which is a

00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,950
distribution that can be all of those

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,440
projects that i have mentioned and much

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,730
more can be just tested through those

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,120
you live distribution but now i'm going

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:37,860
to move along with the application geo

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:41,100
repository so what is the open view the

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:44,550
the applications real repository it's a

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:49,380
build service project actually but it

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:52,290
has been around way long before the open

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:56,690
build service was created actually when

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:59,850
i started using opensuse back in 1998

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,400
there were already many many RPM

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,760
packages available for opensuse that

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,270
were not seen in other distributions so

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,680
for all the cas specialists and

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:17,460
professionals opensuse was the main the

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:22,820
main platform for doing for doing GS

00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:27,450
work so this data repository is

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:30,030
including any GIS relay it includes GIS

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,700
related programs data sets and

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,730
everything else related we have software

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,880
for GPS so that you can use your GPS

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,680
through your openSUSE installation we

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,390
have software about mapping and how to

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,100
handle maps and display maps and

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:50,550
everything else that feeds into this

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:56,280
category it includes 132 projects today

00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:58,250
as we speak and as I said it's one of

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:03,140
the oldest and well known

00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:06,210
repositories and when OBS was introduced

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:09,269
this was a great boost for for the way

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,429
we were building our packages and this

00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:14,909
enabled us to have more contributions

00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:18,659
this enabled us to attract developers

00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:21,090
that wanted their packets to be to be

00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:24,419
created not only for opensuse but also

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,940
for other RPM distributions and it was

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:32,269
really really a great a great boost to

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:35,279
keeping updates working for everybody so

00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:38,250
where we are doing well we're doing well

00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:40,440
very well because all major stable

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,330
releases of the software are really

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,260
package within hours and when I mean

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,480
hours I mean okay not two hours but

00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,000
after a software gets out and it says

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,590
okay we have a new release within a day

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,779
or two you're going to find it in

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,710
application jail and this is something

00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:00,330
that is not done in other distributions

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,120
so we're trying to keep up the quality

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:06,149
of the distribution and what GIS

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,870
specialist expect from opensuse and I

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:13,950
think we are doing well so far we have

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:16,380
many cases where new stable versions are

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,960
available week before other packages it

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,460
kept packaging systems and I have some

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,529
examples here and we also have some new

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,830
projects that are missing from other

00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:31,289
distributions and other other operating

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,789
systems for example we have web

00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,220
processing service that can be deployed

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:40,110
within minutes from an RPM from

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:43,529
plication 0 repository and many many of

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,870
the projects that i already mentioned so

00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:48,870
what's the status today lots of green we

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:51,539
have few errors we have things that

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,399
don't break often unless something

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,549
really major happens to factory or

00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:58,950
something like that but in general as

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,789
you can see it's mostly green so we are

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,200
in a good shape but we have to probe

00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,519
some problems and the main problems are

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,969
Java packaging this is

00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:15,299
a very sad story because most open

00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:18,539
source geospatial software that uses

00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:21,450
Java has been as the being developed in

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:25,049
Java are using maven so we have

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:28,999
difficulties in including and building

00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:32,940
code that when we don't we have to be

00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:35,940
based on on maven and that's a big

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,969
packaging issue for us right now which I

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:44,219
hope we can solve for Jenny more Java

00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:46,829
experts helping us we have a lack of

00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:49,579
staging probe project which means that

00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:51,869
we currently do not have a testing

00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:54,809
repository in order to get better

00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:56,820
versions and release candidates in so we

00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:00,059
need that tool in order to make sure

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:04,200
that we have more bleeding edge packages

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,389
and okay things are doing pretty well

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,559
for opensuse but what abouts less and

00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:11,849
santos and red hat and other RPM based

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:15,479
packages those are not very well

00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:18,690
maintained to be honest so we need more

00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:23,129
manpower in there to make sure that

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:27,209
those are also supported and something

00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:29,519
that has been discussed today outside in

00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:32,009
the conference that we have not

00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,479
contributed very much to factory which

00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:40,169
is really something that we should make

00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:42,450
we should try to make it more we suggest

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,859
contribute motor factors also that we

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,809
can get more packages in the

00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:51,749
distribution itself so this is spring

00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:53,789
sort of what happens when we when we see

00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:57,959
what what's going on with Santos and red

00:23:53,789 --> 00:24:01,589
hat and slap so as you can see we have

00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:04,379
problems here some dependencies are

00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:09,149
missing some libraries are incompatible

00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:13,289
from previous versions so this needs

00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:17,249
some work so watching it for the future

00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:21,990
we wish to add more web platforms right

00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:25,340
now application geo is mostly including

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:30,090
desktop application they're developing

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:33,960
libraries but some of the well-known

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,559
projects that are webbed oriented are

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:41,910
missing so we are trying now to include

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:44,309
0 node C can do server and projects that

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,059
have have been really using the

00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:50,040
enterprise today and we're trying to use

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,610
them as well and create packages for

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,580
them too and we have a dream of creating

00:24:53,610 --> 00:25:00,020
new nastya live flavor based on opensuse

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,240
but that's something for the future

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,750
thank you very much how we have any

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,750
questions

00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,979
to say to have no staging project is

00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:25,129
there anything but you stopped just to

00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:27,830
create one or sorry can you say that you

00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:30,049
had you lack and staging project for the

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,109
beta versions mm-hmm is there anything

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:35,149
what you stops to create just one no no

00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:37,009
it's just we need time and we need more

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,859
time to do it it's not that we have any

00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:44,929
problems implementing that we just need

00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:54,820
to organize more it's just that it's

00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:54,820
just a suggestion so any other questions

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,590
