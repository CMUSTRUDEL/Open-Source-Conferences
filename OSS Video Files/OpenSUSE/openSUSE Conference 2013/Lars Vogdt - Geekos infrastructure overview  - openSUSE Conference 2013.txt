good morning ladies and gentlemen oh

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:15,540
nice we will train this over the day in

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,390
the end will say caliber ah ok I'm not

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,470
 I'm the team leader of the

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:24,689
services team inside suzhou and part of

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,740
my job is also to drive some of the

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,250
infrastructure behind opensuse and I'd

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:37,980
like to give you an overview today about

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:42,390
whom we are what we have what we do what

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,250
we do not and maybe in the end have a

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,250
short discussion if you have questions

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,289
or so I already covered hopefully some

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,090
questions that I got during the last

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:56,390
days and yeah if that does not help

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,920
because i have just half an hour I

00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,539
scheduled a buff at 1500 so in that case

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,680
we will just move the discussion over

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:14,070
there and follow up there ok first as

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,500
all of us want to know what's behind the

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:25,470
infrastructure here are some hidden

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:32,390
pictures miss her arm farm or X the next

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:38,549
arm build hosts storage the cloud wreck

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:41,759
something I even cannot remember and

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:46,409
yeah that's the opensuse infrastructure

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,430
I want to talk about today so those are

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:54,030
all the machines but the question is who

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,200
we are and i have brought with me some

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,560
pictures of course we always have box

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,000
that's why he is there but we also have

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,640
some nice guys like Thomas Schmidt

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,420
working all days fixing open fate or

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,560
features dot opensuse orc especially the

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,730
database crashing

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:24,060
much often today mr. v bar working in

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:28,940
Provo Utah use a running some parts of

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,819
the infrastructure michael martin shy

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,470
sitting in park driving from this

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,780
location some parts of the

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,220
infrastructure helping with mirroring

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,350
matthew ela also sitting in provo i

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:51,269
guess some of you might know this guy

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:54,720
already henna more or less firefighter

00:02:51,269 --> 00:03:00,030
but mainly the man behind lists opensuse

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:06,019
org some guy I'm happy to have this

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,019
picture found in the web thanks Jurgen

00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,989
so this is when he started informed eyes

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,959
he's more crazy sitting in front of the

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,170
computer but you have to see him when he

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,790
does this okay I guess most of you

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:26,310
already know culo currently working on

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,790
the build service a lot especially the

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,380
RP and the web UI and most of the time

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,170
bring the build service down I don't

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,180
know if it's this paid task or if you

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:43,049
doing it just for fun but then Oh yellow

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,440
key paske blazer of course currently not

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,720
here but I mentioned him because he's

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,519
one of the craziest guys setting up most

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,970
of the crazy stuff that no we have to

00:03:50,519 --> 00:04:02,579
maintain vonage sitting here thanks

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:04,530
driving open QA ah Christopher currently

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,549
not available I guess that's the first

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,319
conference he missed doing hamis so if

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,840
you get some emails from the build

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,970
service he's the one who normally is

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,220
responsible for it and the master of

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:23,880
disaster Derek's or as most of them call

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,669
him mr. universe mr. i know everything

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,810
and for me the best one I can fix

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,610
everything

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,500
so if you ever have questions about the

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,020
service you don't know how to restart it

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,789
or so he's the one you normally want to

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:43,300
ask because he is able to fix it and

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:44,949
yeah we have many many more people but

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,820
those are the ones where I get pictures

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:52,539
from so that's why it's currently

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,330
limited but i want to show you where you

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:57,550
can find more information it's on the

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,800
wiki already so there's a services team

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,490
wiki page where you can find normally my

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,949
team there is also a build service team

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,449
wiki page where you can find most of

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,849
that guy is currently driving the build

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,110
service and most of the time when the

00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:14,680
servers are down they are coming to us

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,289
or to me but they are responsible for

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,110
the software part more or less but as

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:23,259
least adrian is also helping a lot in

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,930
terms of fixing hardware and restarting

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:31,710
all the service again and again and we

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:35,409
have a lot of community members so I

00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,659
hope you will find some of those

00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:40,780
nicknames useful when you're in a

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:45,430
channel so now you know that those maybe

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:49,780
can also help you in the end it's around

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:52,570
13 people inside Souza and please be

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,449
aware that this list of 13 people inside

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,630
zuzu does not mean that they are working

00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,229
full time on the administration that is

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,349
just that they help from time to time if

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,120
I ask them and most of the time they

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,880
just fix the service and then go back to

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,729
the normal work and we are 10 external

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,240
people already helping us to maintain

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:18,759
the services and provide you with all

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,849
that what you need normally so we are 23

00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,419
people at all and if you say okay it's

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:27,759
just one hour that everyone spends of

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:32,229
the year we are reaching a limit of

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,330
roundly 5,000 hours per year working

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,270
just for the infrastructure just to

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,700
provide you with the needed services so

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,230
it's always a lot and the sad story is

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,180
it's decreasing

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:50,230
because more and more people have less

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:53,310
time okay so we saw already some

00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:58,330
pictures now I'll give you some numbers

00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:02,320
now I'm back our headquarter of Susie we

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:06,180
have 25 real machines somewhat around 20

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,470
virtual machines the mount is slightly

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,660
decreasing and increasing over the time

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,500
depending on how many developers like to

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,700
have one we have around 45 or you'll

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,110
build workers if they are all online

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,370
we're not crashing because of dying hard

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:28,630
disks seven switches different VLANs a

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,790
lot of fun with cabling serial console

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,300
server k vm server so people can

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:38,650
remotely log in to fix the machine more

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:41,710
or less even if it's down there in

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,050
different storages luckily user provides

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:48,850
us some storage at the moment we are at

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,620
28 terabyte and the interesting part is

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,290
this one is the only one that always

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,800
just increases I never showed shrinking

00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,080
but ok let's see how far we are in a few

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,960
years with the success of the build

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,500
service but we also have provo improve

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,030
data center where Matthew and Scott are

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,390
driving all those things and they have a

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,820
cluster of three machines driving the

00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:17,190
forums wiki's and WordPress instances

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:22,150
and of course they have another database

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:25,270
cluster including the storage so provo

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,940
is currently mainly for all the wiki

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,220
pages for the forum for lizard news and

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,560
also driving back Silla opens with awk

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,510
which is back still another come at the

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,370
moment and we have known back very run

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,240
all the other services that are not

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:46,300
hosted improving so everything else

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,740
which is not kind of forum or some kind

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,730
of word present stands is normally

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:59,110
located in Nome back ok

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:03,910
something more yes we have it we can we

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:06,580
have of course mirror brain how many are

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,120
aware of it but neuro brain was

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,720
developed in house and we still use it

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,730
in our times now sourceforge is using it

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,880
libreoffice it using it and more and

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,280
more companies having download

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,290
redirection problems i say in that way

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,290
or just want to save some money at

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,260
jumping on that boat and driving mirror

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:32,530
brain so it's a interesting success

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,330
story for infrastructure guys not so

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:38,680
visible outside because people just use

00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,330
it never know what it is we have the

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,430
build servers of course i guess many of

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:47,380
you know him building a lot of packages

00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:49,930
building a lot of effort for us so to

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,480
fix all the machines help people fix

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:55,420
sometimes also the packages thanks to

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,630
derek's and we have a virtualization

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:03,430
platform which started right right way

00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,500
before somebody announces the cloud so i

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,710
cannot name it the cloud we always say

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,080
that aliceinwonderland because the first

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,510
server that was running this

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,860
virtualization platform was called Ellis

00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,100
so that's why it's called Alice in

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:22,030
Wonderland and what we planned currently

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,580
is to migrate to the cloud once the two

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:27,760
that are is Elise is finished so there

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,860
will be some changes but currently I

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,060
don't expect much interruptions of the

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,430
services same yeah and probably some of

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,120
you might already asked what else do we

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,790
have yes we have some services we have

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,030
forums connect album q a harmless news

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,760
active dog and so on and so on yes I

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:53,200
just want to mention some here and yeah

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:57,400
way more so if you count all those

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,660
services it would be very interesting I

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:04,810
even lost the overview there so having a

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,900
view on the DNS servers just getting all

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:10,120
the names back you

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,410
I'd have a slide idea about how many

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,740
services are really running behind

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:17,080
opensuse and the bad part is that most

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,870
people even don't know most of those

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,120
services that are available so we should

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,550
point people hey have a look at legal

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,620
opensuse or aquarius good what's this

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:33,270
same thing happens for active dark for

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,890
example where you can write on your

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,990
documentation for opensuse and so on and

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,820
so on most people don't know it and

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:43,090
hopefully we can change this over the

00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,460
time this presentation is hopefully too

00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:52,450
short to give a whole overview about

00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:54,520
this story okay so I told you I already

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,290
what are our goals inside the

00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,020
infrastructure team for the new future

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:04,780
of course number one promote ourselves I

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,460
guess it's a good idea increase the

00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,100
communication with the community that's

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,740
why I'm here for increase the awareness

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,320
inside this used to be you thanks to

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,610
Ralph we're working on it implement

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,690
rules and guidelines for our

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,680
infrastructure I guess you've seen the

00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:26,920
talk from Jaws in former times we didn't

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,530
even have some rules or guidelines for

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,000
our infrastructure and we will change

00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:39,120
this right now today during this talk i

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,300
will show you later and yes if time and

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,370
money permits refresh our hardware base

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:51,000
so we don't have many failures in the

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:56,790
future but as always the question is how

00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,460
so let's go through it better promotion

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:06,550
the current idea is to get direct

00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:09,160
contact to the marketing guys so expect

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:12,640
some crazy article requests from us in

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,120
the future and probably you need to help

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:20,230
us with the English and get some

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,850
pictures online we are starting and have

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,009
started already writing blog

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,810
entries about our work and what we do so

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,180
if you visit the wiki pages i mentioned

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:31,420
before you will see that there are links

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:35,019
already redirecting to different blocks

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:38,319
which are available yes we know we might

00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,870
include them into planet opensuse org i

00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:45,339
guess most of them are already if not

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:48,100
just ping us and we will do it and give

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,440
talks like this one as a starting point

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,050
we just need to find a talk master

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,360
because you know normally guys like me

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,120
and normally sitting in dark dark carer

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,019
somewhere our conditions cooled down to

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,940
10 degrees so I can work that's probably

00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,319
not what you want so we need to find

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:10,540
someone who does it and yeah that's it

00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,639
for the goal number one we started today

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,050
you will see how we do it in the near

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:21,459
future yes but I helped us before we do

00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:24,480
it on our own might be interesting okay

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:27,939
goal number to increase communication

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,339
currently admin opensuse arc which is

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:34,149
our main contact address for all of you

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:37,899
is just a mailing list and that's why

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:40,029
sometimes requests are getting lost we

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:43,420
have a rule and not written down rule

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:48,069
that every email coming in that is not

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:50,860
answered is an open ticket but as always

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:53,680
people went on vacation people getting

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,380
sick and normally this guy who normally

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,689
acts on all those mails for for example

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,480
the mirror stuff or the ERG cloaks is

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:04,980
not available and suddenly all others

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,600
sit down and said okay he will handle it

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,720
but if he is not available we just get

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,240
lost of it bad story so we decided we

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,490
will have a public ticket system so even

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,350
those guys who have a login at opensuse

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,259
or can log in and see and maybe even

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:24,250
work on tickets if the lag or at least

00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:27,339
file new tickets yes he better promote

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,980
admin opensuse org ftp and so on this

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,540
other males where you can reach us

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,630
normally they're just pointing to one

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,440
address but just to give people the

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,970
impression that we

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:43,320
always available we are always available

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,790
in our channel at least tarick's is and

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,880
we will change this over the time we

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,850
have our own work channel now which is

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,000
open to the admin so if there is a

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,220
problem just join in tell us and we were

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,320
react hopefully we're currently working

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,810
on a bot which needs to start up there

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,220
so we can even have a backlog tracking

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,080
and yes we are currently thinking about

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,680
consolidation days or hours so others

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:14,260
have the box crashing parties so I guess

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,620
it's time to think about getting some

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,390
tutorship introducing new people get

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,240
them on board show them how we do it

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,030
train them and afterwards leave them

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,840
alone with all the problems as we always

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:37,060
do okay next goal increase awareness yes

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:39,820
working on it rules and guidelines as I

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,880
mentioned those infrastructure mentors

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,810
will become more important in the next

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,030
month's so every when someone wants to

00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,070
start a new service or just join in we

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:55,360
will give him some tutor at hand so he

00:16:51,070 --> 00:17:00,120
can relax slow down and learn as fast as

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,530
he wants and of course stay and check

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,530
the new open to the infrastructure

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:11,770
policy which is online now in the

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:15,390
opensuse Vicky oh sorry and I missed the

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,910
URL if you go on en opensuse org

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:24,480
infrastructure underscore policy there

00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:27,370
it is but of course I will just show you

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,220
what our infrastructure policy is in

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:33,670
short term we had a discussion with the

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,640
board looked out with it and so I just

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:40,690
give you a summary we came and said ok

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,380
users expect us to be reachable all the

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:47,130
time services to be up all the time and

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,690
of course everything has to be secured

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:55,509
and everything has always to be

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:57,820
up to date the question is how okay so

00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:00,879
we said in short word you should at

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,730
least have someone available someone who

00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:07,360
can act or react and even if it's just

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,610
hey yes thanks for the information I now

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,620
start to find someone who can really fix

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:16,929
it so people are welcomed and say okay

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,740
now my ticket is reported and someone is

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:22,450
able to handle it the problematic thing

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,590
might be the second one get root access

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,210
for some people we get paid currently so

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,399
it's more or less my team who needs root

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,610
access because we all have the

00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:36,490
experience that people from the albums

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,919
of the community have their free time

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,610
are not available but the service is

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,519
down so people complaining on app in

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:49,809
opensuse org hey guys for example planet

00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:54,580
opens users down please fix it yes sorry

00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:57,690
yeah look he's gone nobody there nobody

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:01,809
happening a look in so nobody can fix it

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,490
but as my team is normally paid as user

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,879
to deliver all the services it's just

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,789
logical that we want to fix it and to do

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,740
that we need just root access getting on

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,480
a machine fixing it for those machines

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,850
that we provide on our own that's

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,620
normally not a problem but we need is

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,750
also for those external machines

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,120
becoming more and more important for all

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:26,590
the community guys and that's the reason

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,870
for it yes so don't be surprised when

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,360
you asked for some numbers or some email

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,899
addresses just to reach the

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,190
administrators of their original

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:39,100
machines yes have all available updates

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:42,279
installed all the time just to avoid

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,039
some security leaks secure the machines

00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:48,639
and servers I guess everyone agrees with

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,110
this is a good idea is monitoring so

00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:55,269
maybe we can fix the problem before

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:57,129
anyone else notice it have backups as we

00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:00,190
know it is already in the past maybe it

00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,679
is important to have backups especially

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,490
when people start avella peeing on a

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:09,600
production service

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:12,130
and yeah shut down unneeded services

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,110
because we have many many services and

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,620
less and less people we just need to

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:21,010
decide what can we do what can we do

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,710
with the time that we have left and we

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,710
decided okay if the service is not

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:29,440
longer used we will just simply shut it

00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,690
down if it's a virtual machine okay just

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,679
save the image back so we can restart it

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:38,320
anyway but that will happen and we agree

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,380
that we will review all the running

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,920
services every six months if it's worth

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,260
running them or just shut them down and

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:52,200
get rid of it get rid of the

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:55,620
administrative part yeah that's it

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,210
that's the opensuse infrastructure I

00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,780
guess it's easy I hope it's

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,240
understandable and with this simple

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:11,200
basic rules I guess we should be able to

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:14,320
make it ah here i have the UL so so

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:21,100
questions questions i already gathered

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:23,260
not yet often people ask me Oh what

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:30,960
operating system you using yes of course

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:30,960
what do you think only of Zuzu hey okay

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:38,800
yes mostly open Susan because we also

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,309
uses suse linux enterprise server and

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,910
some packages that we have in a special

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:50,260
infrastructure repository but trust me

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,300
that's it it's suzy running there Souza

00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,510
driving the Souza infrastructure hey

00:21:52,300 --> 00:22:01,240
guys eat your own dog food we're doing

00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:06,160
it all time what should you do if you

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,110
want to start a new service easy isn't

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,920
it

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,020
just convince us you currently have a

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:18,950
mailing list sooner or later we have

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:21,360
ticket system start asking questions

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,809
with the virtualization structure that

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,820
we have we can provide virtual machines

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:29,040
and if your services gets more and more

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,240
important you can think about more

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:37,260
storage maybe maybe not but we will see

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,850
it's all accessible the only point is we

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,950
will not ask around in the community

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,590
does someone like to have a virtual

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:48,210
machine no its you need to come up to us

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:52,110
and ask us sorry for this but I have not

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:58,140
this brain scanner available like the

00:22:52,110 --> 00:23:01,530
NSA has yes I already requested one

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,299
button I'm just on the waiting list ok

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,850
can you join a team yes of course we're

00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:10,440
hiring ok if you don't want ask us again

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:15,990
and we are also available on the web

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:22,530
channel so no way to hide anymore start

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:25,020
join the team ah anything I can already

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:30,270
helped with now it becomes interesting

00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:35,030
for me because yes we have backend admin

00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:38,010
positions and as you see there are a lot

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,549
there are services up and running the

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:46,200
community uses small s on a daily base

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:47,960
which have now active maintainer and me

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,270
and my team is only doing the basic

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,120
administration on those machines means

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:56,809
installing the updates what what we

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,280
normally don't do as administrators is

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:02,580
developing on the code that is really

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,090
used by the community so if you have for

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:08,809
example a bomber opensuse org yes the

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:11,669
main exist yes application exists

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:15,150
unmaintained since around two or three

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:18,270
years if you have a look at connect yes

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,559
from time to time if the opensuse team

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:24,070
has a little spare time they

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,749
start working on it oh that's it the

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,879
same for all that other stuff that is

00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:31,779
listed here even as Heather mentioned

00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:35,019
our main starting point in the web for

00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:39,789
new users has not seen any update since

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:42,309
two years sad story and always people

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,870
come to me and say hey but you can do it

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:45,850
you are the atmosphere this and say yes

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,509
I can keep those machine up and running

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,580
and I'm doing this for many years now

00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:56,950
but it's not me who is providing the

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:59,049
content so if we find some students if

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:02,019
you find some interesting people inside

00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:04,990
the community you say hey maybe this is

00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:08,619
something I can grow with I can train

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:14,340
myself learning new languages learning

00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:17,499
other things yes ask us we have some

00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,990
nice applications where you can dive

00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:23,080
into where you can just increase your

00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:27,070
coding skills and maybe get the benefit

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,320
that you're then more or less welcomed

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:32,259
inside the community depending on what

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:37,840
your code and of course you have some

00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:41,169
reputation afterwards so yes it's a long

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,809
list currently with let's say open

00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:46,980
position unmaintained hosts if you say

00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:50,019
it in that way and what I hope is that

00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:54,389
we get more and more people on board who

00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:57,970
say yes I want to start with for example

00:25:54,389 --> 00:26:00,639
mailing list administration or those

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,740
work clothes that are already requested

00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:05,649
but nobody's handling it thanks to the

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,629
board someone step in already but as we

00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:10,450
discussed yesterday maybe it's not so

00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:12,519
good that some board members taking over

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,259
administrative tasks because you have to

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,499
decide about those things not

00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:19,269
implemented so yes welcome but maybe

00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:22,149
there are other guys who can help you

00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:24,639
and so yes for example for this position

00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:28,269
we also have a mentor in a tutor or

00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:31,450
maybe so yes you will be covered we will

00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:33,970
guide you don't feel alone when you say

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,210
eh maybe I have an interest in some of

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,390
those

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:38,950
but I don't know what it is it's not

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,610
that we say okay here's the root access

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:44,830
have fun yeah so we will guide you

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,690
through the process via the herb channel

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,510
to help you we have marinus to help you

00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,300
and give I guess a lot of other things

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,730
where we can help you and then maybe

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,830
next time we have a big round here with

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,530
all those administrators of opens use

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:07,810
the infrastructure and then we drink a

00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:10,360
beer or two okay as shown already i have

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,700
just five minutes left or so so now it's

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:19,330
time to ask some questions some

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:22,720
important questions that's good so it

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,410
wasn't important can we have this

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,410
microphone please

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,650
playing games it's not important

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,480
questions at the beginning of of this

00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:52,280
ladder you mentioned about the hardware

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:54,400
in Susie and open to open to the

00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,140
groceries I want to know is how many

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,570
emotions are running with the opensuse

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,290
view surveys are the water immersion

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,380
hardware a physical motion where is the

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:11,480
location because in the open to the view

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:24,410
service it's mostly feel so where are

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:26,990
they running where it's a look at that

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,320
can you tell me the location of appeal

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,320
service

00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:53,680
how many machines are they water

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:58,900
immersion of faith commercial but he'll

00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,570
sew around 45 machines increased since a

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,870
few months with the caltrak okay thank

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,870
you oh

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:21,850
my question is is there a list of for

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,220
what all those services are I mean how

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:28,450
are we going to know about what these

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:30,190
services do and to get to know a bit and

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,100
see whether we are interesting that's

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:37,570
number one and number two is as I

00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:40,000
understand you've got you said that you

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,500
have some guys that they come in they

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,530
fix the service that they go back to

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:50,260
their real work it may be a case that in

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:53,050
order to attract more it means to do

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,570
this sort of work is to give some sort

00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:59,440
of reward say and the end of the year

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,060
you know the you qualify them that they

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,330
are capable of doing that work and

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,930
perhaps they win their entry into the

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:10,570
next opensuse conference that maybe

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:15,240
somewhere that's would be a lot of money

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:18,790
so involved in now petting it by itself

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,720
so that's a proposal to the bottom of

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:25,660
the to the ball if they get now accept

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,840
that but if we can find out a little bit

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:33,250
about these services what do they do and

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:36,280
what sort of skills do you need to be

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:43,230
able to get to see whether we can help

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,230
on those ad will be in star yes thanks

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,820
i would give it to the board

00:30:52,940 --> 00:31:02,480
I make sure that they are interested so

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:06,470
a great dog thank you for that one quick

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,380
question can I cover it what can I have

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:14,810
root would hurt hurt yes of course just

00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,520
build it yeah so the question is how

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,350
hard is it for you to trust new people

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,410
and give them access to some of the

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,730
crucial services that are running

00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,950
normally for me it's not so problematic

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,860
because right now the infrastructure is

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:33,410
ready to allow remote access to those

00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:39,050
virtual machines we are cloud and so if

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:44,120
we trust them first guide them and see

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:46,940
how they work it's just easy to see if

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,940
they do some crazy stuff I just want to

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,550
learn and improve their skills so yes

00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,550
everyone makes errors so when you have a

00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:58,700
new guy probably the first thing that he

00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:00,770
does is make the service quality not so

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,490
good because he needs to try out some

00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:09,560
things but that's normal that's what I

00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:13,100
expect so if the guy is asking to get

00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:17,870
access to service we will find some way

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,890
to arrange it and then we will see does

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,890
it answer your question

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:37,830
yeah what are the minimum requirements

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:41,640
that you have for somebody to be an

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:44,450
admin for any of the services so you

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,340
know you get young guys at home that are

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:50,580
in the spare time contributing and they

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,760
they like the idea of sysadmin kind of

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,530
button and maybe they have an idea that

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,470
they want to be a sysadmin in the future

00:32:55,530 --> 00:33:01,110
so this is kind of a good you know first

00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,530
step of building up some port bali own

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:09,060
experience and knowledge etc so for

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:12,570
those that are remote looking in what's

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:16,530
the minimum entry barrier to to be able

00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:19,260
to help out in general the minimum

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:25,920
barrier is you should know something

00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:28,850
about opensuse linux but for most of the

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,500
rest we can guide you we can assist you

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,800
so from my team is a bit different so i

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:38,640
have just lpa a certified administrators

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:41,040
in my team but they are able to help as

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,800
much as they can to guide those people

00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,140
and we already had some community users

00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,430
having access on community opens with

00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:53,690
the arc working on some rake scripts

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:56,910
crazy stuff even I don't understand and

00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:01,320
we came to the agreement that they just

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:04,890
need some script running as Udo allowing

00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:09,480
them to restart their egg server from

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:12,570
time to time and if this is one of the

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,740
outcomes of discussion it's perfect

00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:19,560
because I guess everyone knows that we

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,860
are all just humans making errors could

00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,429
not know everything and if we have some

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:29,820
trust relationship inside and i will

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:32,370
come on your side saying okay i will

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,610
trust you that you will do nothing ugly

00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:39,810
with the service I guess we get

00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:42,820
something back so I will trust those who

00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,070
came and say okay I want to do

00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:49,630
I knew I want to help and then we can

00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:54,400
see if this trust is worth 10 so you'll

00:34:49,630 --> 00:35:03,030
trust me personally yes always you're

00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:06,640
doing a good job there's one more thing

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:13,840
these services are 24 by 7 aren't they

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:16,600
know what are they 13 by five we don't

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,300
have any service level agreements for

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,790
any opensuse infrastructure we are

00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,200
always trying in our free and spare time

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,450
over the weekend when most of the

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,300
community guys are online trying to

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,900
build their stuff to be there and have

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:36,550
an eye on it but it's our free time as

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:38,350
administrators at Souza and the build

00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,240
service itself especially the build

00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:43,030
service which is available on build

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,090
opensuse org does not have any service

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:48,670
level agreements yet and I guess it

00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,610
would also be hard to get some service

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:55,390
level agreements there because who

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:58,630
should do it that is go to the hardware

00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:02,470
as well is the hardware 24 by 7 carpet

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:04,780
all the hardware is not 24 by 7 covered

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,970
its professional hardware so we don't

00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,840
buy the cheapest desktop machines to

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:13,150
build something but again normally it's

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,160
my team taking care of all that stuff

00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,950
and we are there from monday nine

00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,300
o'clock until friday five o'clock in the

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:25,240
afternoon and that's it so if the main

00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,530
server would die on a saturday it's

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,840
probably that a build service will be

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,960
down until monday morning nine o'clock

00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,180
when we arrive so all that you see

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,960
normally over the weekend that has been

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,570
fixed it's just we as administrators

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,990
inside the community jumping in and

00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,600
helping the people so if you want to

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,310
have the build servers 24-7 available

00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,930
you need probably some service level

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,480
agreement and then you need to pay

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,600
people for it and that's what we don't

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,600
have

00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:00,100
it's different for other build service

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,650
structures that we have inside the

00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,180
company also outside but for opensuse

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,180
that has simply no service level

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:22,850
