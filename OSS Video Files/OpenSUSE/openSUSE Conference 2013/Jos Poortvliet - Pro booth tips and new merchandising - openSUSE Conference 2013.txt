Title: Jos Poortvliet - Pro booth tips and new merchandising - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	How to prepare for, set up and staff an openSUSE booth? This community manager has visited countless booths all around the world and shares his best tips and tricks with you!

In the second half he'll present our new merchandising plans. SUSE used to send out merchandising (mostly DVD's) to the community of ambassadors around the world. This process was costly, yet not very effective. A plan was created, research was done, stuff was decided on and we're ready to move forward with designing and printing new posters, stickers, t-shirts, caps, flags and whatnot. This presentation will give an update on the current status in preparation for later discussions and decisions on improvements.

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,309
to talk about in the next 30 35 minutes

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,800

going to come from us to you are both

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,960
why do we have both well obviously we

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,110
have both at technical conference

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,170
usually to make there and to inform

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,820
people there about what we do right we

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,860
target newbies people who don't know

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,900
much about open source and free software

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,119
and are just curious about that whole

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,840
you know penguin thing and come and

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,520
check it out we talk targets people who

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,979
are already linux users who know what

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
they're doing maybe have you know dumb

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,840
their first step in even compiling or

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,430
programming and the third group we're

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,750
targeting are people who really know

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,430
what they're doing there may be our

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,680
contributors from other projects there

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,930
have been around free software and they

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:58,229
of course already know open Susan now

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,180
let's start with the beginners the thing

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,610
is you know with beginners we just want

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,490
them to try out opensuse that's the main

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,890
thing if they try it out and they don't

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,470
like it that's okay we just want them to

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,090
try it I try to help them with that we

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,630
answer the questions they have we tell

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,880
them of course why this you'll be trying

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,370
opensuse but that's why we're there for

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,500
beginners just the basic maybe we help

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,240
them install it maybe we just give them

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:30,070
a DVD or we tell them where to download

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:32,200
that the more knowledge Linux users are

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,780
people who often come to our booth of

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,790
questions they already know opensuse

00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,530
they might be using it or they're using

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,080
another distro and they're having some

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,810
problem or another or that just wonder

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,150
why would I triad opensuse and I haven't

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,850
tried it in a long time or they come and

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,860
say look I read an article on lwn about

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,920
OBS what the heck is it what are you

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,780
guys doing there so we were mostly here

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,190
to answer their questions and help them

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,870
with the things they're trying to do and

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,820
last but not least we have the hackers

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,970
the developers and the D free software

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,620
people now again think about people who

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,810
contribute to other projects people who

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,880
maybe are contributing already to Debian

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,690
or a boon to or people who work on gnome

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,510
or KDE or LibreOffice or small projects

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,650
now we are here for them for two reasons

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,600
first we want basically to be there you

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,730
want to show them that we're here where

00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,130
the geek girls are still relevant we're

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,570
doing cool stuff so we want to tell them

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,840
all the interesting stuff that we're

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,700
doing maybe they won't be using it but

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,830
when somebody asks them about this

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,720
opensuse thing at least you won't tell

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,760
the other person that opensuse doesn't

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,770
exist anymore right we just need them to

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,270
see us just need to be there for them

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,160
and second we want them actually to be

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,590
positive about us know that we matter

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,320
even if you're in a bundle user we do

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,650
stuff that's interesting be at OPA be it

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,270
obs okay we would like those people to

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,950
still recognize that we are doing

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,380
interesting things this is part of being

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,660
open I'll get to that later but we're an

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,850
open community we work with others we

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,860
have no problem with fedora and a bundle

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,350
people as a matter of fact we would like

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,040
them to like us do and that's I think

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,420
good thing and I like it if we try to

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,700
communicate this to people I think

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,200
that's important and of course if people

00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,169
want to get involved I that's awesome

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,310
right but you might not get so many

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,560
people at conferences

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,510
forcing a project and hey that's fine ok

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,760
we're there very much due to evangelize

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,500
just get a word out people will probably

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,680
only get involved after I've followed

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,300
the mailing list for a while so it's

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,650
very unlikely you'll talk to someone at

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,000
the conference week later they're on the

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,070
Magnusson tree we collected there

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,110
committing packages no yes it's just not

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,910
how it works you might talk to someone

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,860
the next year maybe they are committing

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,380
packages too obvious there's a gap there

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,210
so I also think you shouldn't expect too

00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,040
much now those are the people and talk

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:05,889
about the work we do let's talk about

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:08,950
the basics of having a booth now how to

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,900
represent opensuse properly at the end

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:16,770
of this part i will share a couple of

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:21,010
tips i think one of them yes most them

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,720
yeah that's the touchpad i am sorry so i

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,540
think one of the most important things

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,270
but opensuse is the first letters ok

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,950
open we're a very open community you

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,510
know we don't always have to be having

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,060
everyone although i personally think

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,100
that's a good thing to do but i think

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,380
that being friends that i mentioned is

00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,300
important it's part of who we are we

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,810
like to work with others we like to be

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:46,510
open and collaborative so especially i

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,250
think also for the experts and for the

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,300
newbies and for the advanced users these

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,270
matters ok our reputation as a project

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,889
now when you set up a booth you should

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,169
reflect this i think this is how you

00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:03,700
should not do it it's it's a traditional

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,950
bullet you put a table you put people

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,020
behind it often with the laptops facing

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,729
themselves which is you know well the

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,669
back of a laptop is usually quite pretty

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,410
but it's not very useful and that's

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,150
where you go and sit this is a picture

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,410
from Marcus myself from officers

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:22,780
conference loss here now this is booth

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,460
how you should do it you make an open

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,919
space put the tables on the sides and

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:33,520
now people can come in and actually talk

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:35,020
and here you see well here you see

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,450
basically the booth at lenox west

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,950
northwest in action alright this this is

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,900
a good booth in my opinion

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,910
and well there are a couple of more

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,010
examples of like you know create an open

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,620
space here we have like some room where

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,560
people can sit and you know listen to

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:55,940
booth talk so I'll come to that later

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,640
this works right now here people sit

00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,350
down this is actually another example of

00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,630
the bad stuff of people hacking at the

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,460
booth which you shouldn't do but there

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,530
is a presentation happening I think to

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,750
the left here so it's not as bad as it

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,670
looks but it does bring us to the point

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,830
of don't sit at your booth and hack

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,450
there unless you do with on a big screen

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,760
as a demonstration that's fine that's

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,220
cool but don't fill up the booth with

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,440
people sitting there and hacking because

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,990
that's not very inviting and open I know

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,480
it's real hard to not do it by the way I

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,280
mean I find it hard as well for myself

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,710
but it's really important not to do it

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:39,500
find the heck space most golfers have

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:41,030
room for it yeah and it just other that

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,550
people like to leave their stuff at the

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,710
booth yeah well often you can put it on

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,970
your table or something but don't make a

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,850
big mountain in the middle where you're

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,980
supposed to stand okay so this is about

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,260
the kind of the setup the design of the

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,080
bullets try to make it open and you know

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,930
don't sit behind the table that's just

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,640
not a very inviting thing to do if you

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,490
sit behind the table people really have

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,170
to go to you and have this distance

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,870
between you and you have to reach over

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,270
it right mentally this is just not nice

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,520
if its opening you're standing in front

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,050
and people come that's a lot closer and

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,600
easier I could do that too but I want

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,670
this is between you and me Hannah so the

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,910
second thing I would like you to

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,220
represent opuses well and that has

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,990
multiple parts but I think an important

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,120
thing is spreading our culture song who

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,790
opensuse is I already talked about you

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,770
on the open part but i think this this

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,650
slide really represents a couple of

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,750
cultural things that opensuse has that

00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,550
especially experts actually will usually

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,830
find desirable because these are things

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,630
that will make us different from other

00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,570
distros and i think in a lot of points

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,360
very good whether it's better it's I

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,300
guess up to

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,540
it's opinion but we have documentation

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,550
that explains these things right I don't

00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,250
go into it now because we are a bit

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:07,460
strapped on time but if you want I could

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,230
go and explain this little deeper and of

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,420
course your dare telling people about

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:15,020
what we do our technology how we work

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,090
the open build service tumbleweed Souza

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,460
studio all the cool technologies that

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,830
come out of our project and obviously

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,420
you need to talk about this and we

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:28,420
include with the current packets that we

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,710
send out we include a letter with

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,930
information about these things so you

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,600
actually already have some of these

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,400
arguments and talking points and the

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,080
plan is of course for us to create more

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,390
of it and there already is a lot more on

00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,790
the wiki so there's a lot of information

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,860
that if you don't follow opensuse via

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,930
planet opensuse news they lose the door

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,970
every day which you know not everybody

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,590
does you can still get a lot of

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,940
important information because we have it

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,000
on the wiki especially for our

00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,200
ambassadors and i'm fairly certain most

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,520
people have no idea that we do that now

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,860
let's go for some of the pro tips there

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,560
are two posters from linux tak and they

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,630
both represent some of the things that i

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,310
make a booth well make the difference

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,910
between the good and a really good booth

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,150
yeah now tip 1 if you have things to

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,950
give away and you usually have it's a

00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,350
nice idea to ask for a little donation

00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,770
for each of them and then donate that

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,230
money to the event where you are at the

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,700
events like that very much which usually

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,340
means next year they'll give you a

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,670
better bigger or better position booth I

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,100
points for that and the audience likes

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,060
it very much too because you're

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,320
supporting the event they're going to

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,930
and they're going there because I think

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,050
it's cool so you score point both with

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,250
the organization and with the visitors

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,810
obviously if you can use the money

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,110
yourself very well then of course you

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,470
can use it for that as well but this

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,510
yeah we have given away a fair amount of

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,880
beer at events for like 1 euro each and

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,800
then give the money to the organization

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,850
and that's well you know you support the

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,889
event

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,980
it's good for everyone a big win win i

00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:12,410
think a second thing here on the rights

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,199
you see a little booth talks scheduled

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,970
so this is something we've done and a

00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,279
couple of events now and it's usually

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,930
very much appreciated you can organize

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,670
little simple talks about various

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:29,630
subjects at the booth now these talks

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:31,639
are usually related to do simply what

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,139
the people at the booth there know about

00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,380
okay they don't have to be about

00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,959
opensuse actually i would say mmm don't

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,579
butter make them about gnome or KDE or

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,550
LibreOffice or things that actually

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:45,980
attracts people who don't really per se

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,870
care about opensuse because you still

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,110
get people to your booth outside of our

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,839
own opensuse fan group so it's also a

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,399
way to do widen the scope it usually

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,949
doesn't attract a whole lot of people

00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,290
but honestly i think it is way better to

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,019
have a chat with five people over 50

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:04,430
because our five people you can respond

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,160
to their questions you can actually have

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,930
a good conversation with 50 well you can

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,300
only do one way communication with that

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,759
so i think this is really a good way to

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,980
attract people to your booth who would

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,939
otherwise not come and have quality

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,589
interactions with them and of course

00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:24,110
conference organizations love it if you

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,370
do this stuff if you go to them you know

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,170
you say look we're going to do this

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,930
thing and our booth where people can

00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,329
come when we give a little presentation

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:34,399
three times a day you know just 20

00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,100
minutes each time can we hang up posters

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,750
to show that we are doing this they will

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,720
allow you to hang up posters all over

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,930
the place that's awesome right people

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,839
will know about the booth and go there

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,750
so this this is promo good promo all

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,819
around by the way talking about hanging

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,829
up posters this is really a good thing

00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:57,079
to do hang up posters that say where is

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,029
your booth and what is there to do to

00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,250
see maybe there are things you get give

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:05,899
away or you just say look our booth is

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:07,850
here find it in the whole 7b area too if

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,759
you ask the organization before they

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,430
usually say yes and very often to my big

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,339
surprise you're the only team that does

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,649
it other will almost never hang up

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:23,389
posters which makes the whole place

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:25,459
look very green which is really cool and

00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:27,199
the fourth is you know and that's

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,089
already what I set with the talks

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,579
connects with other projects okay i

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,649
asked the KDE people for a couple of I

00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:35,959
don't know things for your booth asked

00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,519
the known people if there is no

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,309
LibreOffice Stan but one of you

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,720
sometimes works of LibreOffice try and

00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,490
get some Lear office things at your

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,139
booth disconnecting with other projects

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,029
again brings people to the booth who

00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,980
might not be super interested in

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,809
opensuse but by coming to the booth you

00:13:48,980 --> 00:14:01,249
get a chance to talk to them and this

00:13:50,809 --> 00:14:04,730
really works Richard can you give the

00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:07,369
sack for that so I just to give another

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,490
example of that happening faust em a

00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:13,220
couple of years ago we had the just

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,499
offered the gnome 3 release they the

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,389
gnome 3 booth ended up sending most of

00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,269
their people to ours for a demonstration

00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,350
because our our screens were more

00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,679
impressive our booth with more

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,120
impressive and giving away beer so they

00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,459
ended up with quite a lot of people

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,319
being sent our way well this year at

00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:35,389
lenox tak you can probably see on the

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:37,459
right the fedora beefy miracle logo from

00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,100
their release what we did was we

00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:42,679
collaborate with fedora we had beer they

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,509
had hot dogs and basically everybody

00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,819
went to the fedora booth gave them to us

00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,679
for a beer I mean come on can you do

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,550
anything smarter than that i think it

00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,899
was brilliant wasn't my girl was kind of

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,670
we had a beer with couple of fedora

00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,490
people that's what good ideas come ok so

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:01,399
really work with others other projects

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,439
even winter fedora why not you know I

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,819
think this is part of how open tues is

00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,439
different from other districts because

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,360
mouse wasn't done like this very much

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,730
you know they like to be in their own

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,470
circle but why you know I think we can

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,720
be proud of our geek oh we're doing

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,639
great stuff we don't have to hide from

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,610
other people and keep doing it so this

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,619
this is really something you can make a

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:24,319
difference with that just be open work

00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:27,110
with others people appreciate it they

00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:28,850
they really notice when you don't do

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,180
that when you're like you know in your

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:36,970
own little group I mean this

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:40,510
yeah any more points or questions if not

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,550
let's move on I have a few minor tips

00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,920
about the actual talking to people yeah

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:49,450
I already mentioned about 50,000 times

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,770
to be open and friendly etc and it helps

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,390
you have your story ready of course

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:58,000
again that's why you have the talking

00:15:52,390 --> 00:16:00,670
points 3 extra tips here ok the first

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,760
one is ask questions to draw people in

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,260
so when you're not sitting behind your

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,820
table because I told you not to do that

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,040
but when you're standing in front of the

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,530
table and somebody walks by and looks at

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,280
the flyers and other things ask them do

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,780
you use out / Susan and they'll well say

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,730
yes or no and in both cases you have

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,620
something to talk about done it's not

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,310
difficult right asking questions works

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,380
really well just to start a conversation

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,030
and the second thing is you know don't

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,100
just do a sales pitch you can do with

00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,900
short sales pitch but don't keep talking

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,480
try to figure out what it what they want

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,520
whether the user computer for basically

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,100
keep asking questions to see if opensuse

00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,240
can help them and again be open and if

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,150
they're looking for something that

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,220
opensuse cannot provide tell them to go

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,200
somewhere else I think that's fine be

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,360
helpful at least they will have a good

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,460
memory of opensuse while if you sell

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,920
them something that we can't provide you

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,270
give them a bad experience so it's

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,280
better to tell people look we don't

00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,170
really have that very well you know if

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,520
they say I want a live CD and I want to

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,110
have all the multimedia codecs included

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,240
well you can tell them sue studio you

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,670
can build it yourself but if they're not

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,830
up for that tell them to go to mint okay

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,550
at least again they have a good memory

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:17,380
of us and so be it if we don't do that

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,860
we don't do that right it's it's

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,900
important to be honest and the third tip

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,390
is don't waste your time on negativity

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,330
if people come to you and say everything

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,400
sucks you know I hate green it's a

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,980
terrible color and everything breaks

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,530
when I put it in my computer of course

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,650
you should try to help them but people

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,750
can complain for hours it doesn't help

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,520
anyone especially not you in your

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,740
motivation but also the other people who

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,130
are probably around so when people come

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,800
to

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,930
it's all negative negative negative tell

00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,540
them Luke I'm really sorry about it

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,010
please ask on the forums or ask on a

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,720
mailing list I mean help them to find

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,060
the forums help them to find the mailing

00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,620
list but don't spend too much time or

00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,970
negativity there are other people

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,100
watching and listening and there's much

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,380
better stuff you can do someone is a

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,270
hater will they say haters can hate on

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:13,300
the internet and the internet is always

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:15,520
right now I already saw that we have to

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,740
hurry up so I'm going to skip on these

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,390
unless you really think there are

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:25,780
important tips that should be shared

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:27,340
that I skipped on guys until how long do

00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,140
I have because I thought I had until

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:36,450
three thirty or I mean for 330 initial

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:40,870
time can you check in the schedule I

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:43,890
have to stop now okay well then we miss

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:56,980
entirely on the merchandising I'm sorry

00:18:43,890 --> 00:19:01,360
are you sure okay yeah is that okay okay

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:03,370
if it's a really okay okay if you're

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,660
really okay with it then I will try and

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:09,880
do the merchandising parts now quickly

00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,560
because of course we're at souza we have

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,360
been working on new merchandising and I

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:17,830
think that's quite worth you know

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,120
showing let me see so options

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,240
merchandise and that's what I want to

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,950
talk about now first I want to say our

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,690
artists are doing awesome work that's

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,210
why you see pretty pictures in my slides

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,490
and I want to give a lot of points for

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,470
that now i'm going to quickly talk about

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,990
where we currently are where we are

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,810
going how we're going to go there and

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:41,950
then you will can tell me how you like

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,930
it or dislike it currently we're serving

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,010
up about 100 events all around the world

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:50,050
now what we that we're talking about you

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,640
know you to vent of 10,000 people but

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,350
we're also talking about classrooms

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,660
where an ambassador goes and gives a

00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,250
talk and enhance out some dvds

00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:03,640
so it's all kinds of events now to

00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,760
support this Souza until recently had a

00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,740
demand based system yeah ambassadors

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,140
tell us like look I'm going to give a

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,560
talk down there can you please send us

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,320
some stuff now we put DVDs in the box

00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,630
and well whatever we can find in the

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,490
office that seems to fit with the event

00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,160
sometimes we have good things sometimes

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,520
we don't it depends on the event and we

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,890
send it to them now this is not really

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,350
perfect it's a lot of work for us to

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,940
check if the request is real sometimes

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,400
you get an email from somebody saying

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,440
that you sent me one DVD then you have

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,690
to explain that no we cannot do that the

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,330
minimum amount is 100 when you get an

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:47,140
email then that week later that says can

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:49,090
I then get a hundreds are you sure 99 of

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,010
them aren't going to be thrown away it's

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:56,590
really hard to figure that out so these

00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:00,760
these things you know it's hard to check

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,560
and when you send DVDs I earlier to a

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,800
couple of people talking here when you

00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,530
send a box of 100 dvds to a place for

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,290
example in South America or in Asia it

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,610
can easily cost 500 or even a thousand

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:18,580
euros now 100 dvds costs about seven

00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,980
euros and you send you spent seven

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,770
hundred euros on shipping it that's a

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,810
little bit insane obviously and it's

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,530
something we have been doing a lot so

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:31,450
that's not really efficient we think so

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,240
in short I mean we can't really plan

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,490
what we're doing we don't always do what

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,940
we want to do because we don't send

00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,040
stuff in time we don't really know how

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,930
well we are doing what we do because we

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,850
don't get a lot of feedback in other

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,250
words we're not very happy with it and

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:52,150
honestly I think a lot of you aren't

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:54,580
either and all this is being done by

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,500
Susan because the community it's yeah

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,920
you ask our stuff that we have to figure

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,200
out if we give it or not we often have

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,700
no real good base to decide on so there

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,100
are some randomness there as well it's

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,670
not nice so we have been thinking a lot

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,080
and talking to

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:13,370
lot of people including the Ambassador

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,580
team and ambassador welcoming team other

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,460
people about how can we do this better

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,140
now let's talk about that it would be

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,530
nice if we would know the events in

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,080
advance it would be nice if you would

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:30,980
send good stuff even if we sent a little

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,960
bit less of it and it will be good if we

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,380
will be sure that when we send stuff it

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,540
will actually be used and it will be

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,850
really nice if this would actually be

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,620
planned by the community so that we know

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:45,590
that we don't send it to places where

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,590
it's not needed so this is what we're

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,650
going to try I made a process picture

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm going to skip it the plan the

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,010
detailed proposal what we've done

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,450
initially is to make a list of events

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,400
okay I've been working on this for over

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,440
a year it's based on what we have in our

00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,970
wiki it's based on the things I've been

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,490
asking on the mailing list and are

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,320
talking to people in person I know the

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,990
list is still not complete because there

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,900
are way way more events that could be

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,790
put on but at some point I can't keep

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,490
looking and hoping that I find something

00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:23,240
else so I finally said okay this is the

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,100
list I went over it and I looked at how

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,690
many people are came how big the event

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,760
is what the audience is and all these

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,230
things again I asked a lot of people can

00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,680
you tell me how many people come here

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,560
how important is this what kind of

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,750
people are their students businessman

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,230
etc etc etc based on all that

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:45,050
information I said okay these events we

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,720
really need to go to with a couple of

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:51,050
people from Susan Wright big events like

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,790
force them for example then we looked at

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,530
other events and said okay this is the

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,390
kind of event that needs to have good

00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,480
opensuse presence so we need to send a

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:02,660
big box there with materials another

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,550
event we send a smaller box or we have

00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,410
to support it in other ways like for

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:13,120
example if money and a smaller event

00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:13,120
