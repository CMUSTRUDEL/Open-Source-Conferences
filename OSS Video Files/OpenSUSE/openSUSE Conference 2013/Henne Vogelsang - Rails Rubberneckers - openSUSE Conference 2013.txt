Title: Henne Vogelsang - Rails Rubberneckers - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	This is a get-together of people who don't want to take their first steps Ruby on Rails alone. Are you already familiar with a scripting language such as the Ps (python/perl/php) or even ruby? Are you fascinated by today's web-apps and APIs? Why don't you swing by, mingle and get started together with other rubberneckers on Ruby on Rails, the open source web-framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. This workshop requires no special knowledge, we will use the web browser and the command line to go through it. Bring your laptop, preferably with openSUSE 12.3 installed!

	00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:14,099
alright so this is an introduction

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:17,240
workshop to ruby on rails it will be

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,910
twofold I will introduce you to the

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,590
concepts of ruby on rails and then

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,080
afterwards I will try to go through

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,779
creating this very simple web app with

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,340
you so for the first part you just have

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:37,440
to listen but for the second part you

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:52,079
need your laptop and you need to follow

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:54,780
my lead so hello so this is what we are

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,870
going to do today I will explain rates

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,960
to you you will get wells running and

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:07,680
then we kick off a rails app so first

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,409
the egg explanation I'm sure a lot of

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:17,360
you have heard about Ruby on Rails maybe

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,360
use it before stuff like that

00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,530
24 web apps and web apps are simple

00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,610
things there are only presentation and

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:31,640
manipulation of data right there is no

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:35,330
magic to it it's just you have your data

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:41,060
and we present it somehow and then maybe

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:44,150
you have your users many manipulated so

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:49,100
r else has some specific philosophies

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:52,340
about that and that it's what makes it

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:57,290
do currently the crooked on the block

00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,500
it's not the tools it's not the Ruby

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,590
language it's not stuff like that it's

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,740
the philosophy behind it so I I think

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:11,380
I'll explain a little bit what this is

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,930
about it's actually this is the

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:19,250
philosophy of rails I like it because

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,680
it's also my life philosophy so where's

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:25,570
is about getting done it's not

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:33,470
about having it your way it's about

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:37,760
getting a web app fast so this is what

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:43,340
rates what really makes rails stand up

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:46,430
and what has it set apart from all the

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,920
other web frameworks and PHP and stuff

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,470
like that you know it's really the

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,400
framework is has one philosophy is

00:02:51,470 --> 00:03:00,950
getting done so how does a drug do

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:04,610
that first of all grants is a framework

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,170
and as you can guess from the name

00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:14,799
framework it gives you a framework it so

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:19,670
it's about limitation it you can only do

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:22,880
things in a certain way of course there

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:26,000
are different ways to do some stuff but

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,260
it limits you in your tools in

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,090
language in your in the way you work so

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:41,140
it's about limitation and race is also

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:46,880
about convention and convention means

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:50,570
only if you want to do the things not

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:54,050
the standard way you have to configure

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:56,230
stuff if you use systemic way you don't

00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:00,709
have to configure anything no

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:03,560
configuration files for for the web app

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,470
no configuration eyes or pesky

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,239
confirmation files for the databases

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:17,950
stuff like that so it's really about

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:22,550
convention and grades is also the third

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:25,190
philosophy Andreas's division so

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,530
actually division of labor there are

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,700
certain paths in your web app that have

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:34,220
has have certain duties to fulfill and

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:40,910
nothing else so it's really about

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:43,100
division of labor and the thing you

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,390
probably have heard is this MVC model

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:53,960
view controller and I will explain that

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:57,919
later so each part of your web app has a

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:02,750
specific task and only that task this

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:06,530
makes it possible to change one thing

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:11,960
without touching the other and this

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:14,870
makes it very fast to develop rails apps

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,740
and it makes it all so very easy to

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,320
maintain rents web apps because you

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:28,060
don't have to touch everything you only

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:32,140
have the specific parts so another

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,479
philosophy of rails this variation and

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,840
you probably know that as Yeah right

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:44,690
don't repeat yourself variation

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:47,389
you can have you shouldn't have many

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:51,380
different butterflies implemented you

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:55,780
should have one butterfly and then have

00:05:51,380 --> 00:06:00,860
a variation in color so this makes it

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:04,220
very easy to add stuff so you don't have

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:08,660
to always repeat yourself and write new

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:11,960
coat this is also like I said to get

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,510
 done because you have to write less

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,750
code and in the end you have to maintain

00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,720
this code because you only vary this

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:26,630
stuff and not rewrite it from scratch

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:31,370
all the time and the most important

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:34,639
philosophy of rails is verification it's

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:38,419
testing driven right you implement

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,800
something from the test case that means

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:46,070
you first describe how you would like it

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,950
to work then write a test case and then

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,260
that test case will always verify that

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,470
it still works so every change you do

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,849
you run the test afterwards it will just

00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:04,039
verify that your stuff is still working

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:07,970
and reg brings a very powerful testing

00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:13,970
framework for that so this is these are

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:16,250
the core philosophies behind rates it's

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,520
convention only if you want to do it

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:23,479
your way you have to configure stuff its

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,660
division there are only certain parts

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:32,810
order your app is partitioned in certain

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:35,780
parts that have a specific duty to

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:39,650
fulfill its variation not don't repeat

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,820
yourself and it's very complicated test

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:48,180
stuff so

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:51,550
oh let's go into details before we can

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:57,880
work together in this workshop we got

00:07:51,550 --> 00:08:01,270
installer rails or Ruby will be use the

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,510
language behind rails so yeah we got

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,930
install Ruby and opensuse which is

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,450
probably on your laptop drinks Ruby but

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,030
not always in the latest and greatest

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,030
version because Ruby and ruby on rails

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:20,260
are very fairly new they are moving very

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,350
fast but don't worry we have this

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,290
awesome build service project level

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,090
language with Ruby where you can get

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,250
always the latest and greatest full

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,979
version so you should install the

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:41,500
package from that service

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:45,430
repository now either via last of your

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,920
zipper or whatever if you need help just

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,760
tell me you can also just visit this URL

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,330
and it will show you installation

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,330
instructions

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,440
please let you know hold goals

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:25,600
so you can install it to ya

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,020
No

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:47,720
what it is okay but it's it's better if

00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:51,850
used the OBS project because it's Ruby

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,850
and rails are moving very fast

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:07,820
nothing except if you're using rails and

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:12,130
Ruby already but I adult and it's not

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,130
used by the system so it's okay

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:52,650
there is oh it's okay just click on it

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:58,850
and so anyone has problems I see people

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:58,850
with paper they have a hard time stop

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,830
sorry

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,710
oh it's sweet point oh

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:50,650
yeah you should go to that side who has

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:50,650
Ruby installed after waiting

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,570
and yet if you have Ruby installed you

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,350
can verify that it works with Ruby desh

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,350
ki

00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,680
you

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,550
hmm

00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,830
is it working the boot service

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,830
Oh

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,900
for anyone still has problems installing

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,900
Ruby I can help

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,490
No

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,540
so where's Ruby installed now

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,800
okay just verify it works with Ruby dash

00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,800
V

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:28,230
so if you have Ruby installed we gotta

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:32,100
install raids and raise this Ruby

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,889
extension and Ruby extensions and

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,319
libraries are handled with their own

00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:41,669
package manager which is called Ruby

00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:45,739
gems it's a simple package manager like

00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:49,049
any other like zipper or a get or even

00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:53,699
very similar to pip for the Python

00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:58,619
framework and blah blah blah so you can

00:14:53,699 --> 00:15:03,689
use it to to Ruby gems to install update

00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:07,499
remove and stop stuff like that so you

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:10,559
need to call the gem which is the

00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:14,609
command line for the Ruby gems and gem

00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:19,379
install Reds this will fetch the latest

00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:28,079
rails version that there is from the

00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:30,859
Ruby gems repository on the internet so

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,859
install rate

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,709
and let me know how it goes there's

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,709
problems I can help you

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,680
the party is going on obviously

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:19,610
so where else in store now no one else

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:34,580
sorry Oh shoo okay let's see

00:16:51,170 --> 00:17:00,660
while we're waiting on the internet as

00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:02,310
always there are rubygems is not only

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,680
the package manager but also the

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:11,390
repository of all the Ruby extensions

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,390
and there is a lot of stuff for me and

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:18,240
you have frameworks like rails you have

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:23,689
library extensions that make it possible

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:26,250
to to quote some stuff you have

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:28,319
applications in there you have command

00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,490
line clients and their stuff like that

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:41,040
it's a whole world of stuff for Ruby and

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:50,120
movie onwards finished so with raisins

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:50,120
at stor-it-now know right

00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,240
you can't find a header file why is it

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:06,000
looking forward to be done it how it's

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:14,700
probably building something but then you

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,860
need to install with ever so it's it's

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,860
very a very basic package

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:53,350
so you have rails no stupid internet so

00:18:44,170 --> 00:19:01,210
I so slow oh yeah you need to install

00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:10,750
the actually dash devil the program may

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:15,840
not know who be you me go steady to be

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:22,690
oh you need install Ruby you stash devil

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:32,220
with people on the package development

okay so now that we have been solved

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:23,760
rails we ought to use it right Red's the

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,800
package you just installed brings a new

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:31,080
command into your system which is the

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:34,170
waves command and you can simply use it

00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:40,200
to create a new application and it will

00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:42,810
set up all you need to run so go to some

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:48,030
directory where you can where you can

00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:53,840
write and call rails new my app this

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,840
will create a new grads application

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,650
good

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,889
Brooks

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:32,590
sorry it's like a nice evening still

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,590
running

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,240
hmm

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:19,259
like reaction yeah depends on where you

00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:21,690
have called gem install well let's root

00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:25,499
then it's system wide if you call it as

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:34,669
usual in your home if you call it excuse

00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:34,669
of them in your homes and system-wide

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:45,120
no you

00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:12,460
tri-rail stash and then tap maybe this

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:18,399
ass okay so for those of you have

00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:20,950
weapons stored race with s route you

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:41,070
have the command is not raised but

00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:43,870
raised to point o again hit enter so

00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:46,590
because when you stop with you it's not

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,590
store

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,809
raised it's working

00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:32,380
who has created the new app okay not

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,380
enough

00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:49,210
we also for you

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:27,769
so yes the my app directory done q

00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:44,270
oh you already have stuff that is nasty

00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,630
yeah you should

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:23,440
no that's okay yes

00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:56,010
okay so when you run that command you

00:32:52,620 --> 00:33:01,559
see it outputs a lot of stuff like it

00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:04,760
has created directories files blah blah

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,559
blah configuration this is the

00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,970
convention part and the framework part

00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:14,220
of the philosophy right if we just

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:19,350
create a new app and there's a standard

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:27,630
way web app is set up so it's a simple

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:32,760
command to just do that so you can

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:35,820
always already view your app when you go

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,710
into the directory my app and call rails

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:48,000
server and then go to this URL so it's

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:52,130
localhost foreign port 3000 so just go

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,909
into your into your my app directory

00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,909
called a server

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,720

your and see how it goes robot

00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:43,359
it's a very basic package everybody has

00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:43,359
to invent their own cool so go to go

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:20,209
so you guys are still installing gems

00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:29,989
okay but anyway now where's the way up a

00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:38,630
few ways if we called web server okay in

00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:40,839
the console but there is nothing in

00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,839
there

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:55,990
there's no need to do that in the my app

00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:59,280
directory that you have created you know

00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,280
you remember where this

00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:18,430
yes okay there you go more problems

00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:40,180

00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,130
stocking or something

00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:17,000
so change so everybody can see it's

00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:20,170
raised up the campaign obviously robot

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,170
what's with you

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:45,070
oh it shouldn't be that much okay

00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:10,440
there no luck only two left cool

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:29,710
okay so but basically what we have done

00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:32,120
I was creating a new rails app and se s

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,460
most of you can see it's already

00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:42,380
functioning so it's already serving

00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:48,730
pages and that's you know half the stuff

00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:53,390
great stuff just serving HTML pages so

00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:58,120
let's kick off some stuff because up to

00:45:53,390 --> 00:46:01,910
now we just have to standard ransom and

00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:04,100
if you look at into your directory you

00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:07,790
see a lot of different files and a lot

00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:15,400
of different directories and stuff like

00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:18,650
that and that is the separation I

00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:26,150
philosophy I have talked told you about

00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:31,640
before so you have your app directory if

00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:35,470
you look into that you see more

00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:40,370
directories which are called assets

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:43,400
controller model views and that is the

00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:46,790
separation that that I previously talked

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:53,420
to you about so and this concept of

00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:55,330
model view controller means that you

00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:59,840
have your data and you want to

00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:02,540
manipulate it and display it so you have

00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:09,130
to have your data somewhere so it's in

00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:09,130
the database and a model is the

00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:17,870
representation of the table in the

00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:22,390
database in your rates and so down any

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:27,700
models in Europe yet but remodel guides

00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:31,160
the database then you have controllers

00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:34,460
controllers take input from the

00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:38,180
browser or from the user and do

00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:41,840
something with it maybe they asked a

00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:44,570
model for information like if you have

00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,750
in your database row with people and

00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:51,250
names attached to them it might ask the

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:58,160
model for the name of a specific person

00:47:51,250 --> 00:48:02,860
and then display the stuff through views

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:06,650
and that's also a director in the app

00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:11,030
directory called views and the views are

00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:16,720
simple you could use simple HTML files

00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:16,720
but they are mostly used with some some

00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:28,490
how do you college handle and stuff like

00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:34,370
that oh yeah they're they're using

00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:38,570
template fights so explore your stuff in

00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:41,390
your Maya directory open some files look

00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:47,560
at them and if you have questions just

00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:47,560
ask me I'm here

00:48:50,609 --> 00:49:19,739
oh gee I ein file which whole CD used to

00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:30,210
also come with you I will just a common

00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:43,680
topic month me just ego in order by

00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:46,400
Shaam let's bundle under andy you know

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,400
install

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:09,310
so you can go get the configuration the

00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:13,170
gym fire there's a rip me in there all

00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,170
standards movie stuff

00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:32,690
see our strip stylesheets images could

00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:42,619
have most of staff a success the stuff

00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:45,949
that make you fabrication work it's also

00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:48,549
public directory test directory just

00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:48,549
explore a bit

00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:04,240
so up until now we just have created an

00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:07,809
empty app if you go through it it will

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:10,119
just serve for standard HTML page from

00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:16,660
the from the rails server you have

00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:19,240
caught and it doesn't have any data it

00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:24,099
doesn't have any controller it doesn't

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:30,369
have anything just the super view so we

00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:33,059
have to create some way to show

00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:36,780
something else than the standard page

00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:39,910
for that we need to create a controller

00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:43,599
because if you want to display something

00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:46,420
a controller needs to take the input

00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:52,680
from the browser it will show me some

00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:56,740
page and generate or not generate but

00:51:52,680 --> 00:52:00,940
show the view files so with the erase

00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:04,750
command either with 1.9 or 2 point 0 or

00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:12,309
whatever call rates generate controller

00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:17,940
welcome index which means rails okey

00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:22,150
rails generate me in controller with

00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,900
that is called welcome with one function

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,900
called index

00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:52,070
don't wash cold okay you need because

00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:58,400
for a proposed change understand what

00:52:52,070 --> 00:53:01,750
support and studying instrument is

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,750
pocket with supporting stallion

00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:12,089
equals

00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:28,320
 my 86 a min escape over the Sailor

00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,320
Moon only 270 and I was the prime

00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:38,529
I mean this is luis emphasis

00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:54,729
not my judo zipper ha

00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,760
yes II

00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,760
search

00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:35,720
sick on a c++ SAH see it succeed we must

00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:38,590
see pasta made with no consumer broken

00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,590
something in store

00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:06,839
who has generated a controller

00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:12,259
successfully one two three four five we

00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:17,779
don't so you can see it from the output

00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:22,499
what it has done it added to route it

00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:26,309
added some files and directories and

00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:29,819
there is a test file it copy over edit

00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:31,469
some assets stuff like that so again you

00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:33,930
don't have to do anything you just have

00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:39,529
to call the command and it does

00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:39,529
everything for you so what does that do

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:50,160
one of the things that has done is

00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:58,229
created this file apps use welcome index

00:55:50,160 --> 00:56:11,119
HTML 30lb open it look into it simple

00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:11,119
HTML form d murder

00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,970
ya buggers and storms

00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:41,319
okay so you see it's simple HTML change

00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:47,890
it to something else like hello world

00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:53,969
for instance so the burette something

00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:53,969
else an image or other text or whatever

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:20,600
Robert stern what have you done

00:57:24,539 --> 00:57:31,039
another time now I need sequel life

00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:48,280
you can also know this is when you do

00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,280
with you my appt yeah

00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,839
come on

00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:14,869
really extended stay internet no problem

00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:59,099
everybody has changed something in the

00:58:23,220 --> 00:59:02,329
HTML file looks good so change the HTML

00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:02,329
to something

00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:14,680
yeah it's also cool editor ok so once

00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:22,469
you have changed the HTML to something

00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:28,200
else you can go to this URL so the same

00:59:22,469 --> 00:59:28,200
thing again / welcome / index

00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:46,820
looks good and you can go through and

00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,820
the browser to

00:59:52,960 --> 01:00:03,920
and now you in the same directory either

00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:06,309
read or generate controller welcome

01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,309
index

01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:23,830
so go to your app / welcome / index and

01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,100
you should see your changes in the HTML

01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,100
file

01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,140
you listen

01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:51,789
do you see it changes so change change

01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:56,670
it again to something else and reload

01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:56,670
and you see it will instantly show up

01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:17,110
sorry yeah

01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,600
that's some nice feature for about rares

01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:23,830
if you call it with red server it will

01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:27,130
start up the local web server and we'll

01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:42,300
watch the files or changes and this

01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:42,300
great aim automatically so you have done

01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:57,390
you first view in rates and you first

01:01:49,060 --> 01:02:02,550
controller so do you notice something

01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:02,550
why do you think it's / welcome / index

01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:26,800
why isn't it / index or / whatever

01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:31,270
because in rails apps you the standard

01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:35,880
way to call something is by controller

01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:40,930
name welcome and then functioning index

01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:43,810
so it will go in to the if your browser

01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:48,540
requests that page it will go into the

01:02:43,810 --> 01:02:52,150
file app controllers welcome controller

01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:57,580
30lb you can look at it it's an app

01:02:52,150 --> 01:03:05,860
controllers the file you look at it with

01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:11,350
your editor you and you see if you open

01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:19,170
the file it's very basic there's nothing

01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:19,170
in there really it all right

01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:31,850
just some standard definition so this is

01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:36,710
where most of the work in rails apps

01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:38,720
happen in the controller because it sits

01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:41,180
in the middle right it receives the

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,720
input from the browser so from the user

01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:49,550
and then it might ask the database for

01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:52,430
for for stuff and push that to the view

01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:55,160
which you see them in your browser this

01:03:52,430 --> 01:04:10,480
is the usual way how how it goes in

01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:10,480
rails so countries if you call it twice

01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,420
alright

01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,220
you

01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:25,730
no it looks like you have created it

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:34,900
already can you look into the apps

01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:34,900
territory AP p

01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:43,460
controller such as another subtractive

01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,460
controllers

01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:50,800
just go into the cold

01:04:52,970 --> 01:05:01,660
you already have it you open it with vio

01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:22,359
so it should work

01:05:07,869 --> 01:05:30,519
yes called twice ok so there's another

01:05:22,359 --> 01:05:33,670
proud of rails because right if you if

01:05:30,519 --> 01:05:36,809
you would have done some sensible stuff

01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:40,119
and not just outputting some random HTML

01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:43,890
and we do more controllers and stuff

01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:49,779
like that you would end up always with

01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:53,200
these controller name function doesn't

01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:58,589
really really work for web app right you

01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:05,279
need you need to have root page so in

01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:09,190
index page and for that another

01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:15,180
important file for rails is the routes

01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:15,180
file you can open it in your editor

01:06:26,589 --> 01:06:40,989
you see it so it's in the config

01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:44,349
subdirectory called roots are be when

01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:49,029
you have called the way it's generate to

01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:51,910
generate the controller it has added

01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:54,960
something to the file what do you think

01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:54,960
it has added

01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:07,830
yes

01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:15,060
so what do you think have asked your

01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:27,210
rails generate call and it to control

01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:29,450
air to the roots I'll tell me no it has

01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:34,980
added on the second line to sketch

01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:47,250
welcome / index get this the standard

01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:53,520
way of of HTTP to get something so now

01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:58,770
we can trick rails introducing that is

01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:01,980
our root page and as you can see a few

01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:05,700
lines down there's a commented line with

01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:12,440
root welcome index if you uncomment that

01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:18,930
and save the file and just go through to

01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:23,370
the root of your web app so zero point

01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:28,650
zero point zero zero colon 3000 you

01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:34,190
should see your welcome index page so

01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:34,190
that one was out the part at the end

01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:09,900
so that's that work for everybody okay

01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:23,790
so now the tricky part for you wants to

01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,790
explain to me what we just did

01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,119
not you

01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:48,210
and maybe what is missing what didn't we

01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:51,870
do remember we have models with with

01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:55,200
which guard the database controllers

01:09:51,870 --> 01:09:58,140
which take input and give it back to

01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:03,990
views and they showed which part didn't

01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:07,430
we use we didn't we don't have any data

01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:10,290
yet we are just taking input and

01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:12,690
outputting HTML we could have done the

01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:16,950
same with a simple HTML file in point of

01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:21,090
the browser to it so now comes the

01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:22,890
interesting part right because at the

01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:26,670
beginning I explained to you that web

01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:29,100
apps are data and manipulation of it and

01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:37,970
displaying it right but we don't have

01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:37,970
any data yet so we need to add data and

01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:47,930
for that you also have a nice race

01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:53,180
command which helps lose doing that so

01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:58,110
you can call rails generate scaffold i

01:10:53,180 --> 01:11:02,730
use post because maybe you're abyssal

01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:05,700
block so we have posts and they have

01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:08,720
title which is a string and the body

01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,720
which is a text

01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:35,820
so generate that rates 1.9 quick

01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:38,850
hmm what no it's not that bad they have

01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:46,650
to use to attach always the numbers to

01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:51,750
the commands so once you call it you see

01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:54,900
it has done a lot of things and that is

01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:57,480
called scaffolding it has created the

01:11:54,900 --> 01:12:02,610
controller the views a touch the root

01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:04,679
files that added a model tests all that

01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:08,449
stuff way more than the rest generate

01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,449
controller method did

01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:19,150
so how do you think you can access that

01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:39,880
so look at your roots I'll configure

01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:39,880
oops you know config roots RB config

01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:53,260
look at the file just yeah with your

01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:53,260
who's your editor awesome so

01:12:53,470 --> 01:13:02,320
how do you think you can view a post the

01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:06,570
scaffolding already did everything for

01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:16,620
you that's the convention part you just

01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:24,310
create a standard ruby-on-rails web app

01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:27,180
scaffolding for posts so how do you

01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:30,250
think you can view that in your browser

01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:35,340
figure that out look into the app

01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:35,340
directory remember what we did before

01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:51,469
show me the or you already have it

01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:51,469
that's good no you don't have it yes

01:13:51,830 --> 01:14:04,220
so what do you see when you open your

01:13:55,370 --> 01:14:09,320
web app and try to exit it enero why do

01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:13,430
you think that is why you see the error

01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:17,290
in your app I'm you'd say swipe is there

01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:17,290
but why you think it is there

01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:42,090
why is that an error when you display or

01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:47,070
when you access your app no idea right

01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:50,070
no database because that is something

01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:53,460
that rates only touches when you tell it

01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:56,070
to because the database is very

01:14:53,460 --> 01:15:00,210
important it holds your data right it's

01:14:56,070 --> 01:15:05,760
what your app is all about and it only

01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:07,590
touches that if you tell it to so if you

01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:14,040
look at the error message it already

01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:17,850
says what you need to do so you need to

01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:24,570
run the migration which is another nice

01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:26,430
feature of rails you don't really have

01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:29,430
to care take care of the database

01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:31,920
yourself Reyes does that for you only if

01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:36,780
you tell it to but it does that for you

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:40,320
so you can do the way wake give you my

01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:44,340
grade and it will set up the database

01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:49,770
and fill it with the with the table with

01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:55,590
the right setting so you you never have

01:15:49,770 --> 01:16:04,500
to really do database design by hand you

01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:07,620
can just use rails for that freshman

01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:14,630
which database do you think it uses some

01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:21,850
magic one in the internet sorry

01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:21,850
so yes so where is it to your database

01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:32,060
what do you think raise your database

01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:41,870
sqlite database of just files where do

01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:45,800
you think your files so no solve he has

01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:55,960
it knows where it is where do you think

01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:55,960
is your database look for do you have it

01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:08,390
there is a DB for door right there is

01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:19,730
your database it's just a simple sqlite

01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:24,700
file okay so remember that one we have a

01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:29,630
welcome controller with a function index

01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:32,450
right and when we go to that URL it

01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:37,850
outputs the stuff that we have put in

01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:41,540
the in the index.html file how do you

01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:46,460
think you can access your posts we

01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:53,350
haven't any output which URL do you have

01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:53,350
to go to so

01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:59,800
try okay

01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,700
this

01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:26,610
so where do you think you have to go to

01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:29,640
posts / posts the index one is the

01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:32,540
standard want to run the standard

01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:35,280
function so you just have to go to posts

01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:38,430
what else is there in the posts

01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,890
controller what else could you do and we

01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:43,740
if you if this would be our blog and we

01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:48,410
would have posed with the title and the

01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:48,410
body what else can there be

01:19:01,749 --> 01:19:09,629
so look into the looking through the

01:19:04,889 --> 01:19:09,629
controller into the post controller

01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:30,360
Oh to run the reg TV my great

01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,940
what can you do

01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,440
so this will set up the database

01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:05,260
so it's an app controllers

01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:34,870
oh you haven't my up direct me and I

01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:34,870
have my girl she will go to City up

01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:52,020
so look into your post control what else

01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:56,040
is in there there are a lot of functions

01:20:52,020 --> 01:21:00,650
in there not only index which lists all

01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:00,650
the Pope but what is what else is there

01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:17,430
nobody keralite you create delete right

01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:27,300
so however you think you can add a new

01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:30,110
post if you want to view in your app the

01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:39,510
function new in your post controller

01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:42,510
remember that one so it's simply post /

01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:45,210
new if you go that they're in your

01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:54,560
browser you will get a form that will

01:21:45,210 --> 01:22:00,900
let you enter post so you can enter it

01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:03,140
enter a title a nice body and if you

01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,140
save that

01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:21,550
read it doesn't go afterwards

01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:36,730
if you add a post it shows you the post

01:22:33,429 --> 01:22:41,530
it's just an / post if it's the first

01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:44,619
one you've added its / call fresh one if

01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:50,070
it's the third one that would be / posts

01:22:44,619 --> 01:22:50,070
/ 3 right

01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:09,430
so now you have a real web app here's

01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:14,680
data in your database with the post with

01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:20,590
the title and and the body and you can

01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:27,250
add new course you can delete them you

01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:29,650
can edit them stuff like that so if you

01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:32,140
add a little bit of CSS and maybe some

01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:40,150
javis JavaScript you have a flock

01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:45,130
application and this is remember we

01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:48,460
really only use three or four commands

01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:51,400
and you already have a block I know it's

01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:55,480
very basic and it doesn't look like much

01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:58,750
and it doesn't have logins and blah blah

01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:06,940
blah but this is the basic stuff right

01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:11,380
so in one and a half hours you have gone

01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:18,000
from nothing to a simple block and this

01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:21,730
is what else does it makes you

01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,830
productive because now you can add stuff

01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:27,310
you can think about okay I have posts

01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:31,270
and listenings how for instance can i

01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:34,360
display them at my front page lists all

01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:41,020
my posts we have done that already with

01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:44,520
the Welcome controller so try it do you

01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:48,670
remember how you change the front page

01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:52,510
yes gone into the config routes file and

01:24:48,670 --> 01:25:00,330
there's a route setting if you no say in

01:24:52,510 --> 01:25:03,880
that file not route welcome index but

01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:06,840
route toasts index it will list all your

01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,840
posts on the front page

01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:17,429
she call you app no

01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:25,120
overlooked

01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:30,489
no yeah

01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:43,150
so now you already have your posts on

01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:48,110
your front page and basically this is

01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:51,050
you can replace very complex blocks like

01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:54,950
wordpress or whatever with that right

01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:59,450
you had a little bit of CSS maybe add a

01:25:54,950 --> 01:26:02,690
login system stuff like that and you

01:25:59,450 --> 01:26:04,820
have a block and all the web apps the

01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:08,900
cool web apps you know that are out

01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:11,540
there are nothing more than that they

01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:14,840
have a database where stuff is in they

01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:21,650
display it and allow you to to change

01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:28,330
the data so Twitter Facebook all the

01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:31,330
stuff like that are just basic web apps

01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:31,330
right

01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:46,650
sorry so oh I use sublime text which

01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:55,220
sublime text which is a commercial

01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:55,220
controller but I used to use VI so

01:26:56,059 --> 01:27:02,039
no not well there's you can download it

01:27:00,389 --> 01:27:05,550
but there's no package but you can

01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:07,880
download it in so you can run it up

01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,880
mimics

01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,570
yes

01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:33,250
yes so so far what we have done we have

01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:35,889
no access control if you put that out

01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:39,040
there somewhere everybody can add post

01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:45,369
delete them change them because there's

01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:49,780
no no yeah no access control you have no

01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:53,679
users so but this is still this is just

01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:58,290
stuff like that right you could generate

01:27:53,679 --> 01:28:02,980
a scaffold with user and then have a

01:27:58,290 --> 01:28:06,940
name and maybe a description and then

01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:10,290
you have F can have users in your app

01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:14,889
then you can you know build from there

01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:23,409
axis system or you can which is what

01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:24,849
everybody else does it's using gems so

01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:29,320
you don't have to do everything yourself

01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:31,809
there so there are a lot of gems for for

01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:36,179
instance for access control if you go to

01:28:31,809 --> 01:28:45,309
ruby gem stock and search maybe 44

01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:47,800
device so te vi se4 can can see AMC am

01:28:45,309 --> 01:28:52,719
they are rubygems you would just add

01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:57,480
them to your gemfile bundle install and

01:28:52,719 --> 01:29:03,599
have all the functionality they bring so

01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,599
this is how you do basic web apps

01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:10,110
and that is what rates it's all about so

01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:13,680
as you can see the philosophy is sketch

01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:17,400
it done in one and a half hour you have

01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:21,540
a very I mean very basic but the blog

01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:25,800
application I dare you to do that in any

01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:32,820
other framework that is out there it

01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:35,990
won't be that easy and then faster cool

01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:35,990
any other questions

01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:56,660
that you can do a lot of things you can

01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:58,820
there are hosting sites for Ruby

01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:01,070
applications where you can just upload

01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:04,490
your application when they do the

01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:07,640
hosting one-on-one the most famous one

01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:10,010
is here working here whoo cool which is

01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:12,950
where you just push your source code and

01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:16,520
they run the app for you or you can use

01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:19,280
your own apache server there's a there's

01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:26,840
a ruby gem called passenger which is for

01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:32,120
Apache to run your stuff and there are

01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:36,370
other possibilities like the redhead

01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:40,870
stuff Forrester yeah

01:30:36,370 --> 01:30:40,870
