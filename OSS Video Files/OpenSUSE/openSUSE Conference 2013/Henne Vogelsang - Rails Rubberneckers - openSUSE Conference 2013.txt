Title: Henne Vogelsang - Rails Rubberneckers - openSUSE Conference 2013
Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	This is a get-together of people who don't want to take their first steps Ruby on Rails alone. Are you already familiar with a scripting language such as the Ps (python/perl/php) or even ruby? Are you fascinated by today's web-apps and APIs? Why don't you swing by, mingle and get started together with other rubberneckers on Ruby on Rails, the open source web-framework optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. This workshop requires no special knowledge, we will use the web browser and the command line to go through it. Bring your laptop, preferably with openSUSE 12.3 installed!
