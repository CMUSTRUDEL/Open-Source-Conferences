Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	WMKIT is an open hardware microcontroller based educational kit created with the overall goal of having fun. Beyond this, the aim is to get you comfortable using a wide range of electronic components through small, simple and easy circuits. The focus is to get each circuit working then giving you the tools to figure out why.
The kit started as an idea in Tiranas Open Labs hackerspace, the only hacperspace for the moment in the country.

good evening first of all it's quite I'd

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,269
like to say that it's quite awesome to

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,449
be here it was for us it was an amazing

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,369
weekend and congrats to the to all the

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,619
people that are that did this volunteers

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:28,289
organizing team they've done a great job

00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:31,980
my name is Jordan I came from I come

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,130
from Albania and today we are going to

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,200
talk about not operating systems but

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,480
more about electronics that are based on

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,250
opens open systems and open hardware and

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,020
the first part of the presentation is

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,760
going to be more about how the whole

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,190
project started and how we decided to go

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,620
through it and the second part the

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,329
second part will would be presented by

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,760
my colleague and friend Luca that it's

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:08,479
going to be more let's say technical and

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,729
in details so Albania no no welding is

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,890
clutter in case you might know at least

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,270
but I'm probably sure that some of you

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,119
do not know that it has a very weird

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:25,409
future for the 90s it was one of the

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,259
let's say most hard dictatorships out

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:33,090
there and we were very close to it

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,390
obvious totes to be in the communities

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,009
we were forced to be part of communities

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,250
which sounds like a good thing being

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,710
said at an open sue circumference but

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,320
it's not that fun leave me so that nice

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,240
big Switzerland became poz it the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,540
majority adjusts which is not good thing

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:57,240
to want to do any plated with community

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:59,640
projects by the way these are these are

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,350
bunkers spread around Albania into what

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,450
it's for me it's one of the most

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,430
fascinating things we have there

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,679
although it's kind of a negative and

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,860
it's were related I was not born time

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:18,480
but now he's Kotov are

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,750
Bay's there and because Tirana is very

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,190
close from here I and my all of my

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,310
friends that have been there they are

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,040
quite like let's say had the change

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,410
their opinion about the city if you

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,480
haven't been there I would I would

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,870
definitely say to you to go there and

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,700
Jonna is the place where we are based

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,360
open space des mille we're going to talk

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:47,600
about email Jeremic strictly Tirana has

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,640
no has had only a few activities about

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,320
openly they were not organized in a

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,390
certain and specific way just like we

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,770
did here like this weekend and these

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,150
five days not organized in terms of

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,910
events in terms of getting together with

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,840
people and doing that in a certain and

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,459
specific way during during the year I

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,430
wouldn't say that it was any community

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:18,720
and I don't know if it's now but we are

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:20,610
working on that so in this city in this

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,830
country in this city where no there was

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:27,540
no association or a community about open

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,670
knowledge before we decided to get

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,459
together a group of friends that had the

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,190
same vision and this wisdom vision was

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,549
that we want to share knowledge through

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:41,940
technology the primer the first idea was

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,890
to share knowledge and technology as you

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,930
might know better than me make its

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,820
indecent activity makes it easier share

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,380
share through through only not only

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:57,560
through in a city but also at the world

00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:04,530
and we started as a as a hackerspace

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:08,220
because we we thought that the physical

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,680
space is the the best way to gather

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,610
these people together one of the

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,700
problems we thought was that there was

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,380
there was no community before because

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,289
and all the attempt attempts to do so

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,900
where we had some somehow failed because

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:28,010
they're there they were lacking of

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:33,930
physical space to get together do hacks

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:37,140
make projects and collaborate so our

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,330
activities are mainly based on not on a

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,800
specific thing but in general about with

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,560
like we talked about we've done a lot of

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,520
events about linux in general not a

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,580
specific distro we worked with you know

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,960
doing workshop about wordpress and this

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,890
was very interesting because lots of

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,700
people were into wanted to know a

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,490
platform or way to make their own

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,400
website of course Wikipedia an Albanian

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,130
it's it's very poor it's I know

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,190
Wikipedia in Greek I've used it a lot

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,260
and believe me it's the del bene version

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,610
is very very poor at the moment so it's

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:17,360
there is a gap there that needs to be to

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,790
be closed in the in the near future and

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,920
yeah you know programming you know

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,390
everybody not everybody but the majority

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,660
of the people that come to apple apps

00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,630
loves it love it Mozilla christus is

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,830
Krista are you here no he's not here so

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:37,020
Mozilla is one of the things we began

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,090
inspiration zillow projects we got

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,590
inspiration working on them from the

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,570
Greek community because we were exposed

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,590
to what they were doing at the time and

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:52,950
they are good doing a great job and you

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,380
know lots of people have say I heard

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,000
yesterday during a presentation that the

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,530
first thing you had to do if you want to

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,380
get involved in one of the projects that

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:04,050
we are in into or distros is to get log

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,560
led to make localization and we started

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,020
doing some some let's say transit

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,480
subtitles and this was the first step on

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,490
getting people on board on working on

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,070
translations and localization so we

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,720
started working on on TED talks with

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:25,430
subtitles and it this was very very very

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:29,880
very positive start in the beginning as

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,910
I said in order to make to do a

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,440
community we thought that the physical

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,020
space is one of the most important

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,910
elements that we had if you see these

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,890
one of the pictures if you see every

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,249
element element in a crisis its old

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,199
place

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:45,929
had now we are all wearing a new place

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,059
but this was the old place if you can

00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:49,949
see everything it's pretty DIY and

00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,599
create from scratch if you are getting

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,099
increasingly actually you know they run

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,979
in a very well but and that's the same

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:59,879
pass so this place people like

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:03,689
projections talks gatherings workshops

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:07,139
if somebody some some of us know

00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:09,659
something about C++ we create a he

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,269
creative workshops workshop he presented

00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:14,939
to the other people and somebody else if

00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:18,029
you know how to install a boon to or

00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,009
openSUSE installation distro to somebody

00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,649
you you make an event pretty easy and

00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,289
the thing keeps going so we started in

00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:30,119
july in the last line we had a very big

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:32,309
celebration the week before and you know

00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:35,759
this kind of situation the good thing is

00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:38,009
that produce is projects and not

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,509
projects in the bay area if you because

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,279
we are in the beginning we are not

00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:44,909
talking about projects that are well

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,989
structured structured in the way that

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:51,839
for example opensuse like we are just

00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:53,909
work with these kind of projects we have

00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:59,879
hardware their wheel of hardware a lot

00:07:53,909 --> 00:08:01,889
and we take for example the indy here

00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,669
you can see this is a 3d scanner using a

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:10,529
connect from you know the mighty xbox

00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:13,739
microsoft xbox playing machine so i

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:17,849
think luke i bought that into into the

00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:23,279
space and it way we took the to the kids

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:25,319
several weeks to to do that and yeah

00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,049
this is the internal of the place as you

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,069
can see these guys these are teenagers

00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:35,339
and i feel the negative part of it is

00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:39,329
that I feel pretty pretty old when I see

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:42,089
because the number the age is around 20

00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:43,979
or 20 something early 20s the majority

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,399
of the people there are very are being

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,579
exposed to these kind of situations for

00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,720
the first time and this is one of the

00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:55,350
things we are very very proud of it

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,210
about so this we are working that we

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,980
lots of cables and hardware and you know

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,290
we have missed me has been first 3d

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,050
printing services 18 facility rafi no

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,910
baby yet we did not practice from

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:15,240
scratch again and make it work and as I

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:16,980
said Connect is a big al as Angelo we

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,440
had not project that structure would

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,590
start when we're in a community we were

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,210
doing almost everything like a real an

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,470
idea for example a tux know how to make

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:29,100
some time off I remember he's

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,780
progressing spiders free pizza it's ever

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,420
it's gonna be like it was easy him to

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,280
work on and share he's not with us this

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,110
was the structure but until this event

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,770
this was the first event in kosovo in

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,120
pune that they called they emailed us

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,250
and say hey do you want to make a

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,660
presentation about your project the

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,490
problem with us was that we didn't had

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,900
any project a specific project bishop we

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,850
could say like possible that we remain

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,460
with reason that we effective only four

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,870
things three or mastership there and we

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,880
had two weeks more than let's do we

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,260
present of course we answer that them we

00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,820
have project it's all here to learn

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,530
after that we're doing is I put we are

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,620
good so you need to find something now

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,380
and that was how it's done of the the

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,530
most piece of hardware that the Assad

00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:14,610
ladies Arduino and Luca started saying

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:17,340
that we could actually do something with

00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,290
it because it's it's something that you

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,110
could do lots of project with projects

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,600
with and I think you could say faster

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:29,940
and better story than me about how we we

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:32,160
got organized on working with that so

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,600
what is arguing a Luca yeah first of all

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,330
thank you were done because this time

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,970
you took only 12 minutes last time was

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,960
45 minutes and you were planning for 10

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:46,320
minutes okay arduino we were thinking to

00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,720
use ready hardware that maybe in future

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,450
will be developed in a better or like

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,130
different situation are doing it's a

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,870
single-board microcontroller i don't

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,970
know if you know it but it's a quite

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,700
cool and handsome device allows you to

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,420
put very simple secrets i mean to create

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,160
simple secrets and allows you to help

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,910
people that it don't know at all

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,700
electronics

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,170
to make different type of projects that

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,150
we're even lose the frontiers up in

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,650
seconds and quite easy to use it takes

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,990
like no me in our workshops when we

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,960
start people without any knowledge of

00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,720
electronics or only with some basic know

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,100
how of like wins resources bonus two

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,890
hours to get ready to make the first

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:33,080
experiments starting from this idea with

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:36,600
wrote a quirky calc allows us to plan

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,610
was a cool fun and so what you said we'd

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,760
rather know k the idea was already from

00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:44,070
some time in in our brain saying OK in

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,520
our mind okay maybe let's see I don't

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,570
know Wade occasion with the FSK right

00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,750
okay because nothing maybe public

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,500
entities the cross country and we try

00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,480
create a thing is affected to be a again

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,910
okay are doing your brand name is a

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,450
chipset HTML that is one of the

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,850
different microcontrollers on what we

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,960
started for these from these electronics

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,160
and radical orientation so they might

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,900
controller it's using the same

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,870
technology of property what's a

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,890
different rate is naked share your fan

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,890
the website is we make it the CEO it's a

00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,140
as I mentioned before it's a full

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:32,000
package that allows the people to

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,200
somebody it's using open our door

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,690
windows laptop who makes private branch

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,180
open go ahead particular keep you take

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:43,080
over to text itself to go in the schools

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,030
now the teachers the professor's to make

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,580
the students to play with something that

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,560
is not only on a screen that is very

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,560
nice it's very interesting but is not

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,140
involving the people so much with a kid

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,440
with some electronics playing with

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,150
electronics you can involve the people

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,880
much more i mean i remember first time

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,970
read on that is not really a electronic

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,220
guy or even a programmer guy didn't know

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,590
anything about electronics and in half

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,090
an hour one hour more or less started to

00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:16,650
be able to use something and to do

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:20,930
something its total nano as regular

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,010
general buys session on okay prospecting

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,540
mph

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,120
one is not an input but doesn't matter

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,640
it's in any case it's a sensor and a

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,950
little dribbler you can interact but

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,740
only with the software itself you can

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,030
make a queuing system you can make we

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,800
can make firefox you can make whatever

00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,240
you want but you're not touching what

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,100
you are doing you see Tony on the screen

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,800
with that type of the best being put

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,390
into the advice given and what is pretty

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,620
busy that you can really in few days of

00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,140
playing with your own insert paper come

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,360
to see I gotta get that you can do it

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,220
exactly type oolitic cosmic like

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,590
something siblings after you go with two

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,380
after poetry and after we go with really

00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,780
different you can like for example from

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,660
that simple one you can go to control

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,150
for example as more engine small step /

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,370
is a particle device you can for example

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,440
starting for the simpler the go to an

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,670
LCD screen and then quickly the LCD

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,990
screen without knowing equals what

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,360
happening so you can say ok to me how's

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,670
it work and starting simple experiment

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,880
you can grow up and grow up to make the

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,530
full management of an LCD screen LCD

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,120
screen is a normal screen that you have

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,600
on your computer the main difference

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:34,010
that ok not only the technology is that

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,840
is behind but also mainly the number of

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,880
pixels that you can manage so you have

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,060
different type of technology you can use

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,960
to manage the pixels and you can use it

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:49,210
you can do it with a kid ok the kid is

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:53,270
we were mentioning is made in Albania is

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:55,340
like a sort of our red velvet or

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,240
development of the electronics that we

00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:03,770
go in the interim ok and we put all

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,590
together these things in our lab think

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,990
that this kit itself is something that

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,120
we were thinking also not only to

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,840
present it in these in that conference

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,320
but also to create something that a lot

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,840
of the echo space being self sustainable

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,690
I don't know if you were ever working in

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,370
a or playing in a mega space but the

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,740
main problem that you can have the key

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:32,270
web in our naked space is to find the

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,370
money to keep up going the echo space

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,690
equitable it's more or less one year

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,330
that we have to find to make it

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,760
sustainable it's not at all easy this

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:45,950
one was one of the tools that we taught

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:49,250
to 12 8 a's help for the echo space to

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:51,230
be sustainable okay this one are the

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,300
boss's office with the result p this one

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,900
is pertinently for the components that

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,870
we wear for the four kids we have some

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:03,920
bread balls some speakers and so on okay

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,320
this one is I think the success led by

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,730
the way we had several workshops in the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Balkan one in Germany with red on this

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,450
one was done in Kosovo cassava and was

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,030
done in one day and we had two workshops

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,670
and we had to classroom like these on

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,880
that you can see full of people we had

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,940
10 kids we presented to to these people

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,800
without any knowledge of electronics or

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,850
ok they were studying electronics but

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,960
that's another issue or with very basic

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,910
IT skills regarding the programming we

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,640
we cannot see there but we had also two

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,880
or three professors from Christina and

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,120
the world this week was not very easy we

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,860
were like to play chicken with from

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,830
Esther exempt by the way I don't know

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,410
here in Greece but I can tell you in

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,420
albania in macedonia in Kosova and i

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,970
think also in other countries to have

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,400
this type of tools to play with them in

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,180
busy at school or at least at the

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:12,220
universities why because normally this

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:15,140
type of electronics is quite expensive

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,630
Norman a sunbed across Japan cost to the

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:21,020
school like or to the University like

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,450
200 or 300 a row and which one you can't

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:28,180
really play quite easily with the very

00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:35,260
few quid few minutes from Crete this one

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:41,630
right okay or okay we make it is 3500

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:43,310
it's quite cheap as as kit as like a 10

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,080
hour that allows the different

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,070
organizations that are promoting or

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,610
supporting this key

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,160
it to make a small revenue to make them

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,150
self sustainable or trying to help them

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,330
to make self-sustainable its young a

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,880
different source tool that software that

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,130
are also multi-platform we data we

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,470
cannot afford to grow with software or

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,630
with tools that are simple batemans not

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,280
what we don't let go to once a lot of

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:14,390
enterprises that we can use are also

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:17,660
different type of platform and we

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,760
decided to use the most user tools that

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,820
are this moment in the market that are

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,280
they arduino either I da and the

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,230
Fritzing that are the tools that at this

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,430
moment are allowing us to manage the

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:35,120
documentation the website not only

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:39,220
because it's both of the object itself

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,560
that allow us to develop all the like

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:45,470
prototyping of the of the experiment sir

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,910
allow us to port 80 so the schema mlx

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:54,740
aunty Wyn today ed and so on by the way

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:57,050
all these electronics was in our mind to

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,540
be used with what you saw before what

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:02,840
was presenting before Adan with a 3d

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,170
scanner and 3d printing because we

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,720
believe that it's a full cycle that you

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:12,320
have an idea you want to prototype the

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,750
idea like with printing out a physical

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,900
device you want to make some electronics

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,850
or you want for example starting from a

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,480
physical device make a 3d scanner of the

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,570
device and after start again all do all

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,860
these things we are naked space so we

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,660
are playing with this issue we are

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,220
playing with the open Technology open

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,600
source but also we are playing with the

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,600
physical things

00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:48,970
okay a few few seconds hope that it was

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:51,460
not too boring as we mentioned that we

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:55,450
are playing with electronics this one is

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,700
the new like prototype of the new board

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,800
that you are developing why we are

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,420
developing this type of board that maybe

00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,180
you can say it's quite stupid because

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,330
you are using a daughter board for the

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,670
main confer the main board because we

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,580
are believing that if you go to the

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,950
schools and to the students you can make

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,010
them to play much more understand much

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,960
more the electronics in the programming

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:24,240
this one is done by one of the member of

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,180
the open labs as a volunteer is

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,400
developing all day old electronics by

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,910
the way at this moment akita it's made

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,120
with base as a base version that is with

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:39,610
25 experiments that allows to start from

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:45,580
without any knowledge to being more

00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:49,150
active with different components we

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,320
having plan as a plan to develop two

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:58,690
additional kids all of them we want to

00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:00,340
construct them in our acre space we will

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,130
have an advantage kit with additional

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,370
experiments and we will have also a

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,470
robotics kit where for example the

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,470
physical components of the robots that

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,870
we want to put the devices of the robots

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,390
that we want to put inside the kit we

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:21,790
want to develop them and to physical

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:23,800
construct them within the echo space we

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,950
add the summation before a different

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,830
presentation all around in the balcony

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,630
we will have in Rome and quite happy

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,580
thanks to read on that is pushing to go

00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,980
there also because we came here to make

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,170
this presentation we were not able to

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,940
make here like a workshop at least we

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,100
add all the components but we were not

00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,310
able to in 30 minutes is quite sure to

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,060
do it but will be from the third to the

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,560
sixth of october2013 in rome if you want

00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,990
to come you're really welcome it's a

00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,309
really interesting

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,260
event for the people that are making

00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:57,240
stuff that they are makers that they are

00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,760
playing with the physical stuff not only

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,400
with the software and we will have a

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,210
workshop or okay a workshop and a

00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,220
presentation and we will show the people

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,160
i mean what we are doing in the balcony

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,710
that we are not need an area of the

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,320
world but we have people that they want

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:25,620
to do something we have young people

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:28,920
that they want to create additional

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:33,059
value added value we believe that this

00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:41,880
type of people they're our future thank

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:47,160
you before there do we have time for

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:49,620
questions okay just to add something we

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:54,150
had a question from the Mozilla guys I

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:57,200
think from Cypress or not about how to

00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:02,100
fund how to have a hackerspace

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:06,240
self-sustainable this is one way and one

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:10,590
way road means that if you have if you

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:14,550
use open technologies there is they can

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:17,100
be models that can bring you back and

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,600
make it sustainable and this without of

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,400
this you can think of something else

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,070
this is hardware you can think of

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,110
software but if everything is open I

00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:28,860
think there is a bright future there too

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:31,170
to have to have new a new ecosystem that

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,450
is self sustainable through

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:39,960
collaboration and openness so if you

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:41,990
have any question questions that's not

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,990
good

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:53,739
if you go to we make that CEO there is

00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:55,209
the manual and on the menu and there is

00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:58,209
there are all the components that the

00:23:55,209 --> 00:24:01,509
kid-kit has the idea we have chosen

00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:03,609
elements that make it easier for people

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:07,269
that are like just started playing

00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:12,899
around with it to make lots of like more

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:12,899
than 30 to 35 experiments that we have

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,399
at this moment we have 25 experiences

00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:20,649
but these exponents are done by us there

00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,849
are no there can be additional

00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:24,759
experience that you can do and

00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:27,669
everything is limited to your let's say

00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:30,669
I have fantasy of doing having an idea

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:33,879
and implementing it for example like in

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:37,479
the workshop we had a in Berlin there

00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:39,729
was like some crazy ideas that we

00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:42,399
haven't placed them yet in the website

00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:44,829
but like whatever you think of you can

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,139
do it with this kind of kid but the good

00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:50,200
the good thing is that you can add and

00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:52,959
by and get more additional materials and

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,479
create yourself everything you can we

00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:58,239
make that Co manual is there is

00:24:55,479 --> 00:25:07,299
everything out there did we mention it

00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:09,729
costs it costs 25 euros 25 to us and 10

00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:12,249
euros go back to the project so no like

00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:16,359
there is no nobody personally winning

00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:19,479
out of this as I said this is one of the

00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,099
ways you can get funding for your hacker

00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:27,279
space but I think there is a combination

00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:35,879
of ways any other questions easy please

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:35,879
not up here here and there

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:46,280
right its own so you said you you made a

00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:49,260
3d scanner and you bought a 3d printer

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:54,660
did you ever manage to scan an object

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:58,200
and then recreate it not yet sorry I

00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,690
don't know not yet like we weave believe

00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,350
it or not like we have only one here on

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,480
doing these things and I think we are

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,690
just we have just started learning

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,990
ourselves how to do things so even the

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:15,090
3d scanner that you saw its for for kids

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:27,360
that are today that age is quite let's

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:30,720
say complicated but are different people

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,670
that have learning doing mistakes so we

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,160
are not afraid of doing mistakes we

00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,110
encourage the people to make mistakes so

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,110
is the only way that we we believe that

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:43,020
these young people they can understand I

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,910
mean how something is working by the way

00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,670
one of the biggest problems that we have

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,150
in the balcony at least in Albania and

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:54,030
also i know in kosovo kosova sorry is

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,940
that the components some specific

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,309
components are not at all easy to do to

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,860
be purchased you can buy abroad but

00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:05,450
sometime you cannot you are not able to

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:09,360
receive them in your country for example

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,260
we had the 3d printer the 3d printer is

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,450
we purchased it but I was with the guy

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,460
that sold me the 3d printer that I build

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,429
up completely from scratch is a

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:22,230
do-it-yourself 3d printer using the same

00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:24,090
components or I mean the same

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,900
electronics that we have in the with

00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:30,540
indicator and for example it happened

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,570
that we were block it for like six

00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,330
months four months because like some

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,670
components they were not working we

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:41,130
burned out the electronics by mistake as

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,590
usual that's such a good thing when yeah

00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,140
because we understood that we don't have

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,070
to pay in some way and we had to wait

00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,080
like

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,029
one month enough to get the main board

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,179
of day of the electron acceptor day for

00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:55,500
the 3d printer after we discovered that

00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,779
some other stuff they were not working

00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,059
so we had to wait and to try to fix them

00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:02,580
more or less now the 3d printer its

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:05,399
printing we have to fix some small

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,250
details but one of the lesson that we

00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:09,929
got from these advanced technology

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,509
because in any case seems stupid

00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:15,299
technology but is quite advanced within

00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:17,279
the application of the technology is you

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,620
have to buy at least two times the

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,049
components that you need because you are

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,269
burning them because maybe you are like

00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:27,120
screwing up some some small details that

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:30,179
are allowing you not to make the the

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,649
device working and and so on the same

00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:37,200
for the 3d scanner at this moment it's a

00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:41,429
completely all made the product or like

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,190
yeah product idea these guys that you

00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:46,830
saw in the picture the world 16 18 years

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,990
old they were playing with it our I was

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,610
only pushing them to to do something and

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:55,799
to 12 on making mistakes getting them

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:59,100
concentrated it's not yeah the easiest

00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:01,379
part of the story by the way so yeah the

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,700
I don't do you have a hackerspace into

00:29:01,379 --> 00:29:12,590
some degree and do one get an open one

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,590
what I cannot hear you

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:27,140
hello I've heard that they're starting

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:31,820
one in an area called boat sorry is it

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:35,960
around here there it's about 15 minutes

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,940
maximum by bus okay it's near the center

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,400
but no there's no that higher spacing

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,000
facella make you but there's 13 11 tip

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,730
about this kind of things I don't know

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,230
how is it like how people react in

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,660
different cities but for example in

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,040
Tirana if you're hiker space is not in

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,300
the center or like quite in the center

00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,510
it's going to be hard to get people on

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:02,330
train on board and try to invoke this

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:06,860
type of pic yeah the youngest they know

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:09,950
more than you can imagine yeah I'm sorry

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,100
but indeed there is a hydration is so

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:19,670
low yeah tool like a space as far as i

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:22,130
know one in say in a calm area this is

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:25,790
called also the hydro space there's a

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:28,280
mid-high space ok it used to be a

00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,850
cafeteria basement as far as they know

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:38,020
the Heat were paid but they've changed

00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:42,380
it at a blog style now and the second is

00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:46,340
the great look lab which was the first

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:51,100
hyperspace they started in 2007 at the

00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:54,500
port when it was the first Biennale of

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,770
art insanity then went to tell em em

00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:01,750
straight from there to constituent in

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:10,470
now here in bellaire a say

00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:15,400
about 20 computers their limits the zoo
