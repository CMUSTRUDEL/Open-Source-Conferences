	Did you know that userland filesystems (FUSE) allow to do crazy things without the risk of crashing the kernel?
Many people know sshfs to mount remote files over ssh, but that needs an account on the remote machine.
I created curlwwwfs to read-only mount standard remote HTTP directories for fun.
With this you can peek into remote iso images (using fuseiso) or do other cool stuff.
