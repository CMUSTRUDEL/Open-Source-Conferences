Publication date: 2013-07-22
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2013
Description: 
	We all want to change the world, and The Document Freedom Day team are no different. To succeed we must identify and empower community leaders and volunteers. We've been doing that for the last five years in order to promote Open Standards around the globe, but what hurdles stood in our way? How can you overcome the same hurdles when you encounter them? And how did a team of only two staff and an intern run 60 events in a single week?

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,309
hello audience oh it's great to be here

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:15,299
when Sam I'm the campaign manager of the

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,820
Free Software Foundation Europe and one

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,619
of the things that I do in my role is

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,170
coordinate document Freedom Day which is

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:28,140
our campaign promoting open standards

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:36,530
and raising awareness within governments

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:40,500
and a republic but like that okay yeah

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,000
we want to achieve change through the

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,440
document Freedom Day campaign that's

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,550
that's the point of it and this year we

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,210
ran 60 events in one week the reason it

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:58,469
was a week rather than a day is that

00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,239
time zones and working hours mean people

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,439
run their events times to suit them

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,820
which is great because it's a flexible

00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,229
flexible campaign for them to fit their

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,979
target audience and we had our events

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,360
all over the world we had them in Taiwan

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,740
Germany the European Parliament in

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,470
Brussels we had them in Brazil several

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,659
different ones and in fact every

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:29,579
continent on Earth had a multiple

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,220
document Freedom Day events this year we

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,799
have a vision of how we'd like the

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,710
future to be in our campaign we want to

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,250
spread open standards and most of you

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,229
guys probably have your own vision of

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,049
what I'm going to call Eden to your

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,420
idyllic scenario you'd like to see in

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,439
your lifetime what you'd like to achieve

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,799
for us it's a scenario where open

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,680
standards are so ubiquitous that you'd

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,960
have to explain the concept of a file

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,270
format or a data exchange format which

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,119
was closed to somebody in order for them

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,220
to even understand what it was we want

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,379
them to be the norm and de facto

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,379
standard but

00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,750
but we're quite a long way off that

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:25,080
right now Eden we're not that close and

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,390
for whatever your own goals and whatever

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,770
Eden that you're aiming at I imagine you

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,590
know there's a good chance that's true

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,690
for you too how do we get to where we're

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,680
going how do we achieve the Eden that

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:40,530
we're pointing at ah how do we make that

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,790
vision a reality that's I want to talk

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,650
about the lessons that we've learned in

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,410
our pursuit of our reading to do with

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,870
open sans today how we got as far as we

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:53,160
have and how we plan to use the lessons

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,790
that we've learned in future and I want

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,770
to stress that in my view and experience

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,680
it's not by working harder or spending

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,560
more money not directly that we're going

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,040
to achieve our goals those things help

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,520
but they are indirect ways of getting

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,080
more people on board because ultimately

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,150
it's the people and our relationships

00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,900
with them that affect the change that we

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,270
want to see so when I'm thinking about

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,830
growing our campaign I think about how

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,360
to develop relationships and how to get

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:31,080
more people involved because ultimately

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,430
people bring resources with them even if

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,310
we can't afford to buy things directly

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,680
when we motivate passionate people they

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,330
bring their facilities to the campaign

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,710
resource pool and yeah they are an

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,820
indirect way of achieving the other

00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,820
things that we need in order to succeed

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,930
people however they are unique they

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,450
don't fit exactly what our goals are or

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:01,260
our campaign needs when we first

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,810
interact with them we find people like

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,740
this dr. Freedom Day events all over the

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,690
world who are interacting with some of

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,060
the ideas that we're explaining for the

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,470
first time how do we take people who are

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,750
uninitiated and turn them into powerful

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,680
volunteers community members that are

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,610
affecting the change that they want to

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,490
see how do we go through that process

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,990
how do we turn people who

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,800
never heard of what's important to us

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,009
before in two teams which are changing

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,130
their communities around the world

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:42,050
people like these these document Freedom

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:45,050
Day teams who constitute what we what is

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,560
our most successful campaign today how

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,229
do we get from here to there we need to

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,750
empower the people that we're dealing

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,900
with we need to supercharge them like

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,740
Mario we need to find what it is that

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,860
fits them fits their vision of where

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,560
they want to be and provide it to them

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,000
somehow such that they're achieving

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,919
their goals they're developing as a

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,960
person and they're helping to achieve

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:17,240
our wider goals as a community too we

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,990
need to find the power-ups that meet

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,960
them whether it be our how to write

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:27,889
press releases how to give speeches how

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,300
to do media editing just giving them an

00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,909
opportunity to meet other people which

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,990
will inspire them and broaden their own

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,969
network we need to identify what's going

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,639
to power up the people that we have

00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:43,849
access to so that we can work together

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,190
more effectively and ultimately we want

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,020
to end we need to end with a tight team

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,659
a team of people who work well together

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,680
who work in a synchronized way who

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,539
communicate clearly between each other

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,219
that's that can often seem like a really

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,069
long way off different communication

00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:02,719
styles different expectations of working

00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,389
environment different tools that people

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:08,690
are used to using and even just the bare

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,759
fact of different cultural different

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,310
culture cultural expectations to do with

00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,949
for instance food we have lots of cake

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,180
for doctorate Freedom Day cake costs

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,159
different amounts means different things

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,830
in different places sounds kind of silly

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,319
but it's true and we have to think about

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:28,099
that kind of thing when we're running

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,750
document freedom day event there are

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:33,589
lots of hurdles in that conversion

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,719
process between taking the uninitiated

00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,389
and turning them into a tight team and

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,630
sometimes all we can see are the hurdles

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,970
which

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,680
Queen where we're starting from the

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,110
reality of the situation that we don't

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,480
like so much and the Eden that we're

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:53,360
trying to create I see a series of

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,290
stepping stones from where we are in dr.

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,360
freedom day to where we're heading and

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:03,590
those stepping stones are I want to talk

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,930
about now which um I see as being about

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,990
shared vision for the team that you're

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,000
working with shared methods shared

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,250
expectations of quality in the way that

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,920
you work and keeping those things

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,050
synchronized during the course of your

00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,420
relationship with your team so that when

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,780
the landscape is changing around you you

00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:29,360
don't forget or lose sight of where you

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:35,020
started from right so this is a nice

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,640
stock stock photo rifles demonstrating

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,140
vision because I think vision is the

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,670
most important thing to keep a team a

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,320
team cohesive actually there's lots of

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,690
articles and blogs and even some books

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,780
about vision orientated management how

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:53,330
you can unite people by keeping them

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,880
focused on the same shared goals and

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,840
especially when working with volunteers

00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,970
sometimes that's the only thing that I

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,680
have to unite people actually because I

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,900
with teams of volunteers in political

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,380
campaigns if they don't like how they're

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,880
working or how other people around them

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,590
are treating them in that campaign team

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,950
then they simply will stop participating

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,840
and the only thing that we've got the

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,250
only tool the only thing we can offer

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,770
them in many cases is the knowledge that

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:28,880
we are aiming at the same thing as they

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,560
and that that unites us with a bond so

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,060
when we're thinking about vision what

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,520
are we trying to achieve what's the

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,150
endpoint that we're going for is our

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,190
vision to specific or too broad and I

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,039
mean for instance if we're aiming for

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,020
eighty percent change or one particular

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,640
thing does that encompass the people

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,650
that we're actually working with what

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,910
happens if some of the core people that

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,230
we're relying on to help us are in the

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,030
twenty percent of people that won't be

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,480
affected

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,920
by our 80% goal we need to think about

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,790
those scenarios and talk about them

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,950
before they happen because otherwise

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,780
vision yeah maybe all you can see is the

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,460
snowstorm around you and but times

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,790
you're going to feel isolated like these

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,110
guys you're going to be you're going to

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:15,060
feel like you don't have a map because

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,500
when the vision loses its clarity and

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,120
you're facing all the challenges that

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,990
you have when you're trying to change

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:27,100
the world in whatever way you are um

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:31,150
yeah things start to fall apart so um

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,470
yeah that's one too soon what were you

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,630
doing document reedom day is we try not

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,200
to get stuck in technical details when

00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:42,300
we're dealing with vision open standards

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:46,120
are a really complicated topic they

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,240
involve a hundred-page procurement law

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,190
in different governments they I mean

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,660
just the standard the standard documents

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,840
themselves defining how something works

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,550
are often so long that the only people

00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,080
look at ever afford to read them are

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,600
people who are being paid a salary to do

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,300
so there are competing standards there

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,390
are some which are a more restrictive

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,000
than others and all the time there are

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,980
companies who are profiting from closed

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,480
standards who are muddying the waters

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:19,240
around what an open standard is and yeah

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,340
what a government could should adopt

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,870
when they're when they're spending

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:28,570
taxpayers money on technology that's why

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,180
we try and keep a high level view of

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,160
where we're heading for we won't open

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,930
standards broadly to be adopted we want

00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:40,000
them to be widely understood widely

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:44,530
known we do have specific goals like for

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,760
instance focusing on html5 as an

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,340
alternative to lots of proprietary

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,700
platforms but even that is pretty broad

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,520
when we talk about when we try and

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,970
convince companies to switch from for

00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,340
instance adobe flash to html5 we try and

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,080
keep a very narrow focus and that's part

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,710
of the vision of the campaign in general

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,540
we keep a broad vision that will

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,460
appeal to as many people as possible and

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,820
when we get those emails every day

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,020
during the campaign launch about how

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,070
this standard might be better than the

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,920
other how PDF version 1.6 is too old to

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,420
be useful or how people can't open this

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,080
file with this application because

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,000
support is too problematic we remind

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,820
people of the broader vision that we

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,420
have and that helps stick on the same

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,490
page we have some explicit rules about

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,650
how we operate as a campaign internally

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,810
we obviously only use open standards in

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,060
the way that we work and that helps to

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,430
send a message I mean it well it it

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,670
helps send a message externally but it's

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,280
a way of living the vision that we are

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:53,230
selling to others we know that some

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,150
things are hard to do when you're using

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,800
exclusively open standards and we know

00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,410
that some things work much much better

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,640
and we do that I mean our campaign team

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,800
our volunteers people spread thinly

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,800
around mainly Europe who we're working

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,130
with on these things they come to have

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,590
first-hand experience of the situation

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,210
with these standards that that unites us

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,830
as a group because we all have that

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,890
shared experience all those things work

00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,220
in those things not and it's a way of

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,570
yeah keeping focused on a shared vision

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,240
we associate with other visionary

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,810
product projects who are very clear

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,540
about their goals that includes an song

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:38,680
in Portugal April in France and the

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,440
document foundation we are idealistic in

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,780
the goals that we have we talked about

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,700
universal adoption of open standards we

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,040
talked about governments adopting

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:53,380
University open standards at some stage

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:59,500
in future we set our sights high when

00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:02,680
we're talking in visionary terms and we

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,480
we stick to the vision that we have even

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,480
when we're socializing I mean it becomes

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,460
clear when we have new campaign members

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,920
when we're just around them when we're

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,500
talking about them it we communicate our

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,970
belief in the vision that we have by the

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,370
way that we live in by the recovery that

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,460
we use and by

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,680
yeah by the way that we work it's kind

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,779
of contagious in a way we have a shared

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,720
belief within our team that open

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,000
standards work and are going to only

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,760
improve in future and you can't help but

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,680
realize that if you stick around the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:41,980
campaign for any period of time so those

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,339
that that's how we we we have been

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,870
trying to stay focused on our vision of

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:56,560
open standards than communicating it to

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:57,850
the world we adobe acrobat reader is a

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,930
nice example Ashley I was talking about

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:05,320
PDF a second ago but yeah it's an

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,240
example in how our different people have

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,450
different vision of where open status

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,370
should be going because yeah although we

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,170
endorse only free software PDF readers

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,300
they don't have universal compatibility

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,550
with PDF files that's the lots of

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,730
technical reasons but we know as a team

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,470
that if free software PDF readers have

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,240
wider adoption there's going to be more

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,520
resources available to those to be

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,770
better solution in future that's an

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,350
example of our vision being a little bit

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,970
further ahead or broader than some of

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,560
the people that we are working with and

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,490
it doesn't work for companies who need

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:43,839
short-term solutions but we don't need a

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:47,459
our goal is having a clear vision yeah

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,459
for the campaign internally

00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:01,709
vision is theoretical however and when

00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:04,019
we're executing the things that but when

00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:05,819
we're trying to achieve this Eden that

00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,879
I've been discussing we need to be

00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:11,670
pulling in the same direction all too

00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,259
often people think they're United in the

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,839
goal that they're trying to achieve but

00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:18,870
they actually are when it comes to

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,459
strategy it's not so clear especially

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,129
when we're dealing with communities who

00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:24,660
are widely distributed when we're

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,610
dealing with people who communicate only

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,069
through mailing lists it might seem

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,050
obvious to me as a campaign coordinator

00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:35,639
that having clearly written texts is

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:38,399
more important than a meeting for

00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,230
instance some deadlines but when that

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,269
communication breaks down when our

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,509
methods aren't clearly communicated

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,480
internally then our things tend to fall

00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:50,279
apart volunteers get frustrated and we

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,970
end up spending resources we don't have

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,649
work against each other we need to make

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,839
sure we're not duplicating efforts that

00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:59,839
way giving access the resources that we

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,310
have to the people who can use the best

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,230
and that can be actually pretty tough so

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,610
that's why in dr. freedom day we have a

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,019
clear distinction between official

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,350
campaign activities and community

00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:16,199
activities we make sure that there's the

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,839
freedom for community members to do what

00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:23,220
they wish in the way that they promote

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:25,139
open standards which which results in

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,910
all kinds of events though we couldn't

00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,600
have thought of for instance last year

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,180
we had one team who had a music jam live

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,319
on stage with instruments I'd never even

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:40,230
heard before using open standards to

00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:42,059
beam their performance live different

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,790
places I couldn't have thought about it

00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,500
and if we needed a if we had a central

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,240
hierarchy rubber-stamping the activities

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,610
that people did that kind of creativity

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,189
probably wouldn't have happened at the

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,100
same time we need to make sure that we

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:58,350
do stay focused on a few core methods to

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,649
achieve the goals that we've set for

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,660
document freedom day each year and

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:06,900
that's why we try and communicate

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,120
very clearly that we have official

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,700
events and we keep that few and focused

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,370
and then more broadly there are

00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,410
community events sometimes it's

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,510
difficult to make that to make that

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,800
obvious branding and all that stuff is

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:25,410
what's useful part mother other tactics

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,450
but it's an important strategy we also

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,280
make sure that we only choose methods

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,560
together collaboratively at meetings

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,600
where human beings are physically in the

00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,460
same place preferably that means people

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,170
aren't going to forget what it is that

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,030
we're aiming at and the systems that

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,880
we're planning on using it means that if

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,330
we say we're going to have a petition to

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,590
affect how PDF is used by government

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,850
people are going to forget that

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,660
discussion because they're actually

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,610
going to been in the room at the time

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,840
voice their concerns and have their

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:57,960
input we document the systems that we're

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,120
using we make sure that it's written up

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,060
it's shared on public lists people can

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,930
refer to it I undo things as openly as

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,280
possible that means that when we have

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,110
new things that I remembered differently

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,790
by different people there's a common

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,210
place to look and people's names are on

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,220
the discussion as it took place and we

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,440
make sure we invest time in regular

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,870
training in the important tools that

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,120
that we use and in things like again

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,560
writing press releases FS of ease

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,750
president cast the girl off took the

00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,100
time to fly to our central office and we

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,290
paid for the Corps volunteers at the

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,140
campaign to come and be trained in how

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,670
to deal with when writing press releases

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,860
they didn't all develop perfect skills

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,120
but they didn't need to they're on a

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,550
road where they believe that's

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,970
achievable and we're working together as

00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:47,700
a group to improve the level of skill in

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,950
general when it comes to press releases

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,420
that means in future years the burden is

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:59,070
going to be reduced on the core staff

00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:00,990
yeah and comes to new ideas are for the

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,510
core camp for the court campaign we have

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,760
to be very strict about actually only

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,210
doing a couple of things I'm getting

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,530
five minutes notice sporting at the back

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:19,520
is it okay if I go a little bit longer

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:19,520
or am I going to be decapitated I see

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,549
okay well I'll do my best to adapt arm

00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:35,980
that's the shared method that's pulling

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:41,019
in the same direction that's

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,700
implementing the vision and yeah that's

00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:44,019
a shared method right because when

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,399
you're using a tool that doesn't allow a

00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:47,049
deviation from the method that you've

00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,999
agreed out at the start then it's hell

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,409
of a lot easier to stay focused that

00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:52,090
isn't always possible and again you've

00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:53,740
got to give people the choice to use the

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,059
tools that they like but thanks to open

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,610
standards hopefully it's going to be

00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:58,929
relatively easy for people to use the

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,159
tools that they want at the same time as

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,629
remaining readable by the people that

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:08,490
they're working with yeah so the next

00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:11,139
category of the next stepping stone is a

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,730
Simic of shared expectations of quality

00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,869
as I ventures at the beginning because

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,340
it's all very well having the same

00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:16,570
shared vision and even the same shared

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,610
strategy of where you're trying to get

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,080
to but when people have very different

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,610
expectations about what's good enough

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,039
when something is ready to be published

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,499
what is ok to represent the campaign

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,549
you're working on then again you have

00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:30,730
problems and one of the most

00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:32,440
demotivating things my experience for a

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,259
volunteer is when they put a lot of work

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,840
into something and maybe they spent you

00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:39,909
know three hours writing something or

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,830
designing something only for somebody to

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,240
spend five minutes saying that's not

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,240
good enough I'm sorry we can't use that

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,990
or alternatively yeah that's nice please

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,759
invest twice the time again yeah often

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,999
that volunteer that member of staff even

00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,600
isn't going to actually invest that time

00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,860
rocket and they're going to work on

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,360
something else and maybe next time they

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,519
have a great idea they're not going to

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,740
bother putting it into practice so it's

00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,139
a really important one this is a our

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,159
users images as a bare-bones car like I

00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,740
wouldn't describe that as a car

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,110
sometimes I see designs representing our

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,090
campaign and I think well that's not

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,009
what I had in mind when I was imagining

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,210
our branding that's not what I have in

00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,369
mind when I think of a roadworthy

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,769
vehicle but it's as you can see in

00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:23,679
Britain we have different views are

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:26,139
quality there as well but we have

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,230
strategies to for maintaining quality

00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:32,289
control often the last twenty percent of

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,090
a task is the most devoted ating the

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,830
biggest struggle because people think

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,890
they're almost there they just around

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,350
the corner and

00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,040
well to incorporate all these other

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,870
people's needs or changes modifications

00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,120
yeah that's too much effort that's why

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,860
in our campaign we make sure people are

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,530
available on the end of a phone so that

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,290
there's something to cook rated

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,850
completing a task i personally recognize

00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,430
the importance of the last twenty

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,710
percent and i try and make sure that

00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,680
people have support to do it maybe I

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,330
mean it's interesting sometimes

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,880
sometimes just spending a bit all your

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,160
own time or spending a small amount of

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,430
campaign resources on getting something

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,340
through a bottleneck can be enough to

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,860
re-energize the person who owns that

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,990
task who owns that project whatever it

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,660
is maybe that can that can motivate them

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,200
to put in that last twenty percent can

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,720
make a big difference we also refer to

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,500
what we've used in the past

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,910
unfortunately in freedom day we've been

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,190
going for more than five years now and

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,870
that means we have a backlog of articles

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,370
and graphics that we've already used and

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:41,510
it's really helpful to just be able to

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,530
refer new staff new campaign members to

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,600
stuff that we've already done as

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:47,720
examples of what's good what we think

00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,950
works using collaborative tools is also

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,120
really helpful here because it means

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,040
that before somebody has already

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,530
invested a lot of time going down the

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,060
wrong path somebody can take a look and

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,470
maybe give them a nudge in the right

00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,430
direction collaborative tools mean that

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:04,000
it's great using collaborative tools

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,530
like either pad for instance because I

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,640
people who I mean it can motivate other

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,190
people who haven't actually been

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,450
involved yet they can see okay i can

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,730
write good english maybe i don't just

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,690
writing something completely can see

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,740
this person has actually started

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,870
something they've written the first

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,400
couple of paragraphs if they were faced

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,930
with a blank slate maybe that new person

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,820
wouldn't have bothered to contribute but

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,460
when they can see there's maybe only a

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,960
quarter of a project done it encourages

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:32,090
them to get involved ah yeah it's very

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,700
important obviously to keep track of

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:37,430
these three things quality expectations

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,900
are shared methods and shared vision as

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,740
the landscape around you changes I'm not

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,630
going to talk about that much now

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,610
because I'm running short of time but

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,549
yeah it's a real challenge and I

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,559
think if you're not careful even if you

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,690
start at the same point then people end

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,750
up in wildly different places budgets

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,340
change political landscapes change some

00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,290
article about you that you didn't expect

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,500
and it reframes the campaign maybe you

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,720
need to readjust regular meetings to

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,429
make sure people stay in touch and doing

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,200
work as much in public as possible

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:11,270
really helps with that for instance try

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,620
and send more or less daily reports as

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,270
we get closer to dr. a freedom day to

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,780
make sure that people are aware of what

00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm doing yeah the last point is about

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,720
value perception of value how we

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,190
translate these things that i've been

00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,169
talking about our shared vision our

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,610
share methods how we translate the value

00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:30,169
and the importance of those things to

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,480
people that we aren't all familiar with

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,940
because what motivates us are

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,919
experiences that drove us to be

00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,840
interested in free software or open

00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,840
standards whatever your own endeavors

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,270
maybe what our experiences were are

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,470
unique to us and other people need to

00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,520
have their own aha moment really that

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,309
what you're trying to sell them is

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,200
actually relevant to them that the cost

00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:56,559
of becoming familiar and understanding

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,120
what you're trying to explain is worth

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,860
is worth their investment because our

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,520
it's actually going to pay off in

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,770
practical terms what's most helpful here

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,840
in my experience is personal stories

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,669
everybody who is involved with document

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,460
Freedom Day in an active when he has

00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,500
some experience of the benefits and the

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,230
problems associated with standards being

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,540
opened and closed just letting those

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,790
people tell their stories to the public

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,890
and to other people in their sector can

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,380
be the most effective way of winning new

00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,600
converts because they will tell it with

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,929
passion they will tell it with a reality

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,780
which can't be matched by pre written

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:37,250
dialogues or you know arguments that we

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,620
might provide on the document freedom

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,270
day website giving people the space to

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,760
engage with people who had similar

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:47,690
experiences can be the most effective

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,750
way my experience and just sharing our

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,760
methods and ideas as broadly as possible

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,590
the lessons that our camp our campaign

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,970
our local coordinators have learned

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,440
putting them in touch with each other

00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,509
making sure they get a chance to meet

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,460
you to the face to face

00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:03,929
yeah being clear about what they're

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,080
going to get back from contributing to

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,490
the campaign I mean for starters what is

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,779
it they're actually trying to achieve by

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,149
participating in doctorate Freedom Day

00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,190
is it enough that they'll contribute to

00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,480
a global public awareness campaign or is

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,649
it something very specific to their

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,200
local region that they want to achieve

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:20,610
because how we can support them as a

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,860
central team how we can support our

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,419
local groups varies hugely depending on

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,860
the answers to those questions if we

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,889
don't ask those questions then we won't

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:32,039
know that's why we do surveys several

00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:34,590
times to different groups tailored and

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,809
translated as much as possible so that

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,059
we actually have you know some hard

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:42,269
evidence from what the people that are

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:45,480
supporting us want back from us making

00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:47,370
sure that we are allocate a big chunk of

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:53,370
the resources that we have to helping

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:56,820
them achieve their own goals yeah and by

00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:01,500
doing all that uh we do empower people

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:04,110
to change the world um for the better we

00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,649
empower communities and individuals to

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,470
seek out like minded people to work with

00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:14,820
us and to promote open standards

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:17,190
ultimately we are we at FS Fe we the

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,279
document Freedom Day call campaign we

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,950
didn't run 60 events in a week I think

00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,320
that much is probably obvious by now we

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:30,090
empowered people and build relationships

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,950
to inspire other people with the belief

00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:35,850
to do that for themselves and that's all

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,059
expectations of quality uh we're going

00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,950
to grow the number of events that we

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:04,080
each year and we're going to continue

00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:06,840

never release the doors open downstairs

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:14,500
