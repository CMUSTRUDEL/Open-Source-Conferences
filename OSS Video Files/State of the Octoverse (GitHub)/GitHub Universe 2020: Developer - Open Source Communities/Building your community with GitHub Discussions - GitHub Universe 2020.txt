Title: Building your community with GitHub Discussions - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities
Description: 
	Presented by Neha Batra, Director, Software Engineering, GitHub

Calling all open source maintainers! Your communities have thrived with issues and pull requests. But sometimes you’ve had to get creative with how to engage with each other beyond code. With this session, we’ll explore GitHub Discussions and how the tool can enable you to connect with contributors on new ideas, help others without inflating your issue count, and recognize non-code contributions. We’ll give you an insider’s look at the beta, share learnings from maintainers at Vercel, Gatsby, Node,js, and others who have been testing out GitHub Discussions, and showcase the possibilities of what you can do to energize your community. We’ll even slip in a sneak peek for what’s to come!

[Music]

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,759
hi everyone

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,360
thanks so much for that introduction and

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
i'm part of the team that brought you

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,720
have discussions i'm really excited

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
about talking about building your

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
community with github discussions which

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,320
as of tuesday is available for all repos

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,160
and public beta

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
and so thousands of you have turned it

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,199
on since then

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
this talk is primarily geared towards

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
maintainers at github but if you're a

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,160
collaborator triager contributor or just

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
someone who's curious about what's in

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
what's investments i'm planning to see

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,239
so what i'm going to show you in this

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
talk is a tour through each of the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
features on github

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
discussions for each feature i'll show

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
you our recommended best practices

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
and some cool examples of how other open

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
source communities have

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,840
used those features during the past

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,840
private beta period

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
hopefully that'll give you some ideas

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,520
about what you might want to try when

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,239
you're using github discussions for your

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
community

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,280
and of course i won't leave you hanging

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
this release is only a beta

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
so i'm going to show you

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
basically a little sneak peek of some of

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
the work that we have coming up in the

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
new year

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
and i'll make sure that you know how you

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,880
can give us feedback

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,040
about what you like and what you'd like

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
to have so before i dive in i want to

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
quickly talk about the open source

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
ecosystem and why github discussions

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,119
exist in the first place

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
so this is an incredibly oversimplified

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,680
cycle of what open source works looks

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
like on github

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
so basically people use a feature tool

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
or product then they notice an issue

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,240
they file an issue

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,159
and that work will hopefully get

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
prioritized may be worked on

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,920
uh someone will open up a pull request

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,360
it'll get merged and boom it's slated

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
for a new release and it goes out into

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
the world

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,159
and people use the new thing so already

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
there's something missing

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,759
and um that is where the conversation

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,880
lives and that's because it usually

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,719
lives over here outside of the cycle

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,719
products ignite ideas and facilitate

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,960
conversations and that conversation ends

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,759
up in chat applications forums social

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,520
news

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,520
and basically sometimes github issues

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,640
and as someone who used to work full

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,399
time on open source

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
products at github i'll tell you right

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
now it's really difficult to manage

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
both conversations and work within

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,080
github issues

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,760
and you've told us that too you don't

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,520
want someone writing in your to-do list

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,319
and you want github issues to be a place

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
of focus

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,560
we heard you we want to keep q a and

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
conversations separate from github

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
issues

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
but we also don't want those to be

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,519
completely detached either their

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,519
relationship is important

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,680
that's why we've added github

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
discussions into the cycle github

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,800
discussions brings the important

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,040
conversations to the place you work

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
without overlapping them with defined

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,239
prioritized ongoing work that you have

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
in issues and pull requests

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
so you can think of github discussions

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,360
as the living room of your open source

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
community

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
so work with me you have discussions is

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
a place where people can come in

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
grab a seat on the couch chatter maybe

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
get a new idea

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,760
maybe get inspired by that idea and i

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
don't know venture over to the kitchen

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
and cook something up

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,560
it's really clear that i probably

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,159
selected this metaphor because it's 20

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,159
20 and i don't have a living room

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,920
full of people but i have found you have

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
discussions to be a virtual homey place

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
to interact with my community

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,120
the best part is that it enables

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,599
non-code contribution pathways

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
so it lets people interact amongst

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
themselves and help each other

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
and it also makes people makes it easier

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,159
for the folks with questions to talk to

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
the people with answers

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
be it maintainers collaborators if

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
someone who's just been there before

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,000
so let's get started shall we if you

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
haven't enabled discussions yet

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
i'm going to show you how now so to

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,200
start you're going to want to go to your

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,040
repos settings page and then you can go

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,720
on that default page scroll down to the

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,840
features section and you'll see a

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
discussions check box waiting for you

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,560
and it looks like

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,720
this so you can click on set up

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
discussions to get started and this is

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
going to take you to a pre-made template

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
that we've set up for you

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
you can review modify it maybe you don't

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
want any of those comments in

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
and then voila click on start discussion

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
and you have your first discussion

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
now it's good to pin important

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
discussions like this one so you can

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,760
click on pin discussion

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
and then you can kind of choose a really

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
cool color i love the blue one

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,879
obviously we're going to go with the

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,680
octa cats you can click on pin

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,360
discussion

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
and there you have it on your index page

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
your first discussion

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
now if you have issues that should be

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,639
discussions you can

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
cover those individually um convert them

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
in or in bulk

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,880
so if you wanted to do it in bulk you

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
can go here to the label section

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,479
here we selected the question label

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
obviously probably the best one for that

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
is a q a

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
category and there you go all you have

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,320
to do is click that button and you're

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,520
going to convert those from your issues

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
over to your discussions

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,880
and you can see that over on your

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
discussions page now as i mentioned

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,600
before github discussions has been in

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
private beta since may

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,639
which means we've seen a lot of really

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,840
creative ways to get started so i'm

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,720
going to show you two examples about

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,919
best practices

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,840
that you can use a best practice

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,280
is to customize even your first

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
introduction

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,160
exactly for your community and so this

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
is one that i wanted to show you which

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
is the pi stock community

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,720
that took the setup template that we

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
provided and they translated that also

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
into chinese

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
to introduce discussions into their

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,000
community in two languages

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
another discussion that gets a lot of

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
traction is the one where

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
it's a welcome discussion where you can

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,560
help introduce yourself

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
i think this is especially valuable for

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,520
maintainers and collaborators to post in

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
the discussion early

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,280
basically to set this tone and tell

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
people how you'd like your community to

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
introduce themselves

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
and what information you'd like others

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,720
to post in also

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
so we've gotten started congrats here's

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
a map of what i'm going to show you for

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,120
the main course of the talk

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,800
i'm going to be going through

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
customizing categories creating

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,199
discussions

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
answering questions recognizing

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,240
contributions and your moderation

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
options

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,160
so let's start with categories every

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
repository comes with a default set of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
four categories

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,639
general ideas q a and show and tell but

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
these can be modified only maintainers

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,440
and admins can do that

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,800
and so what you're going to do is you're

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,720
going to see that edit button only

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
available to those people

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
i'm going to click on it so when you get

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
there you're going to see the categories

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,680
edit page and you can click on edit for

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,600
any category

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
or if you click on a new category i'm

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
going to try one call it components

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
um obviously i'm going to choose the

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
avocado emoji because

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,800
i mean there's no explanation needed and

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,479
i'm going to choose a description

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
description so that people know which

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,199
category to choose and what we're left

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
here with is a discussion format

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,199
now the discussion format you have two

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
options one is an open-ended discussion

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
which is just for casual conversations

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,720
and the other one is question answer

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,639
so that means that any discussion that's

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
created in that category

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,720
allows either the author or the

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,199
maintainer or a collaborator maintainer

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
to select an answer for every discussion

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
that exists in that category

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,520
so you can always go in you can modify

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,400
that later if it's working or it isn't

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,319
working for you

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,319
so here are some examples of what other

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
open source communities have created for

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,080
their categories

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,520
so the first one here is with nextgs

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,520
you're not seeing anything particularly

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
unique in the categories here but the

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,199
interesting thing here

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,199
is that in their ideas category they use

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
this as an rfc which means request for

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
comments

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
and so maintainers often present their

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
ideas to the community

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
and they're looking for comments and to

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,680
get reactions to what those ideas are

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599
i really think that's like a cool way to

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,520
utilize the ideas category

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
the second example i have here is azure

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,479
pl so they have some of their categories

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,400
in polish

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
um which makes sense for their community

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
the third one is home assistant and

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,680
they have the accessibility and

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
localization categories which is

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,479
important because it helps people with

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,080
the expertise

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
find the discussions and they can help

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
with right away fomantic ui is our

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
fourth example

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,479
and they've chosen to use their

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
categories in a more structured way to

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,800
filter out

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
the kinds of conversations that people

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
typically come up

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
for that repository and finally gatsby

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
js has a cool

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,680
umbrella discussions category and

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,680
they've been using this

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,360
for um for the maintainers to open up

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,160
discussions around topics like

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,199
cash clearing flags or parallel sourcing

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,759
and it's often with

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,199
links or docs or basically helpful

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,120
information for the community

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,560
and it opens up this to the community

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,960
for questions bugs ideas or updates

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,080
i think the most important thing about

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,599
categories

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,199
is that um you get to set the tone here

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,520
to help the community know what to

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,280
expect and where to go it's like a map

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
so if they're a common area that you

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
notice that comes up over time you can

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
always create new categories

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
or maybe you realize a category is

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
seldom used and you can go ahead and

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
delete it

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
and don't worry when you go to delete a

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,519
category if we notice that there's

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,839
discussions inside we're going to ask

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
you

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
where you'd like to reassign those

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
discussions um and take note that you do

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
have a maximum of 10 categories that you

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
can create

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,480
okay now that you have the right

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,320
categories it's time to walk you through

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
that new discussion flow once more

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,279
and i'm going to point out a few things

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
that happen after you click that shiny

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,560
green button

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,839
so the first thing that i want to point

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
out is that you can see in this drop

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,200
down

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,959
that's where your title and your

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
description show up so when you're

00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
creating your description you want to

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
make sure you're gearing it towards your

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
user

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,080
and the second is that once you post a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
discussion on the right hand side here

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
you can see a piano of the things that

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
you can do

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
to moderate the discussion and that's

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
only available for certain roles

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
and finally when you pin discussions i

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
want you to know that you can pin up to

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
four discussions

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,160
my personal recommendation is that it

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
looks way cooler if you switch up the

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
colors and the patterns of the pin

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,320
discussions

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
to give it a more dynamic feel and once

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,880
you have a pin discussion you can always

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,440
go back and edit it

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,680
you can unpin you can even reorder the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,800
all the pin discussions all together

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,720
as a maintainer you can also go back and

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
edit anyone's individual discussions for

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
someone else that's posted

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
to help things become more structured

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,240
and organized

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
so here's an example here where snowpack

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
has uh

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,880
used the a pin discussion as their

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,480
change log

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
and so it's kind of pinned at the top

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
you can see that fred's got some spot-on

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
gifs here

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
and what i love is that each comment is

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,080
a new version and it details and it

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
allows people to easily reply

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
with thoughts or words of thank or

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
encouragement

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,640
another one that i think is really cute

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
is that react hook forum has a community

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120
member

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,040
they a community member went in and they

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,560
congratulated the community

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,000
for an award that they received which i

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
thought was so sweet and charming and

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
it's really appreciated

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,600
and so of course the matingers went back

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,440
and they pinned that discussion

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,120
here's a q a example for you and you

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
can't exactly see it here

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
but in this thread the author had asked

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,480
about getting a tile with spaces between

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,240
images and global borders

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
and someone had posted an answer within

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,200
reply and within those replies you can

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
see here

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,480
multiple people are jumping in to help

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,480
make that answer more helpful

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,399
and for this example specifically what

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
had happened was that two people had

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,800
posted answers

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
and they're really helpful and so

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,440
there's this really awesome dynamic

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,800
where the original author of the post

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
was like i don't know which one to pick

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,480
you both have been so helpful

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,920
and then both uh responders said like

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
don't worry about it it's just about

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,440
like getting the right answer

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
and i just felt like this was a really

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
adorable uh

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,040
example because it's what you would see

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,160
in a healthy open source community

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,000
and i thought that was wonderful so

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
this is another example it's an example

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
of where a maintainer saw a question

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,440
realized there was a legitimate bug they

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,880
opened an issue for it and a pr for it

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
and they merge and deployed it when they

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
came back

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,120
they followed up and they said like hey

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,680
this is corrected and it was in the same

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
day

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,079
so this is a really cool way to kind of

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,079
uh connect both the discussion and the

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,640
issues and have that duality work

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,079
and they marked that as the author marks

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
that as an answer so that anyone who

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,640
comes back

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,839
will see that that is now fixed and this

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,839
is like in a new version

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
another example i wanted to talk about

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,000
was that 2020 is really real and

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
of course all the time there are cases

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
where maintainers aren't going to be

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
able to

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
keep up with their community and it's

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,040
totally okay to open up a discussion

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
explaining that you can pin that at the

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,760
top and that way your community knows

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
what to expect

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
and um you can kind of see that people

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,360
have reacted really well to this

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,200
discussion

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
so let's get directly into the mechanics

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,160
of marking an answer so anyone with

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
triage plus

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
access or the author can do this and

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
this is kind of what it looks like

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
when you find an answer to a question

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
you can click on the check box and a

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,800
great box will appear and you can say

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
who marked the answer

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,600
and it'll be recorded so you can even

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,360
see who marked it right underneath

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
and so i guess brooklyn was asking for

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
the best guacamole recipe here

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
without anyone else responding she

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
marked her own answer

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
i don't actually see this happen too

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
often not many people are asking for

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
guacamole recipes but um

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,000
this is kind of an example of what you

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,440
can see and i'll give you more realistic

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,920
examples now

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,519
so here's an example where an author

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,120
might mark their own answer because they

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
asked a question they did some research

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,079
and they went back to answer it

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,440
um and so you can see that it'll help

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
everyone else who comes across that

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,480
question

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,920
and here's an example where the

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
maintainer knew the answer to the

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
question

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,720
because it was about an existing bug but

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,959
they even went into the replies and they

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,200
helped that person get access to

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,200
where the pr was to get the fix up front

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,120
now you can see an answer uh

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,720
was marked here um but i think this is

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,839
more for humor and so it gets bonus

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,839
points for creativity

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,000
so you can see that uh someone that the

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
maintainer had asked is adonis five

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
uh production ready and they responded

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
to their own answer as yes i thought

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,720
that was really cute and so i wanted to

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,160
point out the example

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,760
now we have all the tools that we need

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,360
to manage existing discussions let's

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
talk really briefly about some

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
enhancements we have

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
to improve the community's interactions

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,120
and first things first you can see right

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
here there's a leaderboard

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
on the right hand side and it shows

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
people with the most answered

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
discussions

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
so when someone's answer is marked as an

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
answer it might show up in a leader

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
board especially if they're in the top

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
eight

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,800
but you'll also see that data gets added

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
to their hover card so in the middle

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
here

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,639
you can see when you hover over

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,279
someone's name it tells you

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
for example robin has answered a few

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,399
discussions in the past week but 36 in

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,920
the last month

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,440
and then if you were to go on their

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,360
profile you'll see a total count so

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,279
they've answered 116 overall

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
at the time of us taking the screenshot

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,000
i thought that was pretty cool

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
this is the kind of information that you

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
can use to understand who's particularly

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
active

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
and might be a candidate to become a

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,240
triager or someone with write access one

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
day

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
and we actually have a story for that

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,760
for you so

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
next js was an early adopter of github

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
discussions and they kept noticing that

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,959
james mosher was one of the people who

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,959
were consistent in answering discussions

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,399
and so with that data that was able that

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,720
they were able to see

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
they basically went and approached james

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,959
and they asked him if he wanted to be

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,279
part of the community

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,320
and he became a treasurer for nextjs and

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
he said yes

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,240
so this is a great example of how

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
important non-code contributions and

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,760
valuable they are

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,279
how important and valuable non-code

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
contributions are and

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
how the maintainers can leverage that

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
leverage that information to bring

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
people into the community even more

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
so we got his permission to tell the

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,880
story and when we asked him about it

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
he shared how he remembered really

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
vividly what it's like to start coding

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,160
and have a ton of questions and it's his

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
way of giving back

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,600
so he said that answering and

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,279
discussions allowed him to learn a ton

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
by digging into the next code

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,880
nexus code base and he wanted to make

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,480
sure that he was accurately answering

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
those questions

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
and you can even see that this comes

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
with a sense of pride so you can see on

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,399
his profile he even added it to his

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
readme

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,839
and so you never know who might emerge

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,040
to build the community and thank you for

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,720
letting us share your story james

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,560
finally i wanted to briefly talk to you

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
about what you can do with triager

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,240
write maintainer and admin permissions

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
and as far as discussions go

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
people with write maintain admin access

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,279
can basically do the same thing with two

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,759
exceptions

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
so um people with maintain an admin

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
access

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
can enable discussions altogether from

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,040
the settings page and

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
also they're the only ones who can

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
create and edit categories but otherwise

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
they have the same permissions

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
so i'm going to show you what you can do

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
with triage roles and write roles

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,320
so when you're selecting people in the

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,839
community you can know which ones to

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,000
give

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
so i've got three spots to point out so

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,480
the first one is the in the kebab

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,079
for each commun discussion comment or

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
answer or reply

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,519
you can um click on the kebab and so

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,040
people with triage plus

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,800
roles can hide comments um replies etc

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
and people with write plus can actually

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,920
go ahead and edit them

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,160
now on the right hand panel there you

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
also have a few options so triagers plus

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
can

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,720
lock a discussion and people with write

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,639
plus access can transfer it

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
pin a discussion or delete it and in

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,040
this example you can kind of see through

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
the events

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
that brooklyn went in they locked the

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,720
conversation and so

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
people with that access can also a

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,759
triage plus access can unlock it

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
finally in the top right you can see

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,480
that there

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
you can you see a little gear icon next

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,079
to the category which means you can

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,199
change

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,480
the category um so that is for people

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,560
with write plus access

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
and if you ever another thing that's

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,639
really valuable to know is that if you

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
can convert

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,759
if you convert an issue to a discussion

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,680
it carries over the moderation as well

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,519
so in case you're curious this is what

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,759
it looks like one this is what a hidden

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,440
comment looks like

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,440
and that's basically it that's what you

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
have so we talked about getting started

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
categories new discussions marking

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,160
answers how you can use the information

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
the site to

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,720
provide recognition and how to moderate

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
and keep the community healthy

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,319
now github discussions is still a work

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,000
in progress it's genuinely a beta

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
product and so we'll be iterating on it

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,559
to get

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,000
it to ga after the holidays and here's

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
something that some things that we're

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
cooking up

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
so the first one that you've probably

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
already noticed is that if you're on the

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
beta for ios or android discussions is

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
available in the github application

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,600
if you're not on the beta here's a sneak

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
peek of what you'll see when it comes in

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
at gas in the new year

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,720
so you'll be able to open moderate mark

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
and reply to discussions in true async

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
fashion

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
the second thing i wanted to give you a

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,440
glimpse of is up voting so we're still

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,919
playing with the feel of it but you'll

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,200
be able to

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,919
you've been able to do this on the

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,760
universe repo and you'll be able to soon

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,080
do this overall we're still playing with

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
it

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,919
it's in the features in private beta um

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,039
to be able to upvote both discussions

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,039
and comments

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,160
um so that'll also be feeding into a

00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,840
sort which means that you'll be getting

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,200
the most valuable discussions sorted up

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,559
top

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,559
and that's not all

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
uh just trying to get my uh

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,360
oh there we go cool so that's not all we

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,600
have a long road ahead

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:23,200
and oh no i think there's a lag

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,880
oh no there we go okay cool

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
so we've got a long road ahead and to

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,240
give you um to give you the product that

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
you need to build the community even

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
more successfully

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
here are some of the things that are on

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,120
our roadmap in case you were curious

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,320
and the best way to hear about upcoming

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
features is

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
as they become available is to give us

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
feedback and to come and find us in our

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
open source repository

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,160
so for today you can go to the universe

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,000
one this is a

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
short link it'll redirect you to the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
github universe 2020 repo

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,320
i'll be there right after um and beyond
