Title: How we’re working with the community to build docs as an interface for code - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities
Description: 
	Presented by Kath Korevec, Senior Director, Product, GitHub

Just like code, docs shouldn't be static. They need to evolve and respond to the changes in the developer world every day. That's why we believe that GitHub Docs are better when they're used in the open—with the people who are building the features and those who are using them all participating in tandem. In this talk, you'll hear about why and how we took our docs public, and the lessons we learned along the way.

[Music]

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,160
all right that was awesome

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,640
and yeah so my name is kath and i work

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,680
on the product team at github where i'm

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
focused on

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
working on our documentation and i'm

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,680
really excited to be here

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,439
today to talk with you about some of the

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
updates that we've been making to the

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,560
docs

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
and if you've been following along

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,480
you've probably seen some of the stuff

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
that we've

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
that we've been working on but really

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,920
this is about

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,120
where we're taking documentation with

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,120
the help of our community

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
so kind of to set your expectations i

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
just want to talk through

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,840
a little bit of the goals that we have

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
for for today's session

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
we're going to get to know kind of why

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,640
we open source documentation

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,360
and we're also going to learn about how

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,199
you can make

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
contributions to the github

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,840
documentation itself at get that slash

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
github

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
docs and then we're going to discover

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
where we're taking documentation and

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,119
hopefully you feel

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,119
a little bit inspired

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,759
and so we've been doing a lot to update

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
github documentation this year

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
so yeah if you've been following along

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,960
you've likely noticed that we've been

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,439
iterating and updating a whole bunch of

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
stuff

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
within our get our github actions

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
documentation and we actually just

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
released two brand new pages

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
for github education and github

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
discussions

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,799
and so you can you can definitely follow

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,040
along go check out those docs for sure

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
but one of our main goals with this and

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
these updates is to go from this more

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,960
traditional documentation site to one

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,479
that is from one that is kind of this

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
more technical manual

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,600
to one that is highly immersive and

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
interactive

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
and and one that really highlights a lot

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
of what our community is

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,040
and invites them to participate and

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
github docs have

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
always been written and managed in code

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
and stored

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
and maintained in a github repository

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
but to our users they present as

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
a lot of text to work through and so

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,479
really the only way to interact with

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,599
them

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
is to go and read them maybe side by

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
side with another tab that you're

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,959
working in

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
but you're still just reading through

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,000
them and we know people learn

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
in many different ways and so on the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
docs team we're naturally

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
experimenting with updating the

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,840
documentation to be

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,280
more inclusive or to have more in

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,599
interactive features

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
you can actually see something that we

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,400
have been experimenting with

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,800
one of the demos that that we've been

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
really

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,760
liking is over on

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,640
playground.herokuapp.com

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,319
you can see some of the interactive

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,000
elements that we're playing with we do

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,040
that there kind of before we migrate

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,120
things into

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,400
the larger docs set so we can kind of

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
play around with them and make sure the

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
interactions are correct

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
because we want everything to be very

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,239
precise

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
and up to date and so go over there to

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
check out things like we're at

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,680
like an editor experience that we're

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,680
adding and videos etc

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,680
but just like code docs really should

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
not

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
never be static products always change

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,000
and we're always coming

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
to understand them through many

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
different kinds of

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
lenses and a lot of different

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,239
experiences too

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,519
so on the docs team at github we're

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
constantly updating

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
the docs to make sure that they're

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,760
accurate

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
and uh this year we're taking that that

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
even like one step further to create

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
this really

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
living breathing application that's a

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
reflection of the content

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
the community and the tools that we're

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,040
building at github

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,680
as we shift new things

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,159
and github's products are they really

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,040
reach this wide variety of developers

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,680
and often we see that developers on the

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
docs

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,319
who developers come to the docs who are

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
new to github entirely some of them are

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,439
new to git entirely

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
and we want to understand and

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
incorporate their perspectives

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
into all of the different so that we

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,239
reach all the different types of

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,159
developers

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,280
so whether you're new to programming or

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,280
new to github

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
or you've just you're just new to one of

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
the products that we've recently shipped

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
as developers we're always learning

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,600
something different

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
and whether it's a new language or it's

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
a new github project

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,360
or new github features we want to get

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,560
that perspective baked in

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,479
i know for me when i am um

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
when i'm when i'm an expert in something

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,440
i explain it in a totally different way

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
than if i'm new to something and so we

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
we see

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,440
people we see developers of many

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,720
different walks coming to

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,040
github documentation so we want to

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
provide that perspective for all of

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,919
those folks in our documentation

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
and really the goal is docs should be

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,080
simple

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,759
and easy to use they should

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
offer many different ways to digest

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
information through

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,720
reading text or stories or looking at

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,120
other examples from other developers

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
or through things like tutorials or more

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,080
interactive

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
elements like videos or an ide that you

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,919
can test out certain

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,440
examples from you should be able to play

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,560
with all of these products

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,560
while you're learning them

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
and so this is a big reason why we

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
decided to

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,680
take docs.gov.com and make them open

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
source so we did this this past october

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,160
and i'm really excited to talk with you

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
about how that's been going

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
and this is from the moment we actually

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
flipped the switch it was

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
just before 9 00 a.m and on i think it

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,960
was like october

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
at the beginning of october we did this

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
for hacktoberfest

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
and we got this notification in our

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
slack channel so there's a little bit of

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,600
a celebratory moment

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,240
mona timed into it was really pretty fun

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,240
and what this meant for us was not just

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
that we had hit this milestone

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,280
that we had been planning for a really

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
long time but

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,039
it meant that we got to invite the

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,160
community in to collaborate with us

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,199
on docs.github.com through issues and

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,039
pull requests

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,840
and discussions and even through their

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
own projects

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
so one of the examples that i really

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,440
love

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,319
from early on in our open source journey

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,160
is this

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,400
guide and this was written by chrissy

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,680
lamarr she's a powershell developer

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
and the maintainer of dba tools and i'll

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
tell you a little secret

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
we don't have anybody on the docs team

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,680
that specializes in powershell

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,199
but we do have developers in our

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,039
community who

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,240
really want to know how they can create

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
ci workflows

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
and test their powershell project so i

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
think it was on day one

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,479
chrissy got really excited and started

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
to write out this guide

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,599
and she and i got to talking and i was

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
like you know what we should just do

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
this

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,479
and it was great because she knows a ton

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
about powershell and

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,800
a lot about github actions and so she

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,199
really got to bring that expertise

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
we collaborated with her on this so that

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
she could help

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,840
with so we could help her with content

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
styles and

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,680
contributing and and create this

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
whole new article for people so we could

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,080
reach even more folks through this

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
tutorial

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,840
who are in the powershell community even

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
before we shipped this

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
we knew that it was going to be

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
successful and people wanted it because

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,560
we saw people using it as a pr before we

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
even merged it into the main branch

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
and open sourcing really what it does is

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,840
it lets us plug some of these gaps

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,840
that we have in our documentation by

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,800
inviting experts in like chrissy to

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
participate

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
and working with her to help tell this

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,919
story and write the tutorials themselves

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
and if you go to github uh doc

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
executive.com

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
actions you'll see chrissy's tutorial

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
featured

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,280
um and and called out in on that page so

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
you can go

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,319
and learn how to build and test with

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
powershell

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,440
so we open source docs.github.com

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,240
in two main parts or sorry main parts

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
we open source the content itself and

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,599
the application

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
and the content is all in markdown and

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,599
uses liquid rendering

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
the app that powers this is mostly

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
node.js

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
and we've recently started to experiment

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,479
with adding react

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,919
components to it to help it help make it

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,840
more interactive

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,120
and so you'll see some of that stuff

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
coming soon

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
and you can check out that demo for it

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,880
on on that url that i mentioned before

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,880
doc's playground

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,640
so i'm going to walk you through a

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,240
really quick demo

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,839
for how to contribute um really easily

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,000
and get started

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,360
so here we have the quick start for

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360
github actions

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
and i'm just going to scroll down and

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
i'm going to go over and i'm going to

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,040
click this button

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,880
make a contribution and once i click

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
that i'm actually taken to

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,320
the code base and and that page

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,480
in edit github edit mode and i can

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,440
actually make that contribution and then

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,360
go through the the github pr workflow

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,959
itself

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
and so you see me do this over and over

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
again

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,760
so um this uh

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,680
this project has been going on for quite

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
a while and this summer we decided to

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
kind of

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,279
crank it up so we could hit our

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,800
milestone of being able to open source

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,279
in october with hacktoberfest but

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,720
we also had that didn't that was that

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,920
was definitely not without its

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,240
challenges and so

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
if you are you know if you're taking a

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
project public

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,360
that has already been established you

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
definitely know that

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
that there's a lot that goes into it a

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
lot that goes into planning the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
contribution guidelines

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
things that um and things that you want

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,200
to account for in issues etc

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,440
so we had several um

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
we had several different challenges

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,600
along the way and i'm going to talk

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,839
about three of them

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
and this first one is that we actually

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,720
on the documentation team we work in

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
public and we work in private and that's

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
really because

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,160
while we do work against our

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,760
our product roadmap and a lot goes into

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
our product roadmap that that you all

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
can see

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,320
there's a lot of detail that happens in

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
the documentation

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,640
and about the features and how to use

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,440
them etc so before we launch we actually

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
want to

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,880
work on all of those that documentation

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
in private and that happens on a

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
repository

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,480
um on an internal repository and then we

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,320
also maintain our external repository

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
so what this does you can imagine we've

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
got you know maintaining that all of

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
this stuff

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
manually could get really tricky so we

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
we use two different things

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
to help us with this we use a github

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
action that

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
is called it's actually open source it's

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
called repo sync

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,360
that actually syncs prs that are merged

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
into the main branch every 15 minutes

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,640
and this allows us to work across both

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,360
repositories in more of an automated way

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
and then we also use early access

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
documentation

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
and so we do ship sets of documentation

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
that are available to customers

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
for certain features that are under a

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
private data

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,040
and this allows us to ship things to our

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
customers to test out those

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
features that we're shipping to them in

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
a private beta as well as the

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,000
documentation

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,519
so that we can fine-tune all of those

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
bits of the documentation

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,800
while the product changes in private

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,839
beta before

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,720
it goes into ga and make sure that that

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,880
everything is accurate

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,519
and then our ci and cd workflow

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,600
uh was also very challenging we have we

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,760
have over 40 github actions in

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
our docs repo and many of them are used

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,040
for ci cd

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,360
so there's a lot going on here we've got

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,480
internal contributions to our internal

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,639
repository

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
that's synced every 15 minutes we've got

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,120
open source contributions that are

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
happening

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
and we have lots of conversations that

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
are going on with

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,160
all of this content our content set is

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,360
really large and so there's a lot to pay

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,399
attention to

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,000
when you open up a pr for um

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,399
for the docs for the docs

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,920
um repository sorry about that i think

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
you could probably hear my dogs i've got

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,959
a clique and an australian shepherd

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,800
and they love everything to do with open

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,760
source documentation so they might chime

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,839
in

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,040
but when you open up a pr for this

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,720
you're um

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
you you you know you want all of your

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
checks to pass and so

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
we do lots of there's lots of stuff

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
going on we do what a lot of developers

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,639
do

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
which is keep that pr open and kind of

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,880
babysit it

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,880
while we wait for all those checks

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,120
checks to pass and then

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,320
click the manual merge button but now

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,600
with auto merge

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
we can actually go about doing our

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,839
doing our business go into onto other

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,120
projects open up other pr's

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
and as neha said let the robots deal

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,880
with

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,880
actually automatically merging that into

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,040
the main branch and then finally

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
one of the things that is really

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,880
important to us on documentation

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
and this is actually baked into all of

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
our content styles and our content

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,880
architecture

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,600
and how we write our documentation

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,760
is translations and so our docs are

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
available in five different languages

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
english chinese japanese spanish and

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
portuguese

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
which brian would brian would love to

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
know because he's learning a lot about

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,959
portuguese

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
this whole week but today we use a tool

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,160
called

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
crowden to help us translate all of our

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,440
content

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
and keep us updated as we make changes

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
to the documentation

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,959
so we update we translate documentation

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,040
as it gets

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
inserted brand new into the code base

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
but then every time that documentation

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
changes

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,160
crowd and manages that whole entire

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,680
process and lets people know

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,000
when there are changes or when there are

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,120
new contributions that need to be

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
translated and right now we don't have a

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
way

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
to accept open source contributions to

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
our open source

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,000
repository for these translation files

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
and this is because you know we're uh

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,760
we're

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,680
us on the docs team we don't have all of

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,199
the uh we don't have a lot of experts in

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,000
all of these different languages

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,199
to be able to review and verify that

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
those translations

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,560
were actually correct and accurate but

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
we do

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,880
really want to make it possible for

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,519
people to update language our language

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,480
files

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,160
in the open source repository and also

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
continue to work with crowdin

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
to manage all of these these translation

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,120
projects

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,440
so we're working on this a way to offer

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
open source uh contributions to our

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
language files

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,839
coming in the next year

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,839
and right now there are there are lots

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,240
of different ways

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,600
to contribute to our open source

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
documentation

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
and three of them that we really love

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
are

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:16,079
these three you can that um

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,440
it's basically you can contribute with

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,279
small bug fixes

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,560
and those are going to be things like

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,360
you know typos

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,199
or a small bug in the code base you can

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
also contribute with curated issues

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,120
something that's a little bit beefier

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
and that you need some advice from our

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
content writers on

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,480
but something that's not too large where

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,759
you would actually have to get into the

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,639
nuts and bolts of

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,160
really understanding our content styles

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,800
and our content architecture

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,920
and how that all works that is coming

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
soon and so

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,440
you i've i kind of teased this in the

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,079
beginning of my talk

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,160
we chris chrissy lamarr actually

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,680
contributed on this final path

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,600
um which is an entirely new article and

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
because we have a lot going on like

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,399
translations

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,079
we really need to pay attention to

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,720
what's what's going on with our

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,680
content styles also working with chrissy

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,240
and working with

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,120
open source maintainers or open source

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,199
contributors

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,360
on these types of projects actually

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,639
allows us to get a ton of feedback about

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
our content styles

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
and our contributing workflows and so we

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,320
can actually we can keep iterating on

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
how this process works

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
and we're fine-tuning it right now so

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,839
that we can get more contributions

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,920
uh for entire articles or tutorials from

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,800
the community because we really want to

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,399
highlight

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,839
what everybody's doing and work with our

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,199
community in all three of these

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,600
capacities

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,720
and so we're we're not only drawing on

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
what's going on

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,600
in our open source repository

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
but we're also drawing on what's going

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
on within the community itself so i'm

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,320
going to show you something that we

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,519
recently added to the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,199
github actions page which is

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,560
code examples so i know when i'm

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,800
learning a new language

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,399
or about a new feature i like to turn to

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,519
other developers and see how

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,280
they're using it and here you see me

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,760
navigating through

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,319
a all of the different code examples and

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,039
then

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,799
these link directly to github we're

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,000
actually using sarah drezner's awesome

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,600
actions list

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,760
it's been mentioned several times this

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,400
whole entire week it's a really great

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,120
resource if you're looking for

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
if you're looking for code examples for

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,079
actions

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
and if you can't we don't have an action

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,760

for um for whatever you're looking for

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
