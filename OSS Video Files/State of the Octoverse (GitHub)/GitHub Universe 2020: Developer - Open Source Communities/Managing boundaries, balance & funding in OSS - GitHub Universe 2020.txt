Title: Managing boundaries, balance & funding in OSS - GitHub Universe 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-11
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2020: Developer - Open Source Communities

Most technologies built today rely on the work of open-source maintainers. In addition to building highly-valued open source projects, maintainers put in long hours to build software, fix issues, field questions, and manage communities—all while figuring out monetization strategies to sustain their technologies. In this session, you’ll hear from three leaders whose meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem have become full-time careers. We’ll dive into their lessons learned, discuss the burnout maintainers often face, and share how other developers can prevent and overcome those challenges, solve for monetization challenges, and build healthy, sustainable habits in open source.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,759
hi

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,160
everybody i am sasha rosenbaum i'm a

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,240
product manager here at github and it is

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,680
my absolute pleasure today to host a

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,720
panel on managing

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
boundaries balance and funding in open

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,199
source

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,519
if you've been watching github universe

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,240
sessions today in the previous couple of

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
days

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,519
you know that the world is largely

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,360
powered by open source

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,160
but you also know that open source is

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,360
not necessarily easy to get started with

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,840
or easy to get into manage

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
and so on and so forth so i may be

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
biased but i think

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
whether you're just getting started or

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
you already have a big project and

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
you're looking to get it funded

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,879
or you're just looking to figure out how

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
did you have work-life balance in open

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,239
source

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,280
this panel is for you and here we're

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,239
talking with some

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
really great open source maintainers um

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,799
gina hoyske

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,040
evan yeoh and wes mckinney and

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
these discussions actually started with

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
the github readme project where we

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
learned

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
a little bit about each of the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,600
maintainers and had a flavor

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,439
privilege to hear some of their stories

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,159
and we just wanted to bring it out

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,680
over to you and you can also look it up

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
at github.com

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,119
readme to read more about each one of

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,680
our panelists

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,200

i'm also an independent open source

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
developer

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,040
i work on the front-end javascript

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,640
framework called vue.js

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,599
and i've been doing it full-time since

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,120
2016.

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,040
back to you sasha awesome and

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,200
wes why don't we continue introductions

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,000
hi i'm wes mckinney i'm best known as

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,080
the creator of the python pandas project

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
over the last last several years i've

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
been focused on the

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
the apache aero project and i currently

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,200
direct ursa labs which is a

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,200
group of six six full-time apache aero

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,879
developers thank you wes

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,120
so um my first question is actually

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
what would you define describe your role

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
as as open source maintainer

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
and do you know let's get us started

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,599
i would say it's like a bit of a mixture

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360
of being a gardener

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,200
a parent and an architect at the same

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,200
time on the one hand you have to take

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,959
care of your code and make sure it grows

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
and all that you have to educate your

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,440
users

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
and sometimes also resolve some

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,879
struggles or something

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,640
and also of course you have to build

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,159
build new things

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
and wes how would you describe your

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,959
always open source maintainer

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
yeah i also think it's it's a hybrid

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,680
role i i i myself think of it as

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
a cross between a librarian and a cat

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,879
herder so

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
partially you know my my job is to keep

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,239
all of the information

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
um the road map and the issue tracker

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
you know organized and orderly so that

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
people can arrive and make uh

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,319
successfully make contributions to the

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,920
project while also making sure that that

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,680
all of the contributors and other

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,440
maintainers are

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
are being productive and and that the

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,560
whole project as a whole is healthy and

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,640
making uh

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,159
you know making good decisions and you

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,599
know respecting its code of conduct and

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,439
its governance principles and so forth

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,480
and evan how would you describe you're

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,040
always open source mediator

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,720
yeah i share pretty much the same uh i

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,920
think gina and wes made a lot of good

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,319
metaphors that i

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
like completely agree with um i think in

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,120
the beginning i was mostly just writing

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,079
code but as the community grows uh

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
you naturally have to deal more with um

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
sort of

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,400
um coordinating efforts in the community

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,880
trying to

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
um make make sure the community is a

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
good one

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,800
it's welcoming and people know where to

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,479
go to ask questions and

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,280
uh so a lot of um community maintenance

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,880
uh and uh but still a lot of code to

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
write as well

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
so a lot of code writing maybe but also

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
a lot of

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,800
sort of managing people managing the

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,000
project and being a kindergarten teacher

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
of of all the things so um i know

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,320
all of you had very interesting journeys

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
how would you describe a typical journey

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,120
from consumer to contributor to

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
maintainer

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
in open source and gina let's start this

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,600
one with you

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
i think mine is probably a pretty

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,600
typical one so the way that i got

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
heavily interest

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
into open source was that back in 2012 i

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
got myself a 3d printer

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
and it was sitting in my office

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,160
producing noises producing fumes and i

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
just wanted

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
it wanted it out of my office again and

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
still be able to

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
monitor it remotely so i had this itch

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,840
that i needed to scratch so i scratched

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
it

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,199
wrote a piece of software to do all that

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
for me and

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
ended up with an open source project on

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
my hands because apparently a lot of

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,440
people had the same itch

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,280
and i just had scratched it for them

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,560
and evan what was your journey from

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
consumer to maintainer

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,560
man it's almost the same again because i

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
always also scratched my own itch

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,320
i was working on these very uh projects

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,400
with very fast turnaround

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,479
and i was like uh i want a very uh

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
smooth framework that you know fits my

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,560
mental model

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
that i can feel productive with so i

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,639
essentially wrote my own and turns out a

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,360
lot of other people liked it too

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,120
so it kind of grew into this thing today

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,199
so this is interesting you start with

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,039
the project that you care about and then

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,000
eventually the community comes and joins

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
you and it grows into

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,080
a full-blown framework that people have

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
conferences about that's so cool

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
um so in terms of this is a very

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,080
interesting question because

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,120
i think people have arguments about this

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
all the time but

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,240
what's the importance of known cod node

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,600
non-code oh my god um contributions

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,880
to your particular project and wes would

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,960
i would like to start this with you

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,000
yeah i mean non-code contributions are

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,400
are extremely

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
important and i would say highly highly

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
underrated

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
uh one of the things that i spend the

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
most time doing as a contributor and a

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
maintainer is is

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
you know gardening the issue tracker so

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
organizing

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
the reports that come in getting more

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,120
information from the from the issue

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
reporters

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
closing out duplicates connecting issues

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,759
together

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
setting their metadata because

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
ultimately a project that is that is

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,360
well organized and and where

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
we have as much information as possible

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
about the the bug reports of the future

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
requests that come in

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,680
is going to make it that much easier for

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,800
people to jump in and make

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
uh and make contributions um and very

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
little of that process

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,960
you know results in pull requests or uh

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,160
commits landing in in the main branch so

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
it's it's very very important

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,560
and evan in terms of non-call

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
contributions to vue.js what do you

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
think

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
oh definitely um non-code contributions

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
i would say

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
are equally critical compared to code

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
contributions

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,240
uh like documentation is very important

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,479
uh the thing is when you when you

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
contribute to documentation it ends up

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,160
being this shared knowledge that

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,520
benefits everyone that comes after you

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,800
uh and also community engagement uh

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,720
say event organizers meetup organizers

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
conference organizers they also do a

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
great service to the community by

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,440
connecting people together

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,879
so so i think yeah like these type of

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
contributions are

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,720
uh quite important in terms of where vue

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,960
is at today

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,560
as a conference organizer i'm really

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
happy to hear that

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
but do you know in terms of non-color

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,120
contributions to your project what

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,760
what are your thoughts on that

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
uh yeah i think they uh contributions

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,959
like that are

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,479
utterly crucial especially for projects

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,680
like mine like octoprint who are more

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,640
end user facing

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
because the problem we face i think in

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,600
general as

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
maintainers is that we have this very

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
very strict point of view on our code

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
which is very technical in nature with

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,600
the architecture and and all the

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,760
all the details all the technical

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,800
details in our head and this

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
pretty much disqualifies us from writing

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,120
good

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,519
and user-facing documentation whereas

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
your regular run-of-the-mill user who

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,200
does not even necessarily know how to

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,360
write code is absolutely

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,360
present to to be able to help here and

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
it would be wonderful if more people

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
found the courage to actually do that

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
and yeah so i i really welcome non-code

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
contributions

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,240
in in my open source project all the

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,959
time i love it when it happens

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,480
so actually newbies have a very

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
important role to play

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
in writing code documentation is what

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
i'm hearing and

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
that is super encouraging and again i

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,600
would encourage

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,360
anybody who wants to start contributing

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
to open source to start with the docs

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
because

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
i think this is a very easy way to get

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
started

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,839
and um kath actually our our host for

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
today actually just went through the

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
journey of open sourcing github docs

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
which enables the whole community to

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,480
collaborate with us

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,600
on that work for helping

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
everybody so um in terms of your

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,200
community

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,440
have you ever experienced anyone

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
becoming toxic to the community

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,680
and what do you do if that happens

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,519
do you know let's start with you

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,240
uh sadly i have and uh yeah well

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
my usual approach in cases like that is

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,399
to

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,399
first and foremost tell them when they

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
are crossing certain kind of boundaries

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,240
and are becoming toxic so for example

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
when they start calling people names or

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
just are going

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,360
starting to show some kind of attitude

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,200
that is not

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
yeah let's say not productive to the

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,839
whole discussion and all that

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
um and usually simply telling them that

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,279
they

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,640
are crossing a boundary here and are

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,640
doing something that is not welcome

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
will either make them go away or make

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
them apologize and become a good citizen

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,320
of course that is not always the case

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,720
but at least so far my experience with

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
this

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,800
approach has been fairly good

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,440
and evan how do you deal with toxic

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,640
people

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,680
yeah i think um there are two types of

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,640
uh toxic cases i think like

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,279
for example one k one type is uh some

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
random user just being really rude in a

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,760
github issue

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,399
or a pull request and in those cases

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
i mean i i kind of gotten used to it uh

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
if they

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,279
repeatedly do this or just block them

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,480
thanks to the block feature

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,320
um but if this is some more a public

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
incident where you know a lot of people

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
are uh

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
getting exposed to then we'll have to

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,760
essentially investigate it and enforce

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,839
the code of conduct very strictly

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
and wes what about you in terms of toxic

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,160
members of community

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
i've been uh i've been lucky to not have

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,639
to deal with it uh too often but in

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,320
in the handful of instances um you know

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,120
i think it's it's very important to to

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
bring people

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
you know back to your code of conduct

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
and what we you know deemed to be

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
good behavior in the project to say very

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,360
you know very firmly like we don't do

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,519
that here

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
but i think it's also important you know

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,519
to understand you know some of the

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
you know what causes the the toxic

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
behavior sometimes it's

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,639
somebody is really frustrated or has

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
been you know some is frustrated by

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
something in the project

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
and they're just not dealing with it in

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,920
in the right way so i think it's also

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,320
helpful to

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,240
you know to empathize with with the with

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
the toxic actor and say look look i

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,600
understand that you're upset about this

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,120
thing or you're upset about something

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,399
but this is not the way to deal with it

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,920
and like we're all working here with

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
good intentions and like let's work

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,079
together

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,040
to solve the problem we don't need to

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,040
call each other names

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,240
it's i read it recently somewhere about

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
like

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
toxic behavior is about setting

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
boundaries right so it's not just about

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
the pers the toxic person being toxic

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,600
it's also about you telling them this

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,040
behavior is not accepted

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
here um so i i feel like we all know the

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,440
answer to this question

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,440
but have you ever experienced burnout

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,200
and what's your strategy to deal with

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,200
that and wes let's get us started

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
yeah i mean i cert i certainly have you

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
know having been involved in

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,399
in open source for over 10 years now i

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,279
mean i think it it

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,040
ultimately is is comes from your desire

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,480
like my desire and other people's desire

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,399
to make you know to make an impact so

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,079
you care so much about

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,279
uh this project and this community that

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
you're involved with that it's

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,240
inevitable that

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
uh it will that there will be end up

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,200
being more work than you can personally

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,200
handle and so you're

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,480
rather than choosing uh you know what

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
you're successful at it feels like

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,279
you're choosing you know what you're

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,120
going to fail at and so

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,360
um and you're also exposed to a lot of

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,040
negative one-sided negative feedback

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,880
about the project bug reports and

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
performance regressions and people being

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,800
frustrated about different things and so

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,320
um you know it's important to remind

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
yourself that that you know project

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
can't succeed or fail on the basis of

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,399
the efforts of one person and so you

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
have to you know forgive yourself

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,680
and make some space and make sure you're

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,480
taking care of yourself

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,240
uh mentally and physically um and trust

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
that that uh you know trust that the

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,639
community will uh

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,199
um that will we'll step in to to uh to

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,199
do what

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,880
uh what needs to be done uh you know

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,040
take care of the most important parts of

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,760
the project

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,839
reducing the bus factor right um evan

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,040
what about you in terms of managing

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,680
burnout yeah i've definitely been

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
through

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
you know phases where i seriously

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
question

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,639
why i'm not doing this but um i think a

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,560
lot of the stress

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,000
comes from just this constant influx of

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,320
problems that people are telling you

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,760
with and where maintainers are

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,760
like exposed or like major majorly to

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,079
these negative information

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,680
so uh i think one of the tricks i did is

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,920
i essentially started

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,959
pulling instead of being pushed these

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
information

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,720
uh so i try to you know have a pretty

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,519
strict work

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,600
hours only look at emails when i want to

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,839
only look at issues when i want to

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
instead of you know whenever an issue

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,880
comes in i'm going to rush to solve it

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
that's just not sustainable it's also

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,920
totally fine to just take some time off

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,160
to recharge

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,839
i think sometimes i just you know feel

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,959
don't feel like working i'll just take a

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,839
week off um

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,199
that's the good part about working for

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,760
yourself

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,399
it's yeah i i feel like especially for

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,199
people who

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
manage to be full-time open source

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
maintainers

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,920
it sort of becomes the same thing as

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
managing your full-time job right

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,519
remember to take vacations as well and

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,759
don't think that you always have to be

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,079
available whenever someone has a problem

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
um gina i happen to know your answer to

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,959
this question but what do you do

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
to manage burnout

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,959
yeah i mean in my case uh it pretty much

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
boils down to

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
what uh evan already also said about

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,079
very strict work

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,320
life balance and very strict working

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,759
hours uh but i also do have a punching

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
bag in my office

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,240
and uh that also helps a lot when

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,079
everything just becomes too much and i

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
need to let off some steam

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,040
and in general i think being a

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,920
maintainer is like it's a long-term

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,560
commitment right

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,240
and we want to do our job well for a

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,360
long time so i think it's really really

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,519
important that we

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
also make it part of our job to take

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,639
good care of ourselves because probably

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
no one else will

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,399
and that means obviously also taking

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
vacations allowing ourselves sick days

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,399
off

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,680
and all that so yeah just basically

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
full agreement to everything that's

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,399
already been said

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,440
so i think after watching this stream it

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,920
may be that a lot of people are going to

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
buy punching bags and install them in

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,680
their offices right now

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,759
especially with all the you know virtual

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,079
stuff going on and where you can't

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
actually vent to real human beings

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
around you

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,199
um so i got another question which is

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,279
how can the community help you help you

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
manage work hours help you manage

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,399
burnout and help you kind of have

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,920
positive experiences

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,360
around your open source project and gina

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,959
let's start with you um

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,639
evan already gave an example of this

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,880
that we usually

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,799
primarily see the negative things and

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,799
only hear the negative stuff and

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,120
this is also something that i observe

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,880
with octoprint there's this huge silent

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,400
majority that is completely happy

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
apparently with what i'm doing and then

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
there's this side at this this very

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,439
vocal uh minority

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,439
that whenever something breaks or they

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,480
have a problem they become very

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,640
loud and scream at me um if the

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,880
silent majority became a little little

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,360
bit less silent and just from time to

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
time

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,120
thanked their maintainers i think that

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,799
would go a long way with regards to

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
uh yeah sustainable uh maintenance for

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,600
everyone

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,440
i know that a thank you tweet usually

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,440
makes my day if not my whole week so

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,720
that is awesome and evan uh what about

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
you in terms of people

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,880
helping you manage burnout and other

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,000
things

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,559
uh i think the most validating moments

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,919
were actually at offline events um so

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,200
before the pandemic we had

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,799
quite a few offline conferences uh

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,480
view conferences that i went to

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,919
personally and uh

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
at the after parties people would

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,400
actually come up to me and say thank you

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,919
in person

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
i think those are the moments where i

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,960
felt like this is totally worth it

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,360
you know all the work paid off um

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,160
unfortunately we can't do this anymore

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
uh

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
at least for now but uh i really hope

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
like we can you know get a chance to do

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,480
that more

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,880
in the future so it sounds like

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,320
some you know we have navigated into

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
virtual world and

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,919
created some alternative to that

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,039
experience so kind of like tweets and

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,400
and uh positive messages right

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,120
um i say let's send your

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,080
favorite open source maintainer a a

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,679
holiday card

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,919
or some money via github sponsors um

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
you all encouraged do that um so

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,919
important question

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,120
uh sort of a good segue into that and

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,000
how did your project

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,200
actually you figure out monetization so

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
gina let's start with you

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,760
i'm actually not sure if i really have

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
figured it out i figured it out or if

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,160
there is

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
anything specific to figure it out

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,360
figure out right because there is no

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,960
code to crack or something like that in

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,840
my case it was

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,880
i i i had to somehow find a way to

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
continue to

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,120
work on octoprint full-time and so i

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,520
tried crowdfunding it

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
it worked in my case at least so far but

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
it could also just as well not have

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,799
worked and

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
i sometimes get question from people who

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,720
also try to do that

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
like if i have any tips for them and i i

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,039
usually just track my my shoulders

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,400
uh because i i don't know i i think

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,240
there is no real

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,840
do this and then you will have success

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,320
kind of recipe there

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,320
it's just yeah hoping for the best

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,720
yeah i and then again i think everyone

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
on this panel was able to

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,280
take open source's full-time job which

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,960
is i think many people are striving for

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,760
um and what about you in terms of

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,400
monetization

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,440
um so so first of all i think every

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
project is different

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
in terms of monetization it's like a

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,200
thousand open source projects is like a

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,640
thousand startups with completely

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,640
different business models

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,400
so you kind of have to think of if you

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
want to monetize the project you kind of

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
have to think

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
about it from a you know a product

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,559
perspective what are the values people

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,159
are getting out of it and how can you

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,200
sort of funnel that back into the

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,960
project

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,200
um so specifically for vue uh

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
it's it's simply because we have so many

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
users that we

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,400
we figure out you know i'm mostly doing

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,159
crowdfunding as well

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
uh and because view is a pretty high

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
exposure project but

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,720
that might not work for certain types of

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,520
projects

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,120
uh so that that as gina said there is

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,400
really no universal code

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,960
that applies to everything

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,760
unfortunately right but we're trying to

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,159
figure out

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,919
um so wes what about you in terms of

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,840
figuring out monetization for your

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,840
favorite project

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,880
oops wes it looks like wes muted um

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,000
was i apologize all right um

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
i had some construction in the

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,440
background i in in the past i've relied

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
on uh work you know

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
working on open source projects as part

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
of my job but uh in recent times uh

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,640
i've been fortunate to have uh corporate

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,720
uh industry sponsorships and for me it's

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,360
really been about articulating that that

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,600
uh

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,440
that it makes sense to to to fund the

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,520
development because they're investing

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,360
in the ecosystems that they that they

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,360
depend on and enabling the

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,360
the contributors and maintainers to do

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
their uh to do their best work

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,280
and i think so again and we announced

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
the

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,919
corporate sponsors corporate sponsors at

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,600
this conference and i think

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,760
i hope that this is going to be really

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,320
helpful because now enterprise companies

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
can

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,919
support open source maintainers for

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,120
projects that they rely on

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,039
through their existing building

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,679
relationships with github which should

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,679
make it

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
a lot easier for certain in certain

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
cases um

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,960
so i i guess we are coming up on on

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,120
talking about the

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,840
important part of this conversation

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,880
which is trying to predict the future so

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,039
um what do you all think in terms of

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
what do we have to look forward to in

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,280
open source for the next few years

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,200
and what what is the most important part

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,039
about the open source future and

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,039
wes let's get started with you

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,559
yeah well my my perspective is that a

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,159
lot of the a lot of the innovation

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,159
that's occurred over the over the last

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,799
10 years has been the result of

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,559
uh basically super heroics from like a

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,280
very small number of

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,880
um of a relatively small number of

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
volunteers and so

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,520
the next stage of innovation and open

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,919
source is going to require a lot more

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,280
a lot more effort and a lot more people

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,840
and a lot more funding

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,520
and so if we want to enable the

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
ecosystem to continue to innovate it's

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,960
going to require

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,559
a significantly more funding um in

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
particular you know enabling more people

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,039
to work full-time on open source

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
projects

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
uh to make their their work more

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
sustainable to have less

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,320
you know less contributor and maintainer

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,320
uh you know maintainer burnout

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,840
so i'm hopeful that we can i think there

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
there's been progress on solving some of

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,960
these problems

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
i hope to see uh you know greater

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,600
government level funding for

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,360
open source uh to enable uh more more

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,400
and more people to uh to make open

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,400
source their career

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,000
and i think sort of i will plug in with

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,559
something that uh we've had a lot of

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,279
discussions about in the last few days

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,960
which was like

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
open source is open source it's not

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,640
necessarily free right we still have

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
people working on open source

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,080
contributing to it every day

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,400
and those people got to eat something

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,960
and these people got to get funded and

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,760
so

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,039
uh just being entitled like acting

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,279
entitled to

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,159
i have all the open source software in

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,360
the world for free

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,120
doesn't really help the maintainers um

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,919
evan what about you what do you envision

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,960
for the future of open source

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,080
yeah i think um a trend in the recent

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,720
years is you see

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,240
the rise of a lot of these projects

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,880
that's mainly driven by

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,520
individuals or small teams instead of

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
these

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,520
traditionally enterprise sponsored kind

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,320
of huge projects

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,000
uh even cross-company collaborations uh

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,559
and the importance of these

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
small individual projects are becoming

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
more prominent but at the same time we

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
haven't really figured out

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,039
the you know the the monetization and

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,279
sustainability of those

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,559
this type of projects and i think one

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,880
important aspect for that

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,760
is the financial infrastructure to make

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,600
it easier for

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,480
individuals to to just fund their oss

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,440
uh which you know this kind of resource

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,440
big companies

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,200
have access to but individuals it's a

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
hurdle that they have to jump over

00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,760
themselves

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
and if if we can have you know a

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,679
financial infrastructure that just

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
you know reduces the friction for people

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,360
to do this kind of stuff

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
i think it'll help a lot in the future

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,200
uh like efforts like open collective

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,440
and github sponsors i think are good

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,440
efforts in this direction

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
awesome and gina what about you in terms

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,320
of future of open source

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,610
yeah i'm pretty much agreeing with both

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,120
of the both of you um

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,400
[Music]

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,240
the thing is in my opinion oh uh

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
yeah sponsoring or donating to open

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,240
source for for users

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
not for companies but for users is still

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,799
very very

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
even more niche than for companies let's

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
say like that uh if you for example look

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,480
at

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,360
people like like youtube or twitch

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,320
streamers

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
it's it's way more normalized by now to

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,679
sponsor

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,039
those people for for adding value to

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,039
people's lives

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,880
and what i would really like to see

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,840
within the next five to ten years

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,520
is uh yeah some kind of of com community

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,200
shift also happening in that regard that

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,640
this becomes also more normal in the

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,279
open source community

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
because uh like evan said we have way

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,919
more

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,440
small projects with that add a lot of

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
value but are

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
helped by only a very very small amount

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
of people

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,240
and those people like you said sasha do

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,799
have to eat so it would be really great

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,480
if

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,400
yeah in five or ten years when we meet

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,120
again we can say hey

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,120
that worked out

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,240
yes so so i think that like there's a

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,799
similar vein coming from everybody and

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
that is

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,480
that we could have all the innovation in

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,320
the world powered by millions of people

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,760
collaborating on things right but we do

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,000
have to figure out the way

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,320
to fund this community effort as well to

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,360
enable people to essentially keep doing

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
the good work

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,840
um so we're coming up on time and uh

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,520
for closing i would like to just ask you

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,679
each one of you to say

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,760
um how would you encourage your

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,679
community to better support

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,039
your open source their open source

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,240
maintainers today

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,919
and let's start with wes

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,360
yeah i mean once one small thing you can

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,919
do is to talk to your

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,279
talk to your managers about how you can

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,200
allocate budget to

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,279
to support open source projects it could

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,840
be you know something like larger budget

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,200
items

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,799
like larger sponsorships or even

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,000
something so simple as every engineer

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,919
having an allowance for

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
monthly allowance for github sponsors so

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,279
you can choose

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,000
which which projects you you want to you

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,520
want to sponsor

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,520
and evan yeah i would

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,799
really recommend anyone interested in

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,840
this topic read

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,559
this book by nadia ingbao

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,480
it's called working in public and it

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,960
talks a lot about this

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,960
this rise of small scale open source

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,640
projects that i was talking about and i

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,559
think

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,559
it touches on a lot of good points

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,320
thank you and i happen to know that our

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,600
host just got this book so i guess

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,840
everybody's going to be reading the same

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
book over the holidays um

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,039
and gina in terms of uh you know

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,200
supporting your open source maintainers

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,200
what what can how can the community help

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,200
i would just like to reiterate that

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,960
every kind of contribution is valuable

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,039
don't think that just because you cannot

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,399
code or don't yet know how to code you

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,000
cannot contribute to an open source

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,200
project your point of view

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,200
is valuable and we want to have it

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,360
thank you so much thank you to all of

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,679
