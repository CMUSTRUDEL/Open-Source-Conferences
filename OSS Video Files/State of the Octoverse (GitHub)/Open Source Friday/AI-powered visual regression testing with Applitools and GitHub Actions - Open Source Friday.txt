gregor was last week

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
uh talking about open source maintenance

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,800
and management of your repos

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080

or maybe october i'm not sure when we

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
first met

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,079
online um but yeah you just recently

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
took a new role um

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,280
at apple tools but rather than me

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,399
explain what you do

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
and why you're here why don't you

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
introduce yourself yeah sure so i'm

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
colby fayak i'm a developer

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
advocate at appletools so i work closely

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
with the developer community

00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
trying to do things like building

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
integrations and

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,960
content that really speaks towards like

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,879
the technical uh

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,159
aspects of things and how to get apple

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
tools up and running

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
um but generally speaking like i also

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,880
focus on building

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
like educational content for things like

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,600
react next.js and general javascript and

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
i love github actions which is you know

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
why i'm here and i'm not just saying

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
that because i'm on here but

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
yeah that's me in a nutshell yeah i

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,759
personally love github actions as well

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,680
if you know me from the internet um i'm

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,000
b doug eo i don't know if i need to uh

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,360
explain myself or introduce myself but

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
um yeah i've been working on a lot of

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
action content in the last month

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
and uh what i love is that we're gonna

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,240
be talking about your action

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,759
today but before we jump in uh i just

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
want to mention everybody this is live

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,439
we are streaming on twitch twitch.tv

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
github if you happen to be watching a

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,360
youtube video um

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
we cannot allow any url so if you drop a

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
url into the chat uh it will get blocked

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,880
and you'll get uh basically

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,880
auto banned for 60 seconds so um

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
appreciate it someone was put put the

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
put my shoe on the head which

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
i'm actually wearing socks i have no

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,799
shoes inside so it's just

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,320
it's a family rule but uh maybe colby

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
will put an issue on his head

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
um but also mention we do have a code of

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,400
conduct so definitely look down below

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
in the description if you are well well

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,360
definitely take a look at that if you

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
have not got yourself up to speed with

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
that

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
um because we want to make sure

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
everything is nice and

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,720
friendly and comfortable with everybody

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,319
who wants to come through so please

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
be respectful to our guests be

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,599
respectful to people in the chat

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
and also we will be asked answering

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
questions the entire time so if you have

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,239
a question

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
drop in a chat i'll try to grab it a lot

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,280
of times the chat actually answers a

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
question before i can get to it so i'll

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
acknowledge the people who answer the

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,599
questions as well

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
uh and i will do my best to pronounce

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,840
your twitch handle

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
uh it's about the best of my abilities

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
so

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
uh no promises that i get it right um

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
but shout out to uh i'm maple leaf who

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,920
gave me the shoe on the head

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
idea um maybe if i can grab a newspaper

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,239
or something

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
maybe that'll be uh that'll be easier um

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,239
but yeah uh we are gonna be talking

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
about your action uh which is

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,840
apple tools eyes actions um so

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,879
i'm curious do you want to i guess

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,239
actually would it be

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,080
perf would it be better if we talked

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,680
about apple tools first and explain that

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,040
before we jump into this

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,920
yeah sure um so i'll wait till we bring

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,040
that up quick um

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
i'm struggling so there we go so so

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,440
apple tools is

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,599
an automated visual testing uh solution

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,879
um so what we do in like from a really

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
high level point of view

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,040
we come in and we take snapshots

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,599
screenshots of your application

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
and we create a baseline where then

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,799
future

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
test runs will compare those previous

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
screenshots

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,959
um but it's required we've gone from

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,959
pixel by pixel which is pretty common in

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,440
the industry to what we see as a more

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,159
superior solution where we actually

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
use ai to kind of intelligently look at

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
those different screenshots so we can

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
compare

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
not just is a tiny pixel different but

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,720
is there something actually important

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
so that includes things like content

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
regions where you know if you're just

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,120
writing a new blog post maybe you don't

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
want that to flag

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,439
uh the test results but if it's actually

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
something important like the layout and

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,959
the navigation like then you can

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
actually

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,199
because i know sometimes my browsers can

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,880
have different you'll notice the layouts

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
because of maybe firefox and they're how

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
they do css

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,240
yeah absolutely so there's a solution we

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
have called ultrafast test grid which

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
it's pretty easy to add a bunch of

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
different browsers into your

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
configuration

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,199
that'll stack up and run through all

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,720
these different browsers and even like

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,479
native and mobile apps

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
so you can cover you know not just

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,960
browsers but a ton of different use

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
cases

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
so make sure that your product is fully

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,880
covered

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
okay excellent yeah it looks like we

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
were actually uh playing the uh

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,080
apple tools audio in the background for

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,639
everybody while you were talking so

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,600
hopefully the uh everybody got exactly

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,240
what apple tools was

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
all about uh we can we can move on for

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
that if not

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
there's a great video that i i'm more

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
than happy to drop in the chat too as

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,280
well so i'll drop that

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
uh but do you want to explain um

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,199
well while you're here you want to

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,280
explain the apple tools eyes action so

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
um most people actually in the chat just

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,840
let us know if you're familiar with

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,160
github actions we can go back and

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
talk about that but for now why don't we

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,600
talk about uh

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,600
apple tools eyes action yeah sure so

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,520
i'll first start off like we have a ton

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
of different sdks that

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,360
integrate directly into like

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
pre-existing workflows so if i'm using

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
cypress or selenium

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,520
or even storybook like we have an sdk

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
that can easily fit into that and

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
you know mostly just work once you

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
configure that but i also wanted to play

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
around with the idea of what if we can

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
come up with something like a github

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
action where if we just drop that right

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,080
into your workflow file

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,039
it'll you know quote just work and it'll

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
go out and

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,800
you know scrape your or not scrape your

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,639
content but take snapshots of your

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,840
website in your application and

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,440
be able to give you that coverage

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,039
without really putting in a lot of hard

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,960
work because you know some people

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,800
might not have a testing solution or

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,720
maybe they don't want to pile

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
another library on top of that so this

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
is this is another way to do that

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
um the way that i'm kind of approaching

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
that is

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
this kind of first iteration that i put

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,199
together is

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
what it'll do is it'll take that base

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,600
url that you can see in the snippet

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
there

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,720
and it'll actually crawl your site so

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
there's a

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,639
npm package called i think it's like

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,840
sitemap generator where it'll go through

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,160
in node it'll

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,080
crawl your website yeah i think it's

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,919
sitemap generator

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
but it'll create crawl your website

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,479
it'll create that sitemap file

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,199
uh which is a pretty common format and

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,919
then inside of the action i use cypress

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,840
to spin up the to spin up a browser and

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,240
run through each of those urls and take

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,240
a snapshot with apple tools um

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
so the snapshots are really simple i

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,199
plan to add more configurations because

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
there's a lot you can do with apple

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
tools rather than just you know

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,319
like i was saying before ai and ai

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
powered and

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
as opposed to just simple pixel by pixel

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,599
snapshots but you know i'm going to keep

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,919
adding on to this and

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
be able to build new features another

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,440
thing you can

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
pass in your own sitemap file so say you

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
don't want it to just crawl every single

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
web

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
page on your website you can pass in

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,360
your own sitemap.xml file or even

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
one of the other plans i have you know

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
given that i'm big in the jam stack

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,880
space i want to be able to take

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
a static directory so say somebody can

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
come in here and instead of

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
providing a base url or a sitemap url

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
they can provide

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,400
a static directory where we can see that

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,400
we can scrape all the

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
html files in there and then we can spin

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
up a local server and run through that

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,759
so it's just giving more options for

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
somebody to be able to

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,680
drop this in into any workflow as an

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
action and get up and running with

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
visual

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,800
testing yeah i love this and um i

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
want to shout myself out one more time

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
but uh i spent the last month in

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,120
february doing 28 days of github actions

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
uh because i happen to be doing tons of

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,280
github action work and

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
the one thing i love about what you just

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
explained

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,039
but you wouldn't way more detailed than

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,639
i even have gotten to

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
so like if you look at my post you won't

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,680
get that much detail uh so

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
that's definitely thanks for everybody

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
for showing up and getting that sort of

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
experience

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
that was a deep high level overview

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,879
right deep high level overview exactly

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
also i got some dependencies i need to

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,440
update

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,800
um but i bring this up because i've got

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,440
this action that i use

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
um and i'll get to a point real quick

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,199
and what's up marco welcome

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
in the chat um i've got this lighthouse

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,560
action and it actually looks at the

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
netlify deploy preview

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,599
uh directly because nullified you get a

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,159
predicted uh deploy preview url which

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
appends the uh the branch name and the

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,760
name of the site

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
so you can predict that so what this

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,720
action does it actually

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,880
does a lighthouse ci check um

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,200
directly in the pr and within their

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,040
action runner and i love that so much

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
and i wanted to do that similarly for

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
like my versailles appointments as well

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
as my get up pages but

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
well github pages will work because it's

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
predictive url but i haven't built that

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
yet

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
but when you talk about the sitemap

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,959
generator and using cypress to

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
kind of build that and exp not the

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,200
experience what i'm talking about

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,560
the environment um now that it's

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
clicking in my head of like if i wanted

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
to rebuild that experience that's not

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,880
just netlify specific

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
i could build that for any sort of

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
experience using things like cypress as

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,839
well

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
yeah and it's interesting i i probably

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
want to look at your lighthouse thing

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
and borrow ideas from there and

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
yeah back and forth because like

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,160
ultimately i wanted i wanted to be able

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
to have it so you can configure it

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,320
you know however you want but you don't

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
have to go out of your way to do those

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
those types of things so um you know

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
again just so it just works when you

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,880
drop it in with whatever your

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,560
project solution is yeah yeah and um

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
speaking of just works i know we're kind

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
of racing through the uh the

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,080
conversation but

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,880
i kind of want to see it just work um so

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
you had mentioned

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,880
before we started that you had a quick

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,640
demo to be able to show

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,959
yeah sure um did you want to uh so

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,120
if you go to my github and i think if

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,079
you literally just inside of the url put

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,600
the word test

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,760
in front of or yeah that works

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
i was going to say test in front of the

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
uh repo name

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,279
so so test apple tools eyes actions

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,440
uh that's great naming convention it was

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
unintentional but it works pretty well

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
it's not forgettable at this point yeah

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,560
so i think we can

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,160
first of all pull up the workflows file

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,240
yeah and we can see so

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,320
here i have i think i have yeah three

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
different examples the first one

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
um so what this is gonna do every time a

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
new

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,320
every time somebody pushes a commit up

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,680
to main or a new pull request

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,519
a targeting main it's going to fire this

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
action and what it's going to do

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,160
is it's going to in this first one it's

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,000
simply going to take the top level url

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,640
and run a screenshot on that and the

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
reason by default it only does the top

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
level one is

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,279
as you can imagine if you're crawling a

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
site that can get really big

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,480
so i want to try to control that so that

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
if somebody's just trying it out they

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,079
don't you know unintentionally ddos

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,600
themselves or something where does the

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,600
where's the specifically grab the top

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,399
level is it this right here

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
the base url yeah so it'll just if if it

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
doesn't have

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,160
a defined depth it's going to just

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,680
simply

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
use that and then use that for the

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
visual testing

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
but then as you see in the second

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,640
example i have a max depth defined

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,760
and so what that'll do is it'll find

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,160
any link on that top level page

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
and it'll also provide visual testing on

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,880
each of those links

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,760
um i think it might be domain specific i

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
can't remember

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,240
uh i would imagine so but that way it's

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
only going one level deep so it's still

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
going to grab a lot of

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
value off of that site map but it's not

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
still going to be super deep

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
but that's configurable you can really

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,560
set it up to do whatever you want um

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,160
it's just of course that's going to

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,959
scale the more you have

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,720
more pages to your site but then finally

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
at the end there i just have another

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
simple example where

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
you're providing your own sitemap file

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,639
um you know sitemap files are really

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,040
common

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,360
so like people specifically maintain

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,959
those to whatever their preference is so

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,600
maybe you just want to pass that in and

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,440
only have those pages checked out

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
but either way whatever the option is

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
it'll

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,880
grab that and it'll run the test now i'm

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,720
curious if you're actually able to see

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
the logs on your end

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,800
um if you wanted to try going up to the

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
actions tab

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,399
like you can see all the workflow runs

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
yeah i should be able to see

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
the logs yep cool are you able to click

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,560
into i think

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,279
uh it should be this one yeah

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,880
cool so what it's doing here you can see

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,160
it's spinning up cyprus

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,320
and that's where it's starting to run

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,600
the visual test so in this example here

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
we see some

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,720
green check mark and then a few red

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
flags what that saying

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
is when it visited that page and

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
provided a visual snapshot

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
it found a difference in that page and

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
it's flagging it so that we know that we

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
can look inside the apple tools

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
dashboard and figure out what that

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
change was

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,040
um oh nice

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,120
yeah am i able to click this i need to

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,200
have access to your um

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
oh yeah so that's so that's probably one

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,959
of the reasons why this one fails

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,320
because it was a 404

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,680
i think i haven't ran it on this

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
specific one in a while and i just ran

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
it this morning just to get a

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,800
um you know something that we can show

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
off but it's a good use case because you

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
know yeah it failed and it's something

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,519
that would flag in apple tools yeah and

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,000
it's a good thing it's a good use case

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,519
to find

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
like if sometimes we name things

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,880
actually i'm going through oh i just hit

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,279
my mic but apologies for that

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
uh i'm going through some updates in the

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,079
github hackathon site right now

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,560
and that's the thing i've mentioned

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,720
before on the stream and on the internet

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,480
but um like we're changing the names of

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
different files and different

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
pages and at the moment it's a grid some

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
maps so it uses static site generations

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,320
to develop those things

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,680
but very easily we're renaming things

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,639
and finding that like

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,920
things are broken um so like if you

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
happen to make a lot of changes or you

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,519
take a lot of contributions

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,639
from the team uh it's nice to be able to

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,320
get another

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,920
check to see where where things sort of

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,600
fall over and break

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,279
and it's funny it that was totally like

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
again it was another unintentional

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,920
benefit

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
like because of course like being able

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,040
to provide visual testing

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
gives that capability but i never

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,519
connected it as to also broken pages

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,760
because that's

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
you know that's realistically uh going

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
to be an issue for

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,560
projects yeah unfortunately it's an

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,560
issue for a lot of my projects

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,160
but so this example was the one where it

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
was actually passing in the

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,920
html file now i don't know if you want

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
to click the depth

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
job on the left i don't know if that

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,839
actually will show logs for the site

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
crawling because that might be

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,120
interesting

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,360
um no so it looks like it didn't but

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,279
um so in this example though this is

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,120
where i actually crawled

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
the website if you remember with that

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
parameter of

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,120
two levels deep so if you scroll up just

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,320
slightly there to the

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,160
to the page logs those are that's visual

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
checking all those different pages that

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,519
were a link

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,279
on that top level page so it's it's

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,199
automated i don't have to

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,360
worry about maintaining it anytime i add

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,279
a page to site it's automatically going

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,800
to get grouped into that

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:17,199
the testing complete side note

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,880
why space jelly uh so that's just uh one

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
of my websites that i maintain i

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,199
i put like some tutorials on there and

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
uh space jelly you know this is

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
completely

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,079
non-related to any of this stuff but

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
yeah um so

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,079
uh i i've always thought jellyfish are

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,360
cool and i really like space and i gave

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,600
my friend that idea

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,120
for to like commission a logo kind of

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
thing and that's what he came up with

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,079
and i fell in love with it

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
um shout out to trevor lang if you're

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
watching but

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
um i love it nice yeah i love it uh i

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,079
love

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,160
uh applying um

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,680
a nice cute character to the stuff that

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
you're working on um

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,480
which like for the most part like you

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,160
could be as boring as me and have

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
now i'm just like basically flexing my

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
all my stuff

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,279
but you can have like uh just a straight

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,480
up here's a website and here's some code

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,480
or you could do space jelly yeah

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,759
yeah i i thought it was pretty cute and

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
uh you know i

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,880
i think it really i don't know i just

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,480
thought it was fun and i wanted

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,000
something fun to put out there

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
yeah yeah sounds good sorry as you can

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,759
see i like it i told him purple

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,680
yeah but actually speaking on that note

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,000
you not only um

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,399
so yeah we'll go back to big back to the

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
apple tools real quick

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
but i wanted to actually just bring up

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,959
the point that you actually have a lot

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,920
of content

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
uh uh around github action so like you

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,120
got this together

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
pretty quick because you've only been at

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
apple tools what

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
less than six months um which is like

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,759
yeah very impressive that we have this

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,120
git of action that we can actually drop

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
like basically drop in um apple tools

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
into our sites which

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
i do want to do in the future um but can

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,600
we talk about some other your other

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,040
github action content and sort of your

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
experience with github actions as a

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,279
whole

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,320
sure absolutely um yeah so like i have

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,000
my content

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
specifically but i can also talk again

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,520
about another apple tool

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,640
use case and not just to pull over there

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,959
because i think it's interesting

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
yeah um so getting to the content in a

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,919
second but another use case that we're

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,799
using it for with apple tools which i

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
find really

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,319
uh interesting is um as you might like

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
be aware like when you're helping build

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,520
developer integrations and stuff you

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,039
want to ultimately provide like examples

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,959
for those integrations and

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,640
so for instance with apple tools we have

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,080
different tutorials where we

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
show off how you do it with cypress

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,640
selenium et cetera et cetera and

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,320
i as i kind of inherited maintaining

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
that like i realized that

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,679
kind of keeping up with all those

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
changes and you know as the sdk changes

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,840
as

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,039
other libraries like those things tend

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,039
to break right so

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,640
how can i come up with a way where it's

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,520
automatically checking every time every

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,039
time dependent

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,039
bugs me how can i make sure that it's

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,240
still working so i was able to use

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,080
github actions where

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,080
now anytime there's a pull request

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
anytime there's a security pull request

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,840
it's going to run through those tests

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,960
and make sure that the sdk is still

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,640
working properly

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,960
and further on that we're also going to

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
come up with uh another use case where

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
we're going to

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
i think we're going to run like a daily

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,160
cron where we're going to try to upgrade

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
the packages

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
so um that way we can always pull in the

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,440
latest version of the sdk and making

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,280
sure that it's still working with the

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
examples and again it's just

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,120
this is providing like a maintenance

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,240
layer that i don't have to worry about

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
when we're trying to make sure that

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,880
these examples are always working

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
yeah i'd be curious of how you are using

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,440
actions to pull in

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,160
packages to maintain those sdks

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
so i have uh we haven't done the upgrade

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,520
portion yet

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,360
but um what my plan is is since you can

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,640
run really any command line scripts my

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,600
idea is that

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,640
i'll run npm install at latest for the

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,880
sdk package

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,240
and then since there's also that i'm

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,919
sure you're aware of the package to

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,120
check the code back in with the

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,559
github by passing in the github token

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,799
like that would be the idea so we would

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
upgrade that package and once it gets

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,000
checked in i would think that that would

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
kick off another example run and make

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
sure

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,320
make sure that that works yeah yeah it's

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
um

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,559
it's a conversation i've actually had a

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,200
couple times with um

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,480
gregor gregor who's actually was just on

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
the stream last week

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,480
um so that's why i asked about using an

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,240
action because a lot of people aren't

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,440
familiar with the this term github apps

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,039
where if i pull up probot

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,039
uh gregor actually maintains this tool

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,640
called probot and the difference between

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,520
github actions and the reason why github

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,360
actions

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
uh is is so nice because it gives all

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
the bells and whistles for free there's

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
no installation

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
uh but with probot you might get some

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,360
limitations

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
uh with github actions and the sort of

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,120
what you can do especially at forks in

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,280
um third-party uh users uh with github

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,200
apps it actually gives

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,960
it once you install the github app it

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
actually gives the

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
permissions to be able to do things like

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,720
maintain uh

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
files even maintain actions so it'd be

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,840
something to

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
look into i mentioned it because if

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,799
anybody's not familiar we do have a

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
playlist of all our previous

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,559
open source friday guest and i'm

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,600
struggling to find gregor's

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,280
specifically gregor's um chat well we

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
actually did talk about this

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
because what he does is he maintains 25

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
different repos

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,159
and those 25 different repos are all

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,280
automated and maintained

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,600
through um through a github app and some

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,400
github actions as well

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,840
so that sounds uh so i i've used i think

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
it's called depth foo before have you

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,919
heard of that one

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,280
it sounds like so every so it's like

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
dependable but more

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
configure configurable so i can set it

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
to like

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
um try to keep up to date uh i think

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,520
with the fu

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,240
uh so yeah okay oh and now i just i'm

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
spelling some weird d e i could double

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
check the spelling but i think that's it

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,799
yeah they're right

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,000
um so like not only will it do security

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
updates uh

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
kind of like the pentabot but this will

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
also like you can set it to every so

00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
often

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,799
it'll create a pull request within a

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
minor update right that way you're kind

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,640
of keeping

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,159
up-to-date dependencies so it's really

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,480
nice yeah i'm guessing it sounds like

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,559
the

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,320
pro bots similar to that no probot's

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,320
actually if you wanted to build this

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,640
um so if you wanted to build your so

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
similar get a back actions you can build

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,520
you have all the pieces to build your

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,559
own integrations interactions with your

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
sdks

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
github uh probiot actually is the sort

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
of

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,120
sort of base layer or the template to be

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,760
able to build depth foo

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
or dependable yeah was actually built on

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,200
probot

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,480
um so that's sort of the um actually the

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
pet bot wasn't built on prologue it was

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
built in ruby

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,720
um but the idea of the same approach

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,320
that they took

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
is similar to like purple which

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
basically gives you all the bells and

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
whistles

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,840
up front so these are some examples

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
that's really cool um but no i was just

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,039
thinking of um

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
of the sort of maintenance too as well

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,799
because i've been working with uh gregor

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,840
on this other thing called octoherd

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,640
and octoherd is the the ability to

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,000
have your scripts so if you wanted to

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,919
run through so outside of just

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,840
dependency management imagine you have a

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,960
template repo

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,559
and you want to basically when you

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,600
update the template you want to update

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,039
all the other repos

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
after the fact that we're based off that

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,280
template um

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
also recently people change their branch

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,480
default names

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,159
imagine going through all your repos

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,240
updating the branch names to whatever

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,080
your default branch protection rules

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,320
it's more of like this is actually more

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
focused on like your settings tab

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,520
and what how you manage your repos in

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,039
the settings or in your github folder so

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,640
yeah it's really neat he was on last

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,480
week to talk about this so he he's like

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,159
next level when it comes to

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,919
managing multiple repos because he kind

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,200
of maintains projects

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,720
on his own um yeah but uh let me drop in

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,799
some links in the chat and then we can

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,360
go back to um

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,640
talking about apple tools because uh

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
actually we didn't go we didn't get into

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,360
the content either

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,360
as well which i i realized

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,880
uh but do you want to quickly talk about

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,000
the sort of your your egghead courses

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,240
and the other content you've been sort

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
of sharing around github actions

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,320
yeah sure so just generally speaking uh

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
when i first kind of learned about

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,159
actions like it took a second for me to

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
kind of make it click like that it's

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
like a ci cd kind of tool that you can

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
really simply use but like once it did

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,679
click like i feel like it just

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
opened up a lot of doors for things that

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,280
you can do right inside

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,039
of your github project rather than

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
leaning on like a bunch of third-party

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
services kind of coming in there which

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,200
you know there's a lot of great third

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,039
party services but i love that i can

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,320
just have this workflow file in there

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,520
um but it also so with my egg head cord

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,919
i think i have where

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,039
it walks you through creating a custom

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,520
github action

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,480
um but then on some of like my youtube

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,000
channel content

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,840
and the uh um yeah we can see that first

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
yeah right there so the automate um

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,279
javascript and github actions

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
so that'll actually walk you through um

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,880
how to create a node scripts and kind of

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
like what i did with my

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
github action for apple tools and it'll

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
actually walk you through

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,320
how you can create one because it's

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,440
really not as bad as it might seem from

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,440
the outside because

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,039
there's a few configuration files but

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,320
ultimately you're running a node script

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
and once you have that node script

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,240
you can really do whatever you want so

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,559
it's it's really powerful

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,640
yeah yeah that's um so are you using a

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
template to build yours are you using

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
the

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
uh the github action toolkit to like

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
what's the

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,240
what's the trick when you start going

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,159
through some of this uh content so i'm

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,679
not familiar with the template part of

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,039
it but i do use the

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,400
uh the github action toolkit um for

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,440
some of like the things like grabbing

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,200
input values and um

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,679
i'm not doing anything crazy yet with it

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,559
but some of the more basic features that

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
you need

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,320
okay and to be clear this is the uh the

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,000
repo that you sourced your interactions

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,080
with for the runners

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,080
yeah yeah so um yeah so like uh setting

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,919
grabbing inputs setting outputs i still

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
haven't found i still haven't put up a

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,559
lot of

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
use cases for outputs yet but um there's

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,520
a lot of great things that you can do

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,960
easy i think i also set up octokid

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,400
itself in one of

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,559
i think i did that in a tutorial or

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,559
something but um that was nice where i

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,919
was able to uh

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,240
i don't think i did it here but using

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,080
octo kit to actually interact with the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
pull requests and such um that was

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,320
pretty helpful but um

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,240
actually that was that was the latest uh

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,640
tutorial on space jelly dot dev actually

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
i i walk you through there also creating

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
a new

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
uh github action please yeah yeah so

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,279
that's where you'll actually spin up

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,799
octokit

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,600
oh very nice yeah i think probably my

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,159
the most fun uh action that i've done so

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,679
far

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,400
it's a pretty simple one but i created

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,440
this uh action template called content

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,520
reminder where

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
so what i'm doing is i'm writing it on a

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
cron where

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,799
i i have a file that where i source all

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,240
my different rss feeds and even just

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,799
like static files where

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,720
um daily this will go out and it'll just

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,320
like fetch a random piece of content and

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,600
send me an email with twilio

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,440
because i'm notoriously horrible for

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,200
tweeting my own content and like i have

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,120
a huge backlog of content right so

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,640
like having that reminder in my inbox is

00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,760
a great way for me to grab that link

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,080
and then go out and tweet it or

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,919
something yeah that's uh that's actually

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,200
pretty genius too as well and uh

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
i didn't know you had this backlog

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,320
content because i don't think i've

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,520
actually explored space jelly uh

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,960
no pun intended uh but uh

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,400
but i knew about the egghead course but

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
yeah you've got some some good stuff

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,720
there and i

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,880
definitely encoura i dropped the links

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,600
as you were talking to as well uh folks

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
definitely check out uh that content if

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,520
you want to get level up on

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,200
github actions um the one thing we

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
didn't do though is i wanted to actually

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
see

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,360
what does it look on on your end for the

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,159
apple tools dashboard because you had

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,919
mentioned

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,279
uh when there's a difference so i don't

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,840
know if you have that uh

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
i know i gave you a share link um but

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,159
i'd love to see what it looks like

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,679
especially at that four or four like

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,000
what what what i would expect if i

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
logged into the dashboard and saw that

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,640
yep sure

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,360
um just pull it up

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,039
okay so you can show whatever you want

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,400
yeah okay cool and then folks if you

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,279
have any questions like about github

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,039
actions

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,799
uh about apple tools just now is the

00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,360
time definitely let us know and uh we're

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,520
happy to

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,279
sort of uh field those and hopefully get

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,200
you an answer

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,880
so like this one particularly so this is

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,720
the apple tools eyes dashboard

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,159
and this is really when you first get

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,760
into the dashboard this is going to show

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
you all your latest uh

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,200
test runs so what that means is uh when

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
brian was

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,399
running the action or when we were

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
looking at the logs like that was one

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,840
test run where it went out and

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,600
viewed the different the differences for

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
the site so in particular here like you

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,200
can see the space really ones where

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,960
it went out and it took a snapshot of

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
the website and you know here

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
there was no so it looks like that was

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,960
the first baseline image but there was

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,360
no differences so

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,880
it you know it's green and it's passing

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
because there's no issues there

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,000
um i think the browser is too wide for

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,000
me here um

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,600
let me refresh the page but let's go to

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,320
you have an amazing amount of tabs too

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,840
as well i know i know

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,200
i need to exit out of here um but

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,279
so i think i just accidentally failed

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
that one myself but besides that point

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,880
um so like if we go to another one where

00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,600
it's actually failing like we can see

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,760
here

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,080
now one thing i want to kind of caveat

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,279
this with is this is not using like

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,200
any of the cool ai tools or like uh

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,559
content regions and stuff but as you can

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,000
see here like we're

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,360
it's showing that difference let me see

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,880
if i can zoom in yeah so like it's

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,440
showing that difference where

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
i i never re-ran these tests and

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,679
approved it after i

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,880
um made some adjustments to the footer

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,520
like here i added

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
more links to the bottom of each blog

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,000
post

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,360
and like changed up how the footer looks

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
so it's flagging that

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
so that i know that it's it's broken

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,720
right

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
now in this event in this case i

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
actually intended it to be that way so

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,760
it's

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
you know i would approve this and i by

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,000
just like hitting this thumbs up here

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,080
um but like if that wasn't the case i

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,039
now have that example where i can say no

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,240
that's not good

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,240
uh that'll go back to uh you know then

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,320
the developer or whoever can go back and

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,159
fix it or you know figure out what we

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,120
need to do to resolve it

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,559
let me see if i have any other examples

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,840
uh yeah helps

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,520
from um yeah so like another one is like

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
we have storybook integration which is

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
like super easy like you just literally

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,320
need to run

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,760
um a single script and it'll go through

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,039
and capture all of your different

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,200
components but here

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,480
um like this is going through and

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
capturing all the different components

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
of a storybook

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,000
and that's all automated like you

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,679
literally don't have to set up anything

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,720
for a storybook integration

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
um what i wanted to also

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,919
show which i don't know if i have a test

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,679
run ultra fast batch okay

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,520
so like in this example you can see the

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,200
os here like where you

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,960
one of the questions earlier was can you

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,520
do different browsers right

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,159
so here in this example like we're doing

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
uh

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,200
here we're doing linux and chrome chrome

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,799
on linux or

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,640
or it looks like this was out of pixel 2

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,320
and we have an iphone x and

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,919
you know we're doing all these different

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,919
uh devices which

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
you know this is this makes it so much

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,960
easier to do cross browser testing so

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,080
that you can have those snapshots and

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
understand where things are

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,760
actually failing um you know in this

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
instance again like there wasn't any

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
issues but if it found something it's

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,120
going to flag that for us

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
and we know that we're you know good to

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
go

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,279
which you know it's not going to provide

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
that level of detail for you if you're

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,960
just doing

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,720
simple like um like imagine if you're

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,399
just doing like you're testing that

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,080
a particular element is there like you

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,840
might be missing the entire context

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,360
that element might be completely off the

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,600
page you don't know that but

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,600
because this is actually what the user

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,080
sees it's going to actually be able to

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,360
compare that really well yeah yeah and i

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
like the fact that the the different

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,000
devices are available for you for

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,240
testing

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
i used to have a pixel before i lost it

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,720
in brazil uh

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,559
long story but i specifically used it so

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,159
i could do some pwa testing and stuff

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,559
like that and uh

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
yeah i i don't want to carry two phones

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,720
ever again because it's hard to keep

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,080
track of

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,919
especially the one that you don't really

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
use uh you only use for

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,120
programming um yeah that's really cool

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,600
to see and i like the

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,880
the fact that you can do that yeah and

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,799
the thing that that's great is

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,240
so coupling it with tools like cypress

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,600
or tools like uh

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
you know anything where you can interact

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,960
with those pages on the browser so

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
um in this instance in this particular

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,640
test case like uh what we're doing is

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,320
inside of cyprus we're clicking on the

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,000
login button now this is just a

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
you know a simple static page that we

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,640
have as the demo but

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,240
we're clicking on this so that it goes

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,679
to this next page so we're actually

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,840
testing those interactions

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,519
not just one-to-one things we're

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,320
actually testing did that login

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,039
request work now imagine that with like

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
end-to-end

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,320
workflows where you want to capture that

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,919
entire process

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,720
and it'll capture all those different

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,720
browsers for that

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,840
excellent yeah appreciate you giving us

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,159
the i guess

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,279
eyes on the uh the apple tools uh

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,279
dashboard too as well

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,720
there we go but can you clarify apple

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,799
tools eyes actually is

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,880
it's a product within apple tools

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,240
yeah so like the i we have the is sdk

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,399
eyes is the product and then

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,000
the ultra fast test skirt is like on top

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,480
of that where it's going to actually go

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
through

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,679
and um provide a lot of the additional

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,080
capabilities on top of it

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,519
excellent and uh there's some questions

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,519
coming in too as well i've

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,600
i want to actually propose this question

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,039
to you which uh does rom

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,960
i think i got that right i think i'm

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,519
gonna if not that's what your name

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,760
should be

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,720
uh where would you say that uh github

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,159
actions shine

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
like where would you from all the

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,159
content you've done like what do you

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,720
think it really

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,720
shines within your developer workflow

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,760
yeah so i think for me personally the

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,919
thing that like

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,760
the the everyday task that everybody can

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,320
get behind is simply running

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,080
tests for your project so like it's so

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,440
easy to

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,120
automate your test like if you already

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,159
have a test suite going like you don't

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
have to have that

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,799
where somebody's going to have to

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,399
manually run it every time or do a

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,080
commit hook where that could be really

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,440
slow for the developer experience right

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,039
so the way you're setting this up is

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,640
like every time it gets pushed out to

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,480
gab it's gonna run those tests for you

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,240
i think that's like the the most core

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,159
example of like how this

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,000
immediately becomes helpful for people

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,039
but you know coupling like taking off

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,720
from there like they're

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,720
like i have that content reminder thing

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
where because i can run it in cron mode

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
i'm just

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,720
daily doing a task that i want so it's

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,519
really any kind of

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,919
code task that you want to perform um in

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,399
some kind of automated way like it's a

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,320
great tool for doing that yeah i i've

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,440
given a couple talks on this too as well

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,840
just recently in florida

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,760
florida jay asked to meet up um they

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,640
reached out to me and i spoke in florida

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,360
uh but they uh my examples always go

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
into

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,440
like github built a tool so you could

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,159
basically build some new features onto

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,679
github

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,720
uh so like updating changes or visual

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
testing and stuff like that

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,080
probably stuff that github is not going

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,760
to really address within your repository

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,760
your yeah within the framework of what

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,960
you're looking for but what i love about

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
it like

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,559
i like to automate stuff within the

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,600
repository so like if i know

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,039
that every single time a pr is opened or

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,799
every time i pee it rather every time a

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,000
pr is merged i know i'm going to need a

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,760
change log

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,600
being able to do something like i have a

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,279
web hook that follows whenever

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,679
something's merged in the main branch

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,960
and then generate that change log

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,120
automatically for me

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
because that's one thing you you don't

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,760
know when to uh

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,519
you don't keep up with sort of tweeting

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,600
out your own content i don't keep up

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,000
with keeping proper documentation so if

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,519
i have

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
opportunities to automate a piece of

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,720
that i will do that

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,159
and uh yeah definitely check out my

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,119
content i've got lots of examples on

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,560
that

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,320
like going back to the open source

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,839
example like when somebody does create a

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,639
pull request you have no idea sometimes

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,639
you have no idea

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,839
where that request is coming from or

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,440
what it's doing so

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,800
like having that github action set up on

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,320
your account like when somebody creates

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,119
a pull request it'll automatically run

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,200
those tests

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,639
like you can even run like linting and

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,280
prettier if you want to format those

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,280
changes

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
like that way it's whatever you have to

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,520
put your eyes on it you're not wasting

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,040
your time

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
testing if it works first you're just

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,760
making sure that you know the code

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,639
actually works

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,480
with those tests yeah and uh i do have

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,599
an example too that um

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,200
i'm gonna mention it to you because

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,399
you're doing a good job of making

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,960
content so if you want to

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,839
take this and run with it um i've got an

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
example where

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,839
i have uh so this is a workshop i i run

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,400
and i'll be running this at all things

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,880
sorry open source 101 at march 30th this

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,960
week

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,000
or sorry this month and uh i have an

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,640
example where

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,119
we have linting that that happens so we

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,560
sort of walk through this

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,920
yeah so here we go we got the node code

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
formatter it's a whole other github

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,520
action

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,040
that we're just gonna introduce right

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,160
now in the middle of the conversation uh

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,760
but what it does

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,200
is it links your code for you just as

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
you do it in prettier

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,400
uh but imagine someone that hasn't had

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,760
prettier setup or you're dealing with

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
contractors and their environments are

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
completely different

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,079
uh it actually takes that and then it

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,480
actually commits it back up

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,680
upstream to your your pr interesting so

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
you will get a change

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,880
from the formatted from the uh uh

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,119
the github action to let you know hey

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,280
they forward match your code for you so

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,960
like one thing that i i hate doing is

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,320
like sitting in the conversations and

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
trying to discuss linting

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480
when we should be discussing the actual

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,720
code itself like does the code work

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,160
is the code arc like is it architectured

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
in the way that we think it would

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,359
survive

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,760
code smells and all this other stuff but

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,960
yet we we get really focused on like

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,040
double quotes or single quotes in

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,079
javascript and i think it's valid like

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,599
you should make that decision but you

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,160
should make the decision once

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,520
uh so when you ask like where github

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,839
actions shine it shines in those

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,920
areas where you just do out of the box

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,440
things that you're not able to do

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,200
you know i can't convince everybody to

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
use vs code i can't convince everybody

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,320
to

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,520
use this thing um i guess you can if you

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,680
get a jetbrains license

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,960
everybody uses jetbrains and we're we're

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,560
off to the races but

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,400
yeah unfortunately not everybody wants

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,760
to code the same way i'm trying to

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,839
convince everybody to move to them and

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,599
it's just not working

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
yeah one way i like to put that is like

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
you're making the robots being the bad

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,119
guy right

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,119
so like you don't have to have the

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,400
tension in those conversations of a code

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,599
review where you have to

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,599
nitpick on those little things because

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,200
they are important like you said but

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,560
you know we don't need that in a code

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,320
review like we just need to look at the

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
major functionality so it helps so much

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,720
with that

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,400
yeah uh i wanted to take a step back and

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,320
look at the go back to the action we

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,560
originally started the conversation with

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,760
um because we didn't really get into we

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,800
mentioned

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,920
the toolkit um to be able to interact

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,160
with the actions but

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
uh i wonder if you're able to get

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,359
provide some insight into

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,720
well one i'll get to the proper repo um

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,800
but some insight to how this was

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,920
actually built sure

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,520
um so i think we can dig in right inside

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
do you want to start from the top so

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,359
yeah so i'll preface this with

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,359
the reason so if you want to go into the

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,119
docker file first

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,560
like this is the entry point in the

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,640
application and

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
you know i'm i'm not a docker guy i

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
don't know what i'm doing really but

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,599
the reason why i went with the docker

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,760
approach is because i was having a hard

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,400
time figuring out how to get the cypress

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,359
environment

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
up and running properly with all the

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,880
things that are needed

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,400
and like the caching mechanisms and you

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
know i talked to gleb over

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,640
at cypress and he mentioned maybe

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,280
snipers can

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,720
create a function that they export to

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,280
install cypress right in node which

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
would be great

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
um i haven't gone that far yet but this

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,760
provides me a way to spin up an

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
environment where i know that i can run

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,640
my action

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,480
code and it's gonna work so really what

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,040
this does it points to

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,160
the sh file which if you wanna go to the

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,160
sh file

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,440
yeah the entry point would oh is it in

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,440
source no no no

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
it was there it was yeah under the

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,720
cypress file

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,960
oh there we go yeah there we go so i

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,800
don't know why again

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,800
so like again this is a simple one like

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,680
we go into the workspace directory

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,280
um here i'm actually cloning the apple

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,800
tool size action

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
the reason i'm doing that is because

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,359
when we're working in somebody else's

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
workspace

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,040
and then we create the environment on

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,720
top of that i want to be able to pull on

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
that action code that i can use to run

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,680
it

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
now i maybe that's not the best way to

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,280
do it

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,640
i'm sure there's a better way to do it

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
but again this is how i figured out how

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,520
to do it

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,640
but then we install the dependencies for

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,520
that and then we

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,119
finally run the script and that's where

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,160
the meat of it's going to be if we want

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,240
to head over there

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,440
yeah and the the actual javascript file

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,320
itself yeah

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,960
yeah okay um so here this is where we

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,800
start to

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,800
pull out the action score and really i'm

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,760
only using the core for this one because

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,320
um since it's not like super complex

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
right now

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,839
what i'm really only using it for is

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,119
getting the input values so yeah we can

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,680
even see right at the bottom of the

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,280
screen there that i'm grabbing the api

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,960
key i'm grabbing the different

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,200
configuration variables so that people

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,040
can set their base url

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,720
but really just so that people can

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,000
configure it from the outside when they

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
all they want to do is drop it in their

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
workflow file

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,680
so a lot of the top probably most of the

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,440
script is actually just grabbing the

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,200
input values because then

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,280
as we get towards the bottom we're the

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,240
middle rather this is where i actually

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,200
do the

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
the site map generation so once we have

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,160
that

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,920
base url and we kind of determine what

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,599
kind of depth you want to do

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,760
we'll run that sitemap generator

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,000
function which will generate that file

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,839
or if you already have your file

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,960
provided i'm going to get that site map

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,240
so that we can use it

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,839
but either way at the end of the day

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,680
you're all we're ultimately going to

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,920
have

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
a pages to check variable which is going

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,320
to have

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
an array of all the pages that we want

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,040
to go through

00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,520
okay so as we get down to the bottom

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,000
here

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,839
um so this is where we actually run

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,400
cyprus and a scripted way so

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,319
they have this method run which allows

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,119
us to pass in the configuration that we

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,119
have

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,880
a lot of this is boilerplate and i

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,319
actually kind of got the idea of and

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,079
learning how to do this by

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,680
uh jason langsdorff actually put

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,079
together a visual testing plug-in for

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,000
netlify which was really cool um

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,920
but he did something similar here where

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,440
you pass in the configuration

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,200
um and then you kind of pass in these

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,599
environment variables because because

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,839
it's

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,520
it's uh you know we can't set our own

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,119
arguments to a function that

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,480
don't exist like we create these

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,880
environment variables so that we can

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
later

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,560
access them in the cypress environment

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,240
and that includes the things like

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,480
the app name which is really just like a

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,200
title the batch name it's another label

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,480
um and then we get some more apple tools

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,480
specific configurations

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,240
okay again i want to add more things to

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,359
it but that's at the core level

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,560
of what's going on with that yeah so i

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,560
think the uh

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,000
for the sake of getting this working and

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,000
having an example like this is

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,200
this is great and i'm sure i could see

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,440
where you could sort of

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,640
pull the levers and add the new

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,280
functions and

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,400
um expose more of the apple tools api

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,119
but yeah this is um

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,280
yeah for for me who has built actions

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,200
this is readable and writes javascript

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,640
i hope that folks uh if you do have

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,960
questions um

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,000
this is open sourced so i highly

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
recommend you

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
drop it a star give it a fork open an

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,000
issue appreciate that um

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,640
and then then we're able to uh you know

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,599
continue

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,040
letting open source win yeah and i i do

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,000
want to show you one more thing yeah

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,960
because i want to show the actual

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,960
cypress test

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,880
so if you go back up to the top level

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,160
and you go to the cypress directory

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,960
yep and then integration

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,760
and then the eyes so the cool thing

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
about this is

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,640
this is a really short and sweet file so

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,960
literally all we're doing is we're

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,040
taking those pages to check the array

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,880
and we're looping through it and we open

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,319
up eyes on each of those

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
urls and we pass we so we open the eyes

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,359
kind of like you imagine a camera lens

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,760
or your your eye

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,200
yeah we check the window grab the page

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,920
and then we close the eyes and that's

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,440
all you do

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
like if you even want to integrate this

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,240
into your own cypress workflow like

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,200
that's all you have to do to get up and

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,520
running so it's

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,960
it's really nice and short and sweet and

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,000
just passing in the configuration into

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,079
apple tools

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,400
uh that's awesome cause like i don't

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,520
have uh i know daryl just uh

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,599
dropped in the chat i really need to

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,599
learn cyprus i feel like gleb was

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,520
actually on the stream back in december

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,240
so i learned cyprus when glove came on

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,400
the stream

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,440
okay um actually added it to my bdugi

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,599
live site

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
and uh that's as far as i got i wrote

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,319
two tests and

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,720
basically have not gone back to writing

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,000
more tests um i just need more code just

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,880
in general on that site

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,680
um but definitely need more tests but i

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,560
like that

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,880
i can basically have not only cyprus but

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,440
also

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,720
i can also add apple tools to my my site

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,599
and get some of that visual testing as

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,200
well

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,640
yep yep there's not there's not a whole

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
lot that you have to add to get it and

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,680
again this is just the base level

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,280
like we talked about before about like

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,560
the different browsers that you can test

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,319
and of course i want to eventually be

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,640
able to have that configurable but

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,240
like this gets you so much with just

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,040
this little snippet

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,440
yeah and i wanted to grab the uh the

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,119
link

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,640
folks are asking about my workshop that

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,079
i've mentioned in passing

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,359
um i will drop it in i'll drop in the

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,520
chat so that way y'all

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,119
can catch it uh i won't actually find

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,280
the actual workshop but

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,240
essentially i i what i just showed colby

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,040
i walked through that

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,400
uh with the i think we had 200 people

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,440
last time we did it last year

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,560
um which was a lot of fun uh if y'all

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,800
if you just want to learn about open

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,560
source i highly recommend checking out

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
this event it's free for everybody

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,760
who wants to register uh and you get a

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
lot of sort of aspects

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,280
um i went to last year i went to an open

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,599
source design um

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,319
talk or workshop where i learned about

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,560
design

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,000
um in open source and how to sort of

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,720
establish that which is

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,920
yeah some good stuff but yeah i love the

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,680
theme of that page

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
yeah yeah they do a good job actually

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,119
todd uh

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,800
todd and the red hat folks have been in

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,359
partnership with this

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
and they do a good job of sort of you

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,720
know encouraging people to be open

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,839
source i love that there's an event that

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,520
is actually just focused on 100 that um

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,280
and it's all beginner focus too as well

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,839
to also point that out

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,839
that's awesome

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,880
excellent um yeah so yeah that's pretty

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
pretty like approachable uh the one

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,240
thing i don't want to ask about the the

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
dockerfall i'm not even ask

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,599
amazingly just mention uh because not

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,119
only people are aware of this uh because

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,319
i know you mentioned i'm not a big

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,200
docker person

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,800
i literally learned docker uh well i

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,440
knew docker before but i started using

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,839
docker

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,720
more heavily because of github actions

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,560
um

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,480
but i i started off this conversation

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,440
with a um

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,000
with my links to there we go build your

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,839
own

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,520
github action without a docker file um

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,040
not a lot of people aware of this but we

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
have this feature called composite run

00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,839
steps

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,040
uh and this actually allows you to put

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,280
all that sort of bash

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,720
scripting directly into action.yaml file

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,440
which we didn't actually take a look

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,839
at uh so i do encourage you call me if

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,680
you

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,880
if you want to back out of the sort of

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,160
docker rabbit hole

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,000
um you can definitely check that out um

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,839
but as i can actually even show an

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,440
example too as well but i did want to

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,880
take a look at your action.yaml because

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,240
not a lot of folks are aware

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,160
of that as well yeah no that's great and

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,520
nothing against docker is just like i

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,319
have a hard time understanding like

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,599
working between the different

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
environments so that's

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,880
you know that's why it's a little bit of

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,720
a bear for me yeah

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,160
yeah daryl mentioned a really good point

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,800
that not most debs are not great at

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,079
docker

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,480
except we just the goal is really

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,079
consistent environments uh and the thing

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,880
about that is that github

00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,800
what we're trying to do with this um uh

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,880
well i already lost my link

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,640
uh what we're trying to do with this is

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,920
uh give you that consistent environment

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,440
without you needing to

00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,839
leverage docker if you're not really

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,520
familiar with it so um that's awesome

00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,040
here the similar to how when you run

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,000
actions you can have a run step that

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,520
runs bash

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,520
it's like well you're installing that

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
cypress um

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,560
caching or i'm not forget what it was

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,240
already uh you can actually

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,480
do that sort of setup here interesting

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,240
yeah so definitely worth a look um and

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,599
then also my blog post i do go through

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
details on how to

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,800
migrate a docker action into a composite

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,480
run step

00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,839
action which is essentially delete the

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,440
docker file

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,839
add it to the action.yaml that's awesome

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,640
uh yeah and then the daryl uh follow up

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,760
on his question

00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,560
github actions ran using docker

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,760
actions 1.0 so that was the sort of the

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,760
one way to do it

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,079
uh that changed when actions 2.0 came

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,599
out which was i don't know if we really

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,800
and with in the world of github actions

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,160
i don't know if we actually spend a lot

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
of time really focusing on version

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,760
numbers

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,119
um because we don't um i went and

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,359
realized that there was like a

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,400
second version yeah in 2019 in the fall

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,319
of 2019 we

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,240
uh actually not the fall it was the

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,680
spring that's when we added ci

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,240
as part of the the functionality of the

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,839
action so actions did not ship with ci

00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,560
originally in 2018 uh so when 2019 when

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,839
2019 versions of actions came out uh we

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,680
made it possible that you didn't have to

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,440
use a docker file as well when running

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,680
actions awesome

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,000
yeah and again they both work just as

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,680
well the one caveat is like depending on

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,160
how much work you're doing in docker and

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,720
setup

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,480
it could take longer you can actually

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,280
use a lot of built-in caching and stuff

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,680
like that with

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,440
github's uh runners by going the

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,880
composite run steps so

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,119
usually your discretion you'll

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,720
definitely pull the levers play with it

00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,839
and see if it works for you

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,200
yeah and when i was talking to glub

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,040
about that like he made a good point

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,480
like i and i didn't realize how much

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,640
that github actually

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,800
ships with the environment like i know

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,079
the aws cli is there by default

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,000
and like he was mentioning that there's

00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,800
browsers by default so like that's a lot

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,359
of

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,559
like basic things that people can use

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,880
when they're working with their sites

00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,760
it's

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,800
awesome yeah the the feature and i

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,079
didn't mention i was gonna say like i

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,480
mentioned before but i didn't mention

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,000
this

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,520
but every time i talk about actions i

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,119
mention this the the whole

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,480
point of actions is so that github can

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,200
give you some tools and then get out of

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,280
the way

00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,800
um so with the action hosted action

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,880
runner environment we're giving

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,160
we're giving the minutes we're giving

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,280
the environment so that way you can take

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,040
it and run with it

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,800
uh and if it doesn't work for you you

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,480
can always do a self-hosted version

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,640
uh you can pull out the docker you could

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,800
do whatever you would like to do to

00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,319
make it work for you so i love having

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,119
questions with open source maintainers

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,640
and

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,079
learning their issues and their problems

00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
and seeing if i have an answer for it if

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,319
i don't

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,680
i love talking to the pm team and saying

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,079
hey

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,920
this open source project could use xyz

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,240
would you like to put xyz into the

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,240
runner

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,839
yeah and i think it's great because like

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,119
because you can run node scripts or you

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,960
know whatever scripts you want like

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,480
there's so many possibilities of what

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,200
you can do yeah yeah

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,640
yeah good times and uh folks it seems

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,599
like we're our chat's getting live here

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,720
uh livelier

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,640
now so if you have questions about

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,520
github actions apple tools

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,880
if you have questions about colby and uh

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,680
how he's making that purple white in the

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,960
background

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,720
um definitely chat's open for questions

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,000
uh this is open source friday so if you

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,240
just joined us

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
github we host open source maintainers

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,000
action creators contributors

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,839
uh to talk about their projects and give

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,400
them a place to you know get those shiny

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,280
stars

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,480
uh just kidding stars are great uh but

00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,680
on that note actually

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,680
uh did you have anything else you want

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,280
to add about the action uh i did have a

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,680
another off

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,520
off the cuff uh random question but i

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,400
didn't want to

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,760
interject it and get you off the rails

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,880
no i don't think i think in particular

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,800
you know i think uh

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,880
i'm i'm excited to kind of pour more

00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,079
time into building out features with it

00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
like i was talking about the static

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,559
directory thing

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,720
um so it's just you know be able to

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,720
figure out ways because like ultimately

00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,559
github doesn't have the context of the

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,359
application beyond what you give it

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,920
right so

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,680
if i need to figure out ways to do that

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,319
config in a configurable way for people

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,240
so

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,920
um you know figuring that as i go along

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,599
but it's it's a cool challenge and

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,200
i'm having a lot of fun with it yeah and

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,319
i would encourage anybody who also is

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,160
doing um

00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,559
a lot of this action work building stuff

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,000
for your company like colby's doing

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
i do encourage you to check out the

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
github support community as well

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,359
um it might not just be as clear but if

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,359
you do want to talk about github actions

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,359
just go into the ecosystem tab

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,480
and then we have lots of questions that

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,000
are unanswered we have a lot of

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,200
questions that are answered

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,559
so if you're just sort of like trying to

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,079
figure out hey brian mentioned this

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,400
thing i forgot what it was called

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,920
i'm using docker but i don't want to ask

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,920
those questions here

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,680
our support team our pm team our

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,160
engineering teams are all in here

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,440
answering questions for you so um i do

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,800
encourage you to just definitely check

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,240
that out

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,559
so moving on i did want to ask you about

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,760
one thing that honestly i i used to ask

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,800
this to all the people who came on the

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,839
open source friday

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,440
uh which is github stars um

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,960
a lot of folks like they they have

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,559
questions about get upstars and

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,240
i'm doing a whole just i'm building a

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,800
whole nother project um outside of

00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,839
github

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,280
where it encourages you to

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,599
contribute to open source it's called

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,040
opensoft and uh it has

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,280
a new feature i've been building for the

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,960
past couple weeks on stream where

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,400
based on your interactions with github

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,559
it will

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,400
basically suggest contributions that you

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,119
can make that's that's the highlight

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
that's really cool

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,880
um i haven't got that far yet so it's

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,599
really cool but it's right now it's just

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,599
an idea

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,640
uh in a database i just have i have a

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,319
database of some

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,839
projects that i'm going to be doing some

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:23,280
weird checking with

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,800
um and uh

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,839
the question uh i don't know how to

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,480
academ uh get a package replacement npm

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,040
registry

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,400
the answer is no npm registry exists get

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,000
a package that exists because

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,319
there are other use cases that are

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,680
needed uh for packages especially in the

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,960
enterprise world

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,119
if you want to host packages for your

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,920
organization uh it's a little different

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,079
approach so

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,200
think outside javascript for pack github

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,359
packages

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,240
um man it's like i'm doing my job just

00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,280
24 7

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,559
all the time um so i actually wanted to

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,200
uh a lot of people don't know this you

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:59,280
can actually go into github stars

00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,559
and i'm going to put your name which i

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,559
think i spelled it

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,960
correctly and i can see the last stuff

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,040
that you uh you have starred so

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,480
which is uh kind of closes out the

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,839
conversation like to

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,920
ask you questions about the stuff that

00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,160
you've been starring on github

00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,319
that's fun yeah so anything anything

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,599
here sort of jumps out at you

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:23,520
so that top one was interesting to me um

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:25,920
the uh so i i really like to use

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,920
um man i'm trying to can you scroll down

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,359
a little bit so i can see what the

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,960
um this is amazing

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,119
who thinks of this right right right um

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,079
uh but it was yeah so i'm a big fan of

00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,480
scss

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,480
and okay part of the issue that this

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,599
person was trying to solve was that

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,000
so if you're using something like

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,520
typescript or i think even like you know

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,760
css and js like

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,920
you don't get the same uh type

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,800
generation tools and stuff like you get

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,079
uh when you use scss so this person came

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,160
up with a solution where

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,720
you kind of write inside of your scss

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,400
like js doc where you define those props

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,319
and what it can do to

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,359
change the styles and you get this auto

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,480
generation i thought it was a really

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,920
cool idea

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,160
because i haven't seen something like

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,440
that yet and you know as an scss fan

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,960
something like that is valuable but yeah

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,839
i just thought that was neat

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,200
excellent uh honestly i'm stuck on this

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,599
is that supposed to be freddie mercury

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,079
i'm like

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,119
trying to i think so that's that's how i

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,960
take it yet

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,319
this is excellent uh i'm gonna give this

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,079
a star because

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,760
not that i need this but i just think

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,319
the the effort that they put into their

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,559
um

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:34,400
their readme is worth the star so

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,520
everybody uh if you're interested in

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,280
learning more about

00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,200
scss or sas um i love sas

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,640
yeah i used to use it a lot back in when

00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,400
i first started in the web development

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,240
program that program when i started

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,680
using web development like seriously and

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,480
actually building projects that people

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,119
used

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,280
um sas was huge and i used it pretty

00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,400
much in everywhere i touch

00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,760
and i've sort of fallen off the train

00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,559
mainly because i start a lot of new

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,720
projects

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,319
and it's just it's more work to try to

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,640
get everything set up the way i want it

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,960
to

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,760
and like sas isn't as included in a lot

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,839
more of these uh

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,520
frameworks and boiler points so i've

00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,559
sort of followed off the sash train

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,880
um i use post css at this point now

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,559
okay yeah i i created like my own so i

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,240
use an xjs a lot so i created like my

00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,319
own starter where i have it already

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,240
all bootstrapped and stuff but um yeah

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,839
like i haven't ever hit the

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,440
like i know there's definitely a lot of

00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,319
benefits with something like css and js

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,000
but i don't think i've ever hit the

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,280
limitations of sas because

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,280
like a lot of times i'm working with a

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,160
small team or something where it doesn't

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,079
really hit those uh um you know

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,160
limitations as much

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,599
yeah excellent and it looks like you're

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,000
uh just looking at your other stuff

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,040
oh final space api that scene oh yeah

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,319
let's stick into that one

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,880
have you heard have you heard of final

00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:50,160
space i have not heard of final space

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,280
it's it's my favorite cartoon uh olan

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
rogers

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,520
it's an amazing so it's like a it's like

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,559
an epic space journey and i love it so

00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,200
much but um

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,240
this uh this person put together uh an

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,359
api for it

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,200
you know i'm sure you've seen like the

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,680
pokey api yeah like those kind of things

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,440
but yeah the game of thrones yeah

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,920
yeah so there was never a final space

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,280
api and um

00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,040
now we have one yeah

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,559
honestly is this like uh is this on

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,680
cartridge network where is it um

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,119
where is this um so it's on tbs but now

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,599
i think they put the the first two

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:27,119
seasons up on hbo max

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,480
um so it's yeah and i think

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,960
other countries have it on netflix

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,520
um but yeah it's a tbs show but it's

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,440
it's so

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,040
like if you're into like that kind of

00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,200
like animated

00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,040
uh shows like it's space adventure it's

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,200
so great is it like off the wall like

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,960
adventure time

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,480
it's not that off the wall but it's

00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,000
definitely like goofy and fun

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,280
but it's like it also has like the

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,720
serious note because it's like a real

00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,280
space journey that it's kind of going

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,520
through for

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,880
the seasons it's okay i definitely think

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,160
if that sounds at all interesting i

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,400
definitely think you should check it out

00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,240
you know i'm always worth the uh because

00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,119
i love watching like stuff i can turn my

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,319
brain off

00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,040
uh while i'm uh writing code uh so like

00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,559
i

00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,000
i watched a couple of the adventure time

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,040
movies i just watched adventure time

00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,599
back in college

00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,240
um in like real like what was it the

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,559
real show

00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,319
um anyway i watched pretty much a lot of

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,480
those adult swims type stuff

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,079
and that's like what i put on like if

00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,839
i'm doing late night coding and i just

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,640
need to like turn off my brain but also

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,720
stay awake

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,400
