Title: The toolkit for building cross-platform text editors with remirror - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2021-03-22
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	remirror was started as a personal challenge. Would it be possible to build an editor that combined great performance with ease of use? It was also important to give users of all frameworks, the ability to build an editor by picking and choosing their desired building blocks.

In order to meet these goals, ProseMirror was picked as the best choice for the core editor layer. The second decision was to base the structure of the editor on blocks of functionality called Extensions. Each extension would be designed to fulfill a specific purpose in the editor. Due to this structure, users would be able to craft a fully custom implementation.

Join @bdougieYO and @ifiokjr in learning the latest in text editor magic with ProseMirror and React.

other streams and i think we need to

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,120
have like some sort of bumper intro

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,120

i just have not had the time to put it

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,320
in but this is open source friday is the

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,160
time for us to talk to open source

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
maintainers about their project

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,760
i i have the chat open so definitely let

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
me know if they're volumes or levels

they're good

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,920
or if they're not good i can adjust if

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
you have questions about the project

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,640

and let's all have a great time but

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,920
speaking of great time

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,079
uh i'm gonna have a great time with our

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
guests uh which is iffy iffy

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
why don't you introduce yourself if

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
folks aren't familiar with you and what

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,879
you do and what you maintain

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
hey everyone so my name is italy and i

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,160
am an open source developer i'm a

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
developer and happens to do some open

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
source work

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
and um and the project i'm here to

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
discuss the project i've been working on

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,199
maybe for for the last year

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
is called remember so it's kind of like

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,720
a really

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,479
you know a really ambitious text editor

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
built on top of pros mirror

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,240
for react and actually supports multiple

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,360
frameworks although right now

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,119
react is the focus so um but we've got

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,400
like react native in the works

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,400
so you can you can deploy the same

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
editor to react as you do to

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
to your um to your mobile apps as well

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
so yes exciting times

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
awesome so the last time we spoke i

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
couldn't show you a demo and the reason

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
i couldn't show you the demos it was

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,479
still in

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,159
just just being work on a lot of a lot

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,119
of things and and the development

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,119
approach i've taken

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,960
maybe isn't probably using the best but

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,720
this is my first open source project

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,079
so a lot of it was just just discovering

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,880
okay what what works for me

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
how do i yeah so just uh this is an

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
intro like i will

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
if you're interested in contributing to

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
projects on github this will actually be

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
great for you

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
um because uh i'm gonna go through some

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,479
of the tips on how to contribute to

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
re-mirror

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
some of the maybe uh issues you you can

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
you can pick up on i'm just responding

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
to

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,880
one of her things so um but

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,399
but yeah remira is a project for for

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
building text editors so say for example

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,959
you wanted to build your own google docs

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,599
or you wanted to build maybe something

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,760
simpler

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
a chat app that has mentions or or a

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
markdown text editor or an editor that

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
just exports that

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
gives people a visual representation of

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
what you're typing but allows them to

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
export it to markdown

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
the remira is just like a toolkit for

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,800
you and if you're using react

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,400
you're going to love it if you're not

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,400
using react you may not love it as

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
much but we all love it soon so that

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
that's in the works we uh

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
it's it's like it's already

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,400
cross-platform there is no reason why

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
react

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
is the only one you can use the only

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,120
thing is i've focused mainly on reactor

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
because that's my forte

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
it's better to start where you what you

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,560
know and then like roll out afterwards

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,680
um so so yeah so i i guess i guess i

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
could jump into just

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
showing showing you some of the some of

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
the code and this is like really basic

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
stuff so

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
so what we want to do now we want to add

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,599
some ui to to the to the editor

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
and again so uh this um we mirror react

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,239
comes to the rescue

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,080
so in remote react um we're gonna add

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
so first we're gonna add some extensions

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,959
to make this possible

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,879
i'm just like finding the extensions i

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,480
need so i'm just

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,480
looking at what extensions i need for

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
this

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
okay so um so here i would say let's

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,239
just keep it really simple so let's say

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
on uh online italic whatever things

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,560
should we add

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
any other extensions you would be

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
interested in seeing uh let's say

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
heading a strike through something

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,840
that's um

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,879
yeah an extension yeah strikethrough

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
strike extension

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,799
what else is there um there's

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
bi-directional extensions you can

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,360
actually like

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,879
if you if you need to support languages

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
you can say okay by direction

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,439
extension will automatically look at the

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
language you're using and set the

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
direction of the editor

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,319
to what it needs to be whatever

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,720
extensions that are

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,159
um there's an annotation extension which

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,159
is used really like one of my

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,280
contributors added this that's so good

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,879
actually one of the sponsors out of

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
there it's such a good extension it's

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,159
really really like advanced so i can

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,360
show that to you i have time later

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,680
there's an emoji extension um

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
which actually in fact let me put the

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,000
emoji extension in so

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
the emoji extension is like one of the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,479
things that were the aha moment for me

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
uh when you showed how easy it was to to

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
create that functionality because

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,680
that feels like a a feature that i would

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
spend way too many weeks trying to build

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
myself

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,080
uh but when he showed that off last time

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,680
that was what sort of got me

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,840
hooked yeah yeah yeah so

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
hopefully we get time to look at that so

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
uh so new heading extension

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,360
so let's just uh start with the basics

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
and what we want to do we want to add

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
like a

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,000
top top menu to this editor so what i'm

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,520
going to do

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,520
here is

00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,240
i'm going to um

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
yeah so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna say

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
okay so i'm gonna

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
so this is gonna be a bit difficult

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,320
because i'm not doing this with um

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
with uh typescript so it may look like

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
i'm just doing a bit of magic so let's

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
say um

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,199
but it's not magic it's just it's just

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,440
good

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
hopefully good code yeah yeah so let's

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
stretch you

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,120
yeah so also let's add a history

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,400
extension

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
so history adds support for undoing

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
attention some of the extension is

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,120
already included by default in call

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:38,639
um so let's add some cons toolbar

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,440
and then equals so we're going to create

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,960
an array of like

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
what we want i'm just going to copy and

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
paste it in just because um

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,639
if you're using typescript this kind of

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
is just like really easily done for you

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
and maybe i'll show it to you in touch

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
with after

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,039
but um so it's like just configuration

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,919
you just configure

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,319
what you want um and they should just

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
work

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
so

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
it's a component item so from from the

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,960
mirror

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,360
react we can start adding like

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,080
so so okay so what so what we've done

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
here let me just

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,600
tell you what we've done here we've um

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
we have like each each toolbar has like

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
a type

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
so uh and let me let you let me just add

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
it before

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,360
before i show you so each like we've

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
just configured and said okay i want to

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
add

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
a history um so a history uh

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
uh undo and redo so like the label here

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,479
saying okay this

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,759
toolbar is a grouping and it's gonna be

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,880
we're gonna call it history so like when

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
you hover over it you should see you

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
should see the history

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
um pop up and it's going to have two

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
commands undo and redo

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,120
and the great thing about this is

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
because the

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,520
internationalization is built in into

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
remy so what what this will do is that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
it looks at the command each command can

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
define each extension can define the

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
commands it makes available

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,759
and part of defining that it can it can

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
define the default icon

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,960
that uses that's used and it can also

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
define the default label you can always

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
override this but if you want to use the

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,039
defaults you can just leave it

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,120
like this so this will just

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,240
automatically fill out uh this

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,680
information for you

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,280
um and um let me get rid of this

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
tool because copy and paste actually

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
isn't isn't uh isn't

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,240
fun so so what we're going to do we're

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
going to add that to our

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
toolbar extension uh so let me just

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,319
quickly

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,240
get that going um

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,759
so so okay so what what

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
we're gonna do is gonna be importing the

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
toolbar extension a toolbar component

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,560
sorry from remote react

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,720
so toolbar which is just this

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,000
toolbar yeah and we're going to use it

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,759
in

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
so within again within this the context

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
you can get with this line we're in the

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,240
context because

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
we need access to like we want our bold

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,879
to have access to all the commands and

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
stuff so within the context can you say

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,440
toolbar

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,440
um and uh say items

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,840
equals going to start breaking

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
toolbar and uh

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
yeah i think that's okay that's that's

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,400
it item is equal to bar

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,400
and that should

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,879
give us something okay for some reason

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,319
it's good oh yes yes yes

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,840
so okay it's rendering below and the

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,440
reason it's rendering below is because

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
i've said auto render

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,960
okay so yeah so you can see the toolbar

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,360
is here so if i start adding a text and

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
i say

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
undo it undoes yeah so there's two

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,319
issues here

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,919
real quick um just to reiterate your

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
error message was blocking everything

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
that was showing so as you were adding

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
it folks

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
probably weren't getting the correlation

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,640
what was happening but as you're adding

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
these components

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,479
they they were actually showing up here

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,320
yes

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,680
yes so i just yeah i added these

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
components and they're showing up

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
they're showing up here

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,200
so for example uh i can um so just just

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
a number of things so you can see as i

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
hover

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
uh like i can see like the automatic

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
labels that are given

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,959
again these are all fully um uh

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
so you can have full

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
internationalization so bold can be

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,600
swapped out for whatever language i have

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
set up crowding but once i set up

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
crowding if you set the language of the

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,440
editor to

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,040
french it will come up will show up in

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
french so this is all kind of built in

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,000
by default with

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
room mirror um so let me get rid of

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
separation because so for example just

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,000
by changing that

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,560
i got rid of this little separator at

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,160
the end um

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
and so yeah so with just the built-in

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,320
stock you get a lot of functionality

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,200
the icons are using remix icon so remix

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,120
icon

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,120
this really cool uh library and i've

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
kind of like taken it

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
i've given them full attribution so

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,760
every time if you

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
but like there's just a lot of great

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,120
icons so uh please start the repo

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
check it out it's a great library but uh

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,680
and it's helped me a lot

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
um so so just a few things so first um i

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,240
can undo

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,600
i can make stuff bold but notice one

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
thing so when i press bold

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
uh and then i start typing i've lost

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
focus so uh

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
one of one of the things that the

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
toolbar maybe this should be a default

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,600
please your suggestions are

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,880
are us are welcome

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,959
so one of the one of the props is

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
refocus editor it's a boolean so

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,079
focus editor that means that by default

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,600
when i press the command

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,920
it will automatically refocus the editor

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,079
so now if i if i make this unbold

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,360
and type it it knows to go back to the

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,480
editor as soon as it's done whatever

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
it's doing just it's just

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,839
the standards you expect the second

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
issue we have is that this is below and

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,480
i actually want it

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
to be above above the editor again this

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
is all style.css i'm not going to go

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,200
into styling

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
you can like literally override the css

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,399
what this component is doing is giving

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
the default styles but you don't have to

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
include it you can literally leave this

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
out

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,600
and provide your own styles or you can

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
put it in and override your styles

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,640
as you see fit so um this this style

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,720
component

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
i'm i'm using a motion in this in this

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
in this demo so there's

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,160
there's a version for it's a version of

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
promotion there's also

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
a style components version if you want

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
to see star components and there's also

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
a dom version if you just want to use a

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
pure dom

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,600
so since i'm using emotion and if you

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,519
want to use just pure css you would say

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,120
import um import

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,519
so so you import from here at re mirror

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,760
styles and then it's forward slash

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
four slash all css so it just imports

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
all the styles

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
so that's another way of doing it if

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,000
your build system supports it so um

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,519
there's like this i try to be flexible

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,720
as possible in terms of

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,800
before we we relied fully on emotion uh

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,399
but now emotion is just an option you

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
can use emotion if you use it or not

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
but so yeah the other issue is that this

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
is now rendering below uh so we're just

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,040
going to make it remember above

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
and the way we do that is also render so

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
by default when you auto render

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,079
it it does it but let's get rid of auto

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
render let's show you like uh

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,720
let's quickly put in editor

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,000
component so we have an editor component

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,920
which is kind of what is auto rendered

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
when you want to render but by importing

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,200
it

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,320
you can actually you can actually decide

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
where it goes so we're going to say

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
actually i want the auto render to

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
offer the toolbar so i want the edits to

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
component to come in after the toolbar

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
so um just wanted to sort of round up

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
the the conversation because we only

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
have

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,079
like 15 minutes left um we saw how to

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
sort of integrate

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,399
and um and touch the code sandbox

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,399
i don't know if that is that if that

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,200
link is available for folks to also

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,240
jump into or like how can they how can

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
they get their hands

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
uh onto a demo so if you at the moment

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
if you go to

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
the pull requests tab so one of the

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,200
things i've introduced and this is going

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,519
to be for contributors

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,519
and for sponsors so one of us so the

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,000
first pull request the top one

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,600
oh wait no no not that one interesting

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
one so this is again one of the

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
so one of one of the new new joiners uh

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
who's helping

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,600
is uh he's creating like faqs and really

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
doing some good work so if you've got

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,279
your baseball beta release

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
i realized mike mike so the bottom one

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,079
my uh

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
my one automatically puts it at the top

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,320
so the most recent is at the top

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
um okay so if you if you scroll all the

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
way to the bottom so

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,200
right down um

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
so yeah so whenever whenever um like a

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
releases happens on the pr

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
you have a sandbox you can say open in

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,200
sandbox for javascript or open encode

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
sandbox typescript

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
so that's the way you can get like the

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
latest releases energy that will be

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,240
added to the readme

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,880
right now this is purely on on pr

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
because uh so so one thing i found in

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,680
some projects um

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
when you uh when you

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,839
um yeah so

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,920
whenever a project is is released

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
uh or like when a project sometimes like

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
you you had there's a change or a fix

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
that's been done in

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
a branch um sometimes maybe the

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
contributors are a bit slow to merge it

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
in or maybe there's other

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,120
things that that they need to sort out

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
before they can merge it into the code

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,200
base

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,120
but one of the things i want to offer or

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,800
i am offering is that

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
if you see code that you want in a

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,760
branch you literally can just say

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,760
i want this to be published and as soon

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,639
as you publish it it's available for you

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,560
on npm and you can just um use it so if

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,920
you look at the versions

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
so this is taking a long time because

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,560
you're you're literally the first person

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,160
to click this link this is like

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,440
literally released like 10 minutes ago

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
so he's obviously doing it for the first

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
time um but but yeah

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,120
if you go if you go above if you scroll

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
up one keeps going up and click the

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,160
so keep going up until you see the next

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
the next gif here so if you open in

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
sandbox so

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
go back down open code sandbox this one

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,040
should open quicker because

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
i've opened it before i think uh code

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,000
sandbox cache is

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,120
actually caching yeah this one is like

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,320
instant almost

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,279
um so yeah there's like so this is like

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,320
an older version

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,920
but it kind of shows you yeah that

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,680
that is really interesting uh and i'm

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,040
that's really awesome i have so many

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
more questions about how you're making

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,680
this work

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
um because i see you're using github

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,519
actions so

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
can we take a quick detour and uh yeah

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,880
sure check out your actions

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
yeah because i think this is a really

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
good use case for actions

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,320
okay so uh so in workflows i've got this

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,199
um

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,760
published pr so if you go to just before

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,519
yeah publish

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,839
pull requests so and i have to give

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,680
thanks to one of my contributions akkavu

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,279
has actually helped make this better so

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,720
before there were some potential bugs

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,480
and he added he added like i didn't know

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
you could do inline js so he added this

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
inline js which

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
um takes the ref and allowed yeah he

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
made it better let's just say

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
yeah yeah one of my favorite things to

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
talk about to be quite honest

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,720
i had no idea i was like mind blown

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,880
it's really cool um so so what what what

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,160
is happening so this is a

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,079
um so basically whenever a comment is

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
is posted so if you type a forward slash

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,360
publish if you scroll up

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
just before the script so whatever yeah

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,240
so it looks for the common body

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,199
in a pull request or whenever publish is

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
typed and you're either an author

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,240
a contributor and eventually i'll add a

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,759
sponsor as well right now

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
whenever someone becomes a sponsor and

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
wants to do this i just add them as a

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,680
contributor but if

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,320
uh like whenever you're one of those

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,079
things um it can process it like it will

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,600
say okay this is time to do a release

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,360
so um if you scroll down

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
the whole like the release is using an

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
internal action

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
so like i do the installation i build a

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,440
project so this is

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,800
normal stuff that's just installing and

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
auditing the dependencies just to make

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,000
sure you're not like adding any weird

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,199
stuff

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,800
to the build and then um uh

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,800
yeah so then the next one is to mutate

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,759
the package.json file so so what

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,839
what i'm basically doing is wait what is

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,199
it

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
if you scroll up scroll up if you i

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,480
think i've missed where oh no no scroll

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,079
scroll down yeah it is it is there

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,160
it is there it is so the action is um pm

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,079
that installs it and what yeah oh this

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,199
is the one so this one uses an internal

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,040
um an internal uh script

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,880
which is in forward slash support

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,199
forward slash actions forward slash pr

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
so

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,240
you go to that file

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,120
uh it's in support support yeah

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,199
and then then actions and then pr

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,560
so if you go to source don't go to pr

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
this is like it's uh

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,839
you go to source and then you go to pr

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
here

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,959
so it builds to that pr for a little bit

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
so

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,079
okay so this is a just a just a quick

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
script

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,519
to exactly just power the sort of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,839
printing to

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,799
um exactly that it takes a pr number

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,480
does it release to npm for for for you

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,559
but i i think it's so powerful because i

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,559
i've especially with mono response it's

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,600
so like there's a fix that you just need

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,559
you just need this one fix

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,240
and it's like it's just they're sitting

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,919
there in some branch someone's done and

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
you have nowhere to get into it so

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
so what what this will allow us for like

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
i'm going to completely stop using

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
pre-releases

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,959
this is how i'm going to do pre-releases

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
pre-releases from now will be a

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
long-lived branch

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,760
uh maybe has the latest code and once

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
it's ready to be merged it gets merged

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,280
back in

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,960
oh can i also say i i know you work for

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
github github actions it's just it's

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
beautiful

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,200
it's like i i was saying before recall

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,480
that i really believe github is

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,640
cornering the market

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,760
in terms of just producing great

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
developer tooling

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,840
like the code spaces have been my laptop

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
sometimes starts lifting off i just

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,120
found that if i use code spaces i can

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
code without having

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
i'm looking forward to getting a more

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,320
powerful laptop but i can code without

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,840
having to worry about you know the fans

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
blowing up because it's kind of being

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,760
done in the cloud it's just there's so

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,799
many tools that github is introducing

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
that just really work well for

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,120
developers and

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,640
yeah i'm i'm happy to i just enjoy using

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,600
it like i just enjoy

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,320
uh your ecosystem yeah and i would say

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,080
everybody

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,320
uh click the sponsor link so that way if

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,520
you can get a new laptop

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,919
so that way he doesn't have to worry

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,360
about it taking off on them as well

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,039
oh that's you've just spotted something

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,520
so oh one one thing

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,200
i'm also making um a change to so um

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,720
oh okay so i guess some users aren't

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
enrolled so i

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,840
like i i should have checked before i

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
did that so um

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
one thing i've done so anyone who's

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,799
contributed to remember in the last six

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,880
months i add them to the sponsors

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,919
the list because i just feel like it's

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
not just it's not just

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,880
me who's working on this so if you want

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,240
to work on a project and want to have

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
the opportunity to you know put it on

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
your profile and be sponsored for yeah

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,840
literally come on just just just kind of

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
like for me the most important part

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,000
remember isn't isn't me and my code is

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,280
actually

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
like the community that's being built

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
around it i've been so impressed with

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,880
some of the contributions

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
i've been so impressed uh benji has just

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
been like like just

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
amazing and like so yeah he's there like

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
if you

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,480
if you want to sponsor and sponsor him

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,240
will hawker is maybe a

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
bit less well known in the community but

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,799
he's been doing some really good work

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,320
he's actually recently added

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,440
a list uh checkbox extension

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,440
so i'm going to check over that next

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
week and hopefully manage that uh

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,000
eventually

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
um and there's there's also another a

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
few others that i put in but

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
i don't think they have sponsorship

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,600
profiles yet so that's why they're not

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
showing up they might have to sign up

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,799
for it um yeah

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,919
to get access which is so are you doing

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,280
that manually so when you get a

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,720
contributor are you then adding them to

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,200
the sponsors list

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,080
at the moment i was gonna also do it

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,760
again

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,880
sometimes you automate too much this

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
right now there's not many but like i

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
was gonna do it so it will look to see

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
um anyone who's contributed in the last

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
six months just add them to that list

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
and and so like that's that's kind of

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,039
what what i wanna

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
have going yeah and that's uh super

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,640
honorable for you to do that too as well

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,320
and it's also a great way to sort of

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,000
dig up the people who are helping to

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,799
keep the project moving forward

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
and like supporting it as well so like

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
um

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,919
awesome idea uh i'm pretty sure i'm

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,200
gonna actually talk to github about this

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,240
uh the folks who are managing the

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,679
sponsors program

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,280
uh because that's a great feature that

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,120
should be built into the platform and it

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,080
shouldn't be a manual thing

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,280
awesome i think um can i go for it yeah

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,960
