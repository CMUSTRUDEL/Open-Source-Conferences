Title: The toolkit for building cross-platform text editors with remirror - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2021-03-22
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	remirror was started as a personal challenge. Would it be possible to build an editor that combined great performance with ease of use? It was also important to give users of all frameworks, the ability to build an editor by picking and choosing their desired building blocks.

In order to meet these goals, ProseMirror was picked as the best choice for the core editor layer. The second decision was to base the structure of the editor on blocks of functionality called Extensions. Each extension would be designed to fulfill a specific purpose in the editor. Due to this structure, users would be able to craft a fully custom implementation.

Join @bdougieYO and @ifiokjr in learning the latest in text editor magic with ProseMirror and React.
