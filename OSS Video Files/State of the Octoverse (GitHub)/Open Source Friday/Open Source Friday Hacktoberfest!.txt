00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
today

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,790
we're going to be talking about october

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,959
1st

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,360
[Music]

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
so this year it is the seven year

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
anniversary

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
of hacktober first so oktoberfest was

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,519
started

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
seven years ago which is really insane

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
when you think about it

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
and it was started by mainly by

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
digitalocean

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
digital ocean intel deaf community we

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
obviously have a lot of different

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,319
partners involved in hacktoberfest

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
but hacktoberfest was started as a

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
month-long celebration to encourage

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,080
people

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,959
to get involved in open source so if you

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,400
are new here

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,879
not too sure what open source is open

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,519
source

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
is i'm going to turn my body off just a

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
little bit

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,840
so open source is a

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
community first and foremost but it was

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,000
also it refers to software so when we

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
talk

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
about like an open source software we

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
talk about

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
software that is free to use and free to

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,319
contribute to

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,840
so we talk about the open source

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,879
community we talk about a community of

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
developers

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
who are working together writing code

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
together

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
building projects together and learning

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
together as well which is what i really

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
really like about the open source

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,120
community

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
is this community of just learning

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
together and being amazing

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
and so seven years ago i hacked over you

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
know a bunch of people who started

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,959
hacktube

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,799
first thought that this would be a

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
really really good way to encourage

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
people to get involved in open source

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,439
because a lot of people use open source

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,439
software projects

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
but don't necessarily contribute to i

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
don't even know how to contribute to it

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
and so this was started as a way to get

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
people involved

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
so in the open source community there's

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,479
kind of like a

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
an ethos almost like an unspoken rule if

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,160
you will

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,479
that if you use open source software you

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,400
contribute back to open source

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
now there's lots of different ways to

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,040
contribute now i'm going to talk about a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
lot of those ways

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,880
obviously one of the main ways to

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,880
contribute back is by writing code or

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
bug fixes writing features things like

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
that

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,360
there's a whole bunch of different ways

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
to contribute now there's ways to

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,320
contribute by

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,440
requesting features and you can

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,919
contribute by

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,800
helping out with documentation can help

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,600
by

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
working on you know the management side

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
of it

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
graphics design there's a whole bunch of

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
stuff so we're going to go

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,759

about

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,639
october 1st how it was started seven

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,759
years ago and a little bit about our

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
open source

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
and what the concept of open source is

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
enjoy to live what's up good to see you

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,479
too

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
oh so it dies the same way listen so

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,800
github is listed as a followed channel

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,039
we're not showing us online

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,080
ah random is available for you to press

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,039
like

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,039
um

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
interesting that is super interesting do

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
you reckon it's because it might be a

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
different github channel there are a

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
couple of random channels

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,000
so make sure you're following obviously

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,919
this one

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,199
yeah you had no idea how to have a

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,440
twitch we've had it for

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,160
quite some time we haven't done a lot on

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,880
it until very recently we've been doing

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,600
lots of stuff on the twitch channel so

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,680
we run these open source friday sessions

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,759
yes it usually runs on a friday but

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
today we're ready on tuesday

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
because we had to reschedule from last

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,800
friday we've got another one happening

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
this friday so we kind of slotted it in

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,120
between

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
but basically we do a whole bunch of

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
stuff in our twitch channel now we do

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,440
open source friday streams like this

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,280
where we usually get a maintainer of a

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,319
big open source project on and we chat

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919

so every year we publish the state of

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,640
the octopus which publishes the top

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,839
open source projects on github uh it

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
publishes them

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,279
mainly based on the number of

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
contributions and if you look at the

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,000
projects you'll see that a lot of them

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,839
are very interesting so if we have a

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,760
look at it so if we got this year's

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,519

to open source outside the us because

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,839

but you found my channel the other night

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,519
and i was like

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,519
yeah i work quite quite fast at typing

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,880
um but yeah this is great so if anyone

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
is ever doing

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,079
um so i'll turn off my dark mode on this

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,480
one

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,720
so if anyone is ever doing a

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,760
presentation on open source

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,760
you can get all the really really cool

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
data from the state of the octopus

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,920
obviously this is

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,800
github um definitely what aussies

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
contributing

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,079
yeah um but yeah like these are like

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
some of the

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
people that have some of the big

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
companies that got involved in open

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,600
source people go

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
or open source that's just a community

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
thing it's like

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
the number one single biggest

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,279
contributor to open source

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,040
in the world right now is microsoft so

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
if people think that like companies

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,519
don't contribute to open source

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,959
like this say otherwise um here we go

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,720
the state octopus looks a little

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,120
pretty when i take it out of dark mode

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,120
hey um so this is really cool so it's

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,279
got like a heap of stuff on it

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,959
so it talks about our team our trends

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,760
and things like that so we look at top

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,880
trending projects so these are the top

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,279
projects so

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
this is like a star which means we would

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,800
have um

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,839
just like published this it usually gets

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
published about

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,560
around about now actually it's around

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
october november is when we publish um

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,200
each year's top 10 projects so you can

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,639
see here folks of 2018

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,800
the top project was um asp.net

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,959
and flutter and the other cool really

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,600
cool thing it says is like

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
these are the top new projects of that

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,399
year

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
um so it's like two have been on the

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,800
list since 2016.

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,680
new to 2019 considering flutter only got

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,440
released to 2000 like the end of 2018 we

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,440
include on 2019

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
um so like you can see there's a bunch

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
of actually and you actually

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,720
somebody asked about home assistant so

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,959
home assistant

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,399
is the top is in the top 10 open source

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
project so whoever asked about home

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,320
assistant

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,440
yeah this is definitely microsoft skill

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
explains the jump

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,760
not necessarily so like microsoft's been

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,040
on there for a little while but it also

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,680
just

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,560
it i think you'll notice a jump when

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
people like

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,480
such a is involved in microsoft because

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,720
they start looking at the value of the

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
community and the value of open source

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,160
um oh wow home assistant is what got you

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,639
into open source

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,800
that is so cool github is still relevant

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,680
of course github is still relevant

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,120
um yeah vs code so microsoft's vs code

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,399
is open source so all those people who

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,240
are using vs code

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,160
are like insane but also look at the

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,959
difference so the top two

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
open source projects on github are both

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,519
microsoft so

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,199
that total me and my maths um

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,680
totaling 35 000 or 33 000 contributors

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,880
to both those two projects so azure docs

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
for anyone who doesn't know about azure

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,760
docs

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,680
yes open source um and it's just miles

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,920
ahead of everyone else so 19.1

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,279
000 contributors to vs code is insane

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,600
techy man you've built an extension for

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,360
vs code so you can technically say

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,560
you've contributed to the biggest open

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,880
source project

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,399
in the world at least on github um so

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,160
obviously i've got flutter as a big one

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,160
that's up there tensorflow

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
obviously it's google's tensorflow

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
facebook's up there

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,279
kubernetes is up there and schools up

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,880
there definitely type does that and

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,000
obviously home assistant that you

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,000
mentioned

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,519
um ik for as well so

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,199
yeah so um demise who just popped in

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
what where do we mean we are talking

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,800
about open source

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,160
um for hacktoberfest and stuff but a

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,680
couple people asked about open source

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,279
projects and things like that so i look

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,680
at the state of the octopus

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,480
so the state of octopus is a website

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,759
that github

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,560
maintains and um produces and

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,880
contributes to each each bulb i mean the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,560
stats are regularly updated

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
but it's basically got a lot of

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
information about like the top

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,880
open source projects um the open source

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,480
and the interconnected community

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
it's got a whole bunch of information

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,839
about um different regions

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
as well so let's have a look at one of

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,320
the regions that are here uh but also

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,600
it talks about which is what i just had

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,320
before

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
um like there's graphs and stats and

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
stuff on like the contributors to open

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,880
source

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,079
um as i mentioned before different

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,199
companies who are getting involved in

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,639
open source

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,120
but if you look at this so this is what

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,800
we have like um contributions from the

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
us and then contributions from outside

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,639
the us

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
which is amazing to see again as a

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,759
non-us

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
person i like to like you know beat the

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,759
us every now and then

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,600
um so it's really good that like the

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
amount of contributions coming from

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
outside the us

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,959
uh you know have jumped massively and

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
these are the contributions by region

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,240
outside the us

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
have a look at like the growers of open

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,720
source communities

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,399
um africa so nigeria is like massively

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,240
growing which is awesome

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,880
a bunch of places across like um a park

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
which i love because uh i'm from

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,360
australia

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,600
so yeah um so

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
australia is the apac zone so that's why

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
i like seeing some of the apac stuff

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,079
here

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
um and yeah like there's a whole bunch

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,039
of stuff growing so

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,160
like here is insane hong kong singapore

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,799
japan

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,240
like the percentage growth for

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,439
persistence projects

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
this is contributors um so it's really

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,079
cool to see them and then we've

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,839
obviously got the overall contributors

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,760
here

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,319
um this is from asia region so go to us

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,400
in apac

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,679
and there's oh there's oceana down there

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,799
as well so

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,160
um oceano is obviously a lot smaller um

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,280
we have a lot less people compared to

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
the rest of asia so asia's um hong kong

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
singapore

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
indonesia like that malaysia that kind

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,080
of area and oceana

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,200
is uh being new zealand australia

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,679
um possibly

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
yeah yeah i know oceana's us but asia is

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,720
my region as well let's sorry

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,960
when we say apac so that's asia pacific

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,559
so that's these two areas together so

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,799
obviously we're a little bit small

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,240
but yeah oceana is us yes yeah papua new

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,120
guinea is included and that is up

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,880
you are right um so yeah there's a whole

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,240
bunch of really cool stats in here so as

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,840
i mentioned if anyone is

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,280
ever doing a presentation on open source

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
about statistics

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
growth of open source top open source

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,280
projects etc

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,880
there is what you want to see is this

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
day the octopus and every year we

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
publish the top 10

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
open source projects on github and as i

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,799
mentioned

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
the top ones currently currently as in

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,799
like we

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,400
published these i as i said it's about

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,919
now it's sometime between october and

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
november because we usually release it

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,840
around um

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,320
universe time so this will get this is

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,400
the

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,200
2019 ones the 2021s will go up very very

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,039
soon so it's an amazing resource sorry

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,360
you're all welcome all right well let's

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,480
get into oktoberfest because we're here

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,039
to talk about

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,200
first i'm keen to see how many people

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,400
here actually

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,799
have heard about oktoberfest for one

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,760
and secondly have contributed or been

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,799
involved in hector fest in the meantime

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:14,080
um can you i don't know actually just

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,080
look at it i mean

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,600
you can probably like most of your

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,039
developers you

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,720
figure out how to get stuff out of them

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,000
or screenshot them

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,799
either way you

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,360
started contributing to open uh first

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,360
yes

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,480
is there a way to know which projects

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,280
originate from rich region that is a

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,679
really good idea um

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,039
let's have a quick look again this is me

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,360
just doing some digging right now

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,799
one thing i like to look up is our obs

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,400
so if anyone doesn't know

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,840
i am using um obs or my

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,600
broadcasting and obs is another open

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,440
source

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,440
um project i'm going to put it in dark

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,400
modes all those who are watching me use

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,559
github

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,760
in dark mode this is uh a plug-in

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,200
for chrome called dark reader

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
okay so let's have a look to see if we

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,760
can work out where they originate from i

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,960
know we can see

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,240
like contributors and languages so this

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
is a really really good

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,280
we'll talk about this when we talk a

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
little bit about contributing to october

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
1st

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,320
uh but one of the cool things about uh

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
looking at repos is you can look at the

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,400
languages

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,919
so if you were a c program or a c

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,240
plus post programmer and you were

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
looking at obs this would be a really

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,760
good project for you

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,120
if you're more into like python or java

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,679
you'd probably go

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,679
probably not necessarily my thing

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,159
because it's mostly built on c and c

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,159
plus plus

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,080
mhm dark reader is also open source as

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
well

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,400
um yeah i'm unsure many insights

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,840
let's have a look contributors

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,000
ah that's total commits

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,919
i don't know if we can see obviously

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
there is a way to view it by region but

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,840
i don't know if

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,840
we can get that by just looking at it

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,039
but look there's a bunch of insights um

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
so if you ever go to a project go to

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:29,039
insights tab here

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,640
and well no no project would ever be

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,720
completely regional but you might get

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
projects like you'd be able to see the

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,559
amount of contributors

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,960
from a region right so that's why we say

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,200
when we look at again i'll just turn off

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,159
this dark reader in this mode um so if

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,159
you look at like the number of

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,080
contributors and stuff

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,760
um it would probably be based on the

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,520
maintainer actually that was probably

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,159
something i'd want to look up because if

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
you look

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,159
on these daily octopus um this is

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,640
percentage of growth of

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,400
open source projects these regions

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
powered open source grows from around

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,120
the world

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
okay so that's project cells in people

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,760
second i was going there creating

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,960
probably goes

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,799
and have the four as possible i would

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,720
i would i will double check that for you

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,679
actually yeah so be

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,559
that's what i was thinking be the

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,440
repository owner slash the maintainers

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,960
whereas here is all contributors so i'm

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,320
not sure

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,640
if there is a way to actually see where

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,400
um the percentage of a project like from

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,480
a public-facing point of view obviously

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,679
i can get the data um

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,039
i'm not sure if there's a way to do it

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,280
but like there is a whole bunch of

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
really cool insights from here anyway

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,039
um to say like you know this is the

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,840
community profile

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,280
um of obs again we're gonna be talking

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
about this more because we're gonna

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,720
actually having obs maintainers on an

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
open source stream

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,159
open source friday stream so don't go

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
too much into it um

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,120
but what i really like about the

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,120
community profile is you can see like

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,000
all the things that they've got

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,919
um you can look at commits to be made

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,919
you can look at the frequency

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,000
so how often is the project being

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,640
committed to deleted from

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,159
um so obviously it had a lot in the

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
early days that's when it was first done

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,720
but you can see like

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
for example if you're wanting to be

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,760
involved in open source project you want

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
to know

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,799
how often people are actually

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,640
contributing to

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
the project how often it's being updated

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,440
and maintained so here this is

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
relatively

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,960
i mean obviously when it first started

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,720
you're going to have lots this is

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,480
relatively steady right and then these

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,679
big spikes are probably when they had

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
major releases

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,679
but you can see it's relatively steadily

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,679
maintained and contributed to

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,960
we've got the different dependencies if

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
you're into that kind of thing

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,279
oh here we go this is the most recent

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,679
commits by timeline

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,960
it's just loading data again there's so

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,919
much cool stuff you can get out of

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,279
github

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,400
it's really awesome

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,400
loading loading loading

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,400
yes there you go anything

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,120
like this oh it's just gonna click and

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
do it again

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,919
but yeah there's like pretty cool stuff

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,000
you can see like how many times it's

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,480
been forked whose fork yeah who's using

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
it

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
that kind of stuff you see obviously

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
over your studio there you go all these

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
people like it

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,200
look how many people like using obs

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,480
studio and like doing their own builds

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,360
wow wow

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
that's insane

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,159
it's it's pretty crazy all right so back

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,400
to october first

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,880
so october 1st was started as we

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,520
mentioned uh seven years ago

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,279
since its seventh year and the idea is

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,600
to get people contributing to open

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
source

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,760
so who here so a bunch of you have ruby

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,960

good all good

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,720
uh that's it it's just hot we we just

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,000
need to keep an eye on people you know

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
what people like when they jump

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
in and start posting links left right

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,799
and center it gets crazy

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,600
all right so okay well i'm gonna go with

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,000
ruby because demise said ruby seems

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,080
dead so if i was demise and i was like

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,760
hey i'm a ruby developer ruby seems a

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,559
little bit dead i want to go contribute

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,159
to

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,840
a ruby repository i got no idea where to

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,440
start most of the time right most people

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,919
go i don't know where to start

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
so if i click here and go okay we'll

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,600
just start hacking

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,840
okay well first of all you gotta log on

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
um so if you haven't done that do that

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,880
um but one of the things you can do

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,720
you'll probably get here and go

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,159
hmm there's a lot of stuff right

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,679
and if you go like ruby

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,399
open source projects

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,760
okay here's some trending ones so this

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,600
might be a

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
kind of way to go okay this place to

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
start okay so here's some training oh

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,679
look

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,279
look at that digital ocean is even

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,279
trending

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,240
up to manage annual open source

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:49,039
challenge there you go

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:52,399
that's a training repository right now

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,039
and look 56.9 percent of it was built on

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,919
ruby

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,799
so ruby is not dead uh what else is ruby

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,440
for good

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,960
to institute um so you can always look

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,760
at trending stuff

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,520
um so obviously because i googled that

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,799
um it's going to come up but basically

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,279
the way you get to it

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,559
so if you log into your github and

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,840
you're on github

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,559
you go to actual profile not github

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,240
github

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,320
in your profile and actually or i can

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:30,399
just go here github.com

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:31,520
trending oops not to get emoji

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,360
so there you go so if you're like

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
github.com trending this will be all the

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,559
trending projects from github

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,640
now right now it's obviously searching

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,159
by the top trending project

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,240
which means it's got 514 stars today

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,360
um 30 days of react challenge okay

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,720
that's probably why

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,559
now if you go demise

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,159
i want ruby you can type in here you can

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,960
filter by ruby which is what we did just

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,640
before

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,159
so i can filter by ruby and it should

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,520
filter and we can see all the ruby

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,760
projects here

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,039
so these are what's trending so

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,960
obviously it doesn't have nearly as many

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,559
stuff although it's got 109 stars on the

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,559
october 1st one i'm totally going to

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,159
style that by the way

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,559
stop start everything top tip for github

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,640
start absolutely everything um so i can

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,000
look here go repositories

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,520
or i could go demise you know what

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,559
i actually want to go back to ruby

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,840
i actually want to get to know some

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,480
other ruby developers

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,679
so i can look at top trending developers

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,120
as well

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,120
and i can search by ruby

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,799
and go cool this person

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,520
builds interactive charts for ruby this

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,200
person

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,240
is ruby faster um and we can look at

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,840
them and go

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
let's just go here

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,279
okay look at him go whoa okay all his

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,600
stuff is roomy well five nine thousand

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,039
contributions what the heck

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,720
and we can go all right let's have a

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
look at what he's actually contributed

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,039
to

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,679
okay informers home core okay this seems

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,360
pretty good

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,360
so go okay this might be a project to

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,399
contribute to

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,159
some of this might be a little bit

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,360
long-winded but this is that's one way

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,200
to set for a project you might want okay

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,200
um okay if i go back to here

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,600
so that's that search term for ruby if

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,159
you'd like it um so you can do that

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
right

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,600
so that's one way to search for stuff

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,760
another cool way to search for stuff is

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,679
if you go to the hacktoberfest website

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,559
they've helped you out as well so you

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,720
can go here and go okay let's look

00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:45,120
specifically for oktoberfest projects

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
because

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,360
this year as well we made some changes

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,200
to october 1st so oktoberfest is opt-in

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,360
only now so you have to make sure that a

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,320
repo that you're contributing to

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
is opt-in um so you want to make sure

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
they've got the hacktoberfest label so

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,960
we'll make sure that

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,600
but okay you you want to do some ruby

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,200
let's have a look at what ruby

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,440
okay there's one main one so this is

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,039
actually the one that we saw here

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,320
so um sasuka

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,840
ruby for good so if we go back to that

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,120
like that lines up really well right so

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
if we go here go okay well

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
that's that's why that project is

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
trending on

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,919
ruby right is because people are

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,080
contributing there's no stars today but

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,159
people are obviously contributing to it

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,840
so if we look back at there we go

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,760
so we clicked in here it doesn't open my

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,440
new tab but we clicked in here

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,600
so this is ruby for good and sasuka okay

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:46,000
so if we go so when i clicked on

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,000
this one here yeah

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,120
come on

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,480
i just remove the filter and go back

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,600
again it's just taking its sleep time

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,039
internet in australia

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,200
so if you click that it takes you

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,039
directly to this volunteers are

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,760
scientists supervisors should display by

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,519
default

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,960
okay i only want to see this this is

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,080
like uh

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,720
can i help this issue a passing test i'm

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,600
happening is there's a whole lot of

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,120

they've got a project board which is

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,080
awesome we'll go check that out

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,720
um what i really like about this is if

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
you're

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,440
ever looking for an open source project

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,640
to contribute to whether it's

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
hacktoberfest

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,360
or whether it's any other time of the

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,360
year a contribution guide

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,720
is really really good there's a lot of

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,840
projects you have these

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,159
and this is it and all it is is telling

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,679
you

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,839
as a contributor what's kind of expected

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,679
of you but what is the culture of that

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,200
particular open source project

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,280
and this is really good so this isn't

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,440
saying you know we love contributors

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,119
if i participate so you agree to buy buy

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,960
the cody condom so i got a code contacts

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,839
as well you can request to join the

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,919
slack

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,679
uh and then here is like basic steps

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:26,800
right to submit a pull request and it's

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,079
just got like a little bit of

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,200
information now

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,800
as a first time contributor whether

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,480
you're contributing first time

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,000
ever or whether you're contributing

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,679
first time to this repo

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
you know exactly what to do you know

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
like what to do

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
you know it even says here like to claim

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,159
an issue comment on it

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,679
 a repo do it okay machine follow

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,599
these steps for this guy because tell

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,919
you exactly what you need to do

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,639
um so something like this is really good

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,000
now let's have a look at their

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,920
wow that's a lot of we'll have a look at

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that in a minute

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,280
so this is their project board for um

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,440
ruby for good and what i really like is

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,160
when project boards are like this right

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
like as a contributor i can come in and

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,480
go

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,079
okay there's a lot of stuff right but if

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,760
i just take a step back and go all right

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,240
let's have a look what's happening

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,320
all right there's a to-do list here all

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,490
right so demise you

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,920
wanted to know a little bit about um

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,560
[Music]

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
you know israeli dead how to contribute

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,480
i would start here okay there's a to-do

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,760
list

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,480
and look these ones are tagged with

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,520
hockey first priority medium okay

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,960
well that's medium priorities so if i'm

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,240
new i probably don't want to go for high

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,079
priority because they're going to need

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,960
that done straight away

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,320
um but it is good that like for example

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
this one here's another one it's a

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,280
medium

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,680
priority it's just a small bug fix but

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,960
looks of it uh it's tagged with october

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,920
1st so it's probably going to be really

00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,200
good anything tagged with

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
oktoberfest so it's probably going to be

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,599
a really good first time contributor

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,280
issue

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,720
sending here is really good right so

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,560
i'll link this board to you so you can

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,720
have a look

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,040
now what i really like is something that

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,200
ikfa's brought up right which is even if

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,839
you don't code

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,320
or you don't go very much you can

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,880
contribute in

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,720
so many ways without just actually

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,280
coding like look at this one

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,400
create three gifs of navigating stages

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,040
as a volunteer

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,839
and add them to the readme so this here

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,240
they've even tagged it with

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,880
documentation so

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,640
i can look at that and go oh sweet i

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,720
might not be very good at ruby

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,000
i just started learning ruby i'm okay at

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,720
it but i'm not great

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,880
i can go sweet that's what i can do

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,440
because all i need to do is actually

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,920
like sure i have some knowledge of ruby

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
um

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,200
but i can just go on here and go oh

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,280
sorry i can create some gifts now

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,520
someone's already got this one and said

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,040
i can do this and then there are

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,720
specific things you want to capture just

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,480
the basic difference in your face

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,800
so this is perfect they're asking

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,200
they're saying yep i've claimed this one

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,640
and a little bit of clarification now

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,760
what i really like about project boards

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,240
is we can filter by

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
cars so if you say i i'm a new

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,839
contributor i only want to see

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,839
oktoberfest stuff

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
so i only want to see stuff that's

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
labeled with hacktoberfest

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
so i'm going sweet look at all the stuff

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,320
i have trouble first i can do

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,480
i can have a look at

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
this i mean half these clothes it's

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,040
merged to

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,280
qr so i probably wanted to look at this

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,040
one and stay on this to-do list

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
or i might want to have a look at other

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,760
people's ones go right let's see what

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,280
other people are doing

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,400
and go right this person's doing

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,720
some report filters uh let's go have a

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
look

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,160
and so this is what i like about really

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
good products and products that are

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,240
still going

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,160
is you can have a look at it and go all

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,839
right what are other people doing like

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
how should i be involved so this one's

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,440
going okay this is the

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,119
issue that's open someone's going yep

00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,839
does it involve jealousy or it's simply

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,839
rails

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,160
simply rails not even using filter

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,480
prolific

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,960
so that's cool right so there you go

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,680
demise i just proved to you that ruby is

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,320
not dead

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,760
and i prove to you a bunch of ways you

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,240
can contribute to ruby

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,599
this hacktoberfest right someone give me

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,000
another language we'll have a look at

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,240
another

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:33,839

example of a really good docs one

00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,920
packtoberfest is here start hacking um

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,520

i'll link it here as well

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,000
so i wrote this blog post after my

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,599
interview

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,599
week four asked and this uh

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,119
paul cobblestone from super bass did a

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,079
similar kind of project board we just

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,359
looked at

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,040
um for first contributions now if we

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,560
look uh let's make sure i've got dark

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,910
mode off on this

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,929
there we go

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,929
[Music]

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,240
all right go back give me the project

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,240
board

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,079
definitely link to it where is it i'll

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,839
find it on superface

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
you don't know ruby that's all right you

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,800
can have a look at that docs one though

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,880
i showed you

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,760
um go to it on github please

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,160
so you're asking about docs um so doc's

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,079
one

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,599
is really cool so these guys super base

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,000
which is an open source

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,599
alternative to firebase if you have the

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,920
project board

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,680
so this is a really really cool one to

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,359
look at um

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,000
a little bit different but if you look

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,640
at this this is what i love

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,960
about people like paul so he's he's

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,440
realized straight away that coding

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,800
and project isn't always about the

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,560
development work

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,960
um even though they've obviously um

00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,720
split out their dev work by small

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
engineering tasks and large engineering

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,520
tasks

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,480
but i've also got columns here for

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,839
designers

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,000
so if you want to improve a logo

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,119
or design a new system or build a

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,720
component library

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,440
or you know build a new login

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,160
screen there's design work here um if

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,119
you are

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,720
as demain said a writer and you want to

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,040
contribute to docs

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,720
look here there's a whole like level for

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,880
docs contributions add instructions for

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,880
listening to low-level changes

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,800
um other server responses for our

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,680
document um improve our comments in the

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,520
docs

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,200
um add a section for authorization and

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,200
policies

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,440
yeah yeah this is it here um so i just

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,760
linked to the project and then here is

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
the

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,359
actual thing and if you

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,280
missed it i think we've already uploaded

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,200
it to youtube

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,200
if you missed my interview with him

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,480
you can find it and let's say they might

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,280
not have put it up yet

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,280
i know they have

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,680
oh look it's me again well there you go

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,800
there is our um interview with paul

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,359
cobblestone from super bass so here he

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
is

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,280
um so for those it looks so funny it's

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,599
like a double screen uh so for those of

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
you

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,400
in the oceana time zone paul is

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,200
originally a kiwi and he's the ceo

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,920
founder and

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,079
um core maintainer of super bass which

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,359
is as i just said the open source social

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,200
media to firebase

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,280
um so i like the fact that he is

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,800
he's from our side of the pond he's

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
living in singapore at the moment though

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,160
but he's um built this really cool

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,920
thing with his team and a bunch of other

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,960
contributors and if you'd like to

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,720
contribute to them

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,119
for hacktoberfest you can um and i think

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,800
they are also giving out their own swag

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,640
as well for people who make really good

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,240
contributions to their

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,160
um their stuff so really cool

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,920
so chubby freak you didn't know github

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,119
had an official twitch

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,520
we sure do this is the official

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,880
github twitch channel welcome in thanks

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,319
for following

00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,599

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,960
like i'm fine but you have followed so

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,160
alrighty so somebody asked about

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,319
javascript cronic okay so if you are a

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,000
first time

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,640
comer to october 1st or a first time

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,839
person wanting to contribute and you

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,240
don't know where to start

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,480
so again we could go through a similar

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,160
process that we just did

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,160
we can do python in a minute i will do

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,839
five in a minute because i've got a good

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,440
example for python

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,760
okay so we could go through a similar

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,520
process that we just did

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,800
let me get rid of some of these things

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,960
there's the github swap if you wanted

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,319
um okay so we can go through a very

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,319
similar process

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,359
so if you wanted to look at all right

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,319
what's trending

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,319
in javascript today

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,119
all right so we've got 30 days of react

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,440
we've got react hooks

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,760
3 2 processing there's a code

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,359
then there's a javascript so there's a

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,960
whole bunch of stuff training in

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,640
javascript

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,280
yeah so look at home assistant don't

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,079
worry um so this is one way to find it

00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
remember

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,960
um and this is a really good way to do

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,599
it obviously if hacktoberfest isn't

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,359
running

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,960
when you're wanting to contribute um but

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
if we have a look at the hacktoberfest

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,280
issues

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
specifically because remember how trevor

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,599
first is opt-in only now

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,119
if we go to javascript and we look at

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,160
all the javascript projects

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,599
we can see okay oh this one's cool um

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,440
so again i'm a gamer i have a

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,960
twitch channel my own twitch channel i

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,400
obviously have a discord channel

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,359
so let's have a look at this because

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,359
it's a discord bot

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,359
i'm also gonna so obviously java is like

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,280
wait what

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
sick get off jersey thank you we've had

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,079
lots of people comment on the jersey

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,880
um so i'm glad you'd like it because i i

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,240
designed it

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,640
and b we may be bringing cool

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,760
more swag like this to you guys soon

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,200
guys and girls

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,200
um so that is the github

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,800
shop if you haven't got your own swag

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,319
before because

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,079
the swag is pretty cool i've actually

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,560
got a bunch of these ship at pins which

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,720
are

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,079
like amazing hey sticker player how are

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,000
you

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:07,119
okay so back to javascript so if we

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,240
it does this when you like refresh so go

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,280
back to javascript

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,720
i also want to check out that a readme

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,800
profile as well we'll check out this

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,480
github readme profile

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,119
okay so there's two things i picked up

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,599
for javascript so

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,880
this command has a bug in the following

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,400
results all right let's have a look at

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,560
this spot

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
okay so list spot so this is it takes

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,119
you here because that is the first

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,440
good issue that you should check out

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,319
yeah so not everyone has a project board

00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
demise

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,560
um not everyone even knows about github

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,920
project boards which is i find very

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
interesting because i love the github

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
project

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,599
but what they do have which is what i'm

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,640
going to show you is

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,480
good first issues so good first issues

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,800
are the perfect place to start

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,839
with a project if you're a first-time

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,280
contributor

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,960
so you can have a look here in the

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
issues actually all the issues at the

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,000
moment

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,720
are labeled good first issues so good

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,319
first issues mean that that issue

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,160
is the perfect issue to try out if

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,280
you're either a first-time contributor

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,800
to open source

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
or if you're a first time contributor to

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,599
the project

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,880
now i had a maintainer on it was the

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,880
maintainer of

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,760
who did i have i've had i've had too

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,200
many people on

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,079
recently but one of the maintainers of

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,960
one of the projects i had on recently

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,960
um project boards are exactly they're

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,079
kanban boards which is orca bomb boards

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,839
however you'd like to see them

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
which is exactly what a trailer board is

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,839
or a project board

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,119
um it's the same thing it's a kanban

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,000
board but you can do whatever you want

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,560
with it i'll show you

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,319
project boards in a minute actually uh

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,839
so i asked a maintainer

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,160
recently on one of our open source

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,040
friday streams how do you choose a good

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,280
first issue

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,280
as the maintainer and what do you choose

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,720
as a good first issue like what makes it

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,960
a good first issue

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,880
one of the things was like oh it's

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,480
something that's easy

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,200
for someone to come in and it's

00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,200
something that is that shows the culture

00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,960
and the community of the project

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,319
and allows them to easily understand

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,800
what the project is

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,720
and what the maintainer said was any of

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,960
the good first issues here

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,880
any of the maintainers could just as

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,040
easily fix these things

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,119
and i was like oh okay so

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,400
[Music]

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,119
that that's the thing and they're like

00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,359
yeah but because we can easily fix them

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,040
we can easily help people with them so

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,480
they said we purposely

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,000
leave easy things in good first issues

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,319
so people can come along

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,280
and give it a shot and we can be there

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,079
to help them

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
i was like that is amazing so even as a

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,400
first-time contributor and i was like so

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,119
actually want people to come in and try

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
stuff they're like yeah that's why we

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,800
have good first issues

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,760
we want people to come in we want people

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,119
to give it a crack

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,599
and we want people to just try

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,280
you know having a go about contributing

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,319
to open source and we as maintainers

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,640
will be there to help

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,480

maintainers but i know a lot of

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,520
maintainers have this

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,319
um this mentality and this attitude

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,079
that if you want to learn something you

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,520

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,720
these people not only contribute to the

00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,800
project but also learn the

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,319
pro coding language to contribute to a

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,680
project and he's like yeah

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:53,040
i was like wow so this is

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,400
what i absolutely love about open source

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,960
i'm going to go full screen there's a

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,480
bit but i absolutely love this about

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,079
open source is that

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:04,640
the community is just here to be

00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,119
amazing and the community is here to

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,440
help

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,040
each other out and so he's like someone

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,480
asked me like oh how did

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,160
how do people get into programming i'm

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,280
like ask a lot of people they get into

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,920
it because they

00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,200
like find a language they're interested

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,480
in and then they just go and start

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,839
contributing to a

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,520
project and they get involved in open

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:25,040
source and they learn from other people

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,800
like what is the best way to learn

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,280
stuff it's usually to learn from other

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,760
people like anyone here in the chat

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,200
who's ever been to a hackathon like an

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,160
irl hackathon

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,599
like a physically focused hackathon you

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,079
have a problem you're like oh

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,839
i'm stuck with something someone in your

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,119
team will help you someone from another

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,559
team will come and help you

00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,720
and this is what i love about the

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,640
community right i know someday we'll

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,720
have irl hackathons again

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,920
but this is what i love and the open

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,280
source community

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,960
does this exactly so if you're there and

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,079
you say hey i need some help with this

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,520
people are going to come in and help

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,599
you and this is just what i love about

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,559
this is the reason how oktoberfest was

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,640
started

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,079
so people can come in and contribute to

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,880
projects and learn

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,559
from others and like learn how to you

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,440
know be part of this community that's

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,040
just here to help them to learn

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,640
so dustin you're in a programmed boot

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,200
camp and community is the only thing to

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,440
get you through

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,880
exactly like if you don't have community

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,839
you got nothing

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,240
anyway let's go back to the

00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,000
hacktoberfesting um

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,640
for javascript so again you want to

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,119
contribute to this list but

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,359
there's some good ways to do it right um

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,800
the other one i picked up was

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:43,119
github profile readme generator um

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,079
which is actually what a brand new thing

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,760
that just got uh

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,520
released it's actually going out in our

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,200
release radar in a couple of days so

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,119
keep an eye out for that

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:55,760
uh but this is also javascript

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:57,760
so again go back to the main profile or

00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,079
the main um project

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,880
we look down the side we see that it is

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,720
a 95.8 percent javascript

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,559
they do typescript within css that would

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,880
be just the you know the beautifying bit

00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,400
so you can have profile review this just

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,240
got released

00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,280
and they are already asking people to

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:19,119
contribute to it for hack truck first

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,319
so it's you can see it's tagged as um

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,440
oktoberfest on the side here

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,440

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,720
we go cool they've got good first issues

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,880
remember

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,559
um fun facts you can search by stuff so

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,920

just t just that's why that's why i did

00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,640
this so you see i wasn't pressing any

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:08,839
other buttons no fancy magic just t

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:13,119
um okay now you want to see projects

00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,920

like to do all my things alright so if i

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,359
go to projects i've got a demo project

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,920
ready here to go demo board for my demoy

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,119
thing

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,559
sorry i just started this the other day

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,440
because someone asked me about project

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,319
boards

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,640
um so basically what you can do is you

00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,880
can

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,920
see this one show us camber boards so

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:51,200
basically you can

00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,559
change move columns you can update the

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,280
names you can filter by

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:57,520
cards you can add columns you can move

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,640
things around on different columns you

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,799
can add

00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,839
issues you can add like things twitch

00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:05,450
streams

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:08,530
we are talking about

00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,530
[Applause]

00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,319
that's just like a label or like a bit

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,920
of text

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:21,839
i can go in here and drop a new issue

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,839
and go feature request

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,119
let's just leave all these other things

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:35,839
here just

00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:35,839
i had no idea

00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:41,760
[Applause]

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:45,760
maybe add this as a tip

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,440
submit and i've got the issue here

00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,680
let's just the fonzies add a couple

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,480
labels to it

00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,480
enhancement

00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:01,200
let's add a new label as well

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:05,359
new label switch

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,180
and let's make it purple create label

00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,680
and then if we go back to my issue

00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:12,400
[Music]

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:16,799
t for search and we can add another

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,720
label in here

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,720
cool and then what you can do is you can

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,599
copy and paste this issue that you just

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,079
created you can

00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,599
dump it on the on the project board

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,280
i'm saying go like that whoops i

00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,200
actually added it in twice

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,720
and then add it give you this little

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,480
like

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,240
preview and so you can click it and

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,640
you'll see it pop up over here

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,000
and you can see there's labels and

00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,760
everything i can do all like

00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,440
really quick and easy things from here

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
so i can click just quickly click and

00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,000
decide myself

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,000
um i can click here and set a milestone

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,640
i can close the issue from here i can

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,520
quickly edit the issue from here as well

00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,200
like this and i can go to the full issue

00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,880
for details and see all the comments and

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,880
everything if i needed to

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,520
and so yeah that's project boards which

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,559
is really really awesome

00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,680
okay now someone asked for python all

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,599
right

00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,000
this will be the last one we do i think

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,319
because oh it depends if people want me

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,599
to

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,599
keep doing market keep doing more

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,960
okay let's just go over that and see if

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,160
there's

00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,480
python all right so let's go

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,799
for the original way first so let's go

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,640
have a look at the trending

00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,640
python projects of today

00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,599
and python so i've got a bug flying

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,839
around my room

00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,839
okay give it a second to load up oh okay

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,520
let's have a look python is a rich or

00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,440
rich is a python library

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,760
yeah rich actually just released a new

00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,160
update as well last month

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,000
so here we've got rich we've got data

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,160
sets we've obviously got

00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,680
algorithms with python 30 days of python

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,359
instagram

00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:06,839
a brute force attack for instagram

00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,319
so you can see python is obviously a lot

00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,240
more

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,839
popular than ruby as demise figured out

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,480
now if we want to find issues that

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:18,720
specifically for the october first one

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,839
um we can pick one of these and we can

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,839
click browse more in github as well

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:32,079
so these will be all the github

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:36,880
so wow 39 000

00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:41,839
issues yes ethical hacking 100

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:44,680
uh okay so this is all the issues

00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,240
that are tagged with hacktoberfest so

00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,960
[Music]

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,960
basically

00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,799
this is everything you need to find if

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,760
you want to contribute to oktoberfest

00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,040
now obviously there's a lot you go

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,920
i don't know why i'm looking for these

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,000
39 000 issues that's a lot of issues

00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,640
if you go okay you start searching my

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,559
language it starts getting a lot smaller

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,480
um obviously we've just got the open

00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,400
issues here so there are closed issues

00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,440
there's like a thousand closed issues

00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,760
already

00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,200
um but we could look very specifically

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,920
at things as well we could look at

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,079
packages

00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,280
topics um we look at the marketplace so

00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,960
there's nothing there

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,040
um but issues the main thing we want to

00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,799
look at and

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,319
oh actually this one's really good so

00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,319
postgres

00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,079
highly recommend um but if again if you

00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,920
want to look for python

00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,200
okay there's only six and a half

00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,440
thousand issues

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,680
a whole bunch of those issues are

00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,839
probably most likely

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,200
from a bunch of projects rather than

00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,240
that's obviously not six and a half

00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,079
thousand projects so

00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,319
six and a half thousand issues so you

00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,720
can look through here and go right

00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,359
script to scrapper to scrape a community

00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,720
website

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,520
sweet i could do that um paginator what

00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,720
does it do

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,839
page by interaction we need it so

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,599
okay cool i could do that uh more

00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:05,599
algorithms contribute words

01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:07,359
there you go who wanted a documentation

01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,839
one before

01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,760
you can contribute by adding common

01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:17,200
youtube keywords to terms dot text

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:20,559
how easy is that god if

01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,760
somebody is into i mean it's tagged with

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,520
python

01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,799
because it's probably part of a python

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,119
project

01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,000
but if you want to contribute and it's

01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,480
how trevor first

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,680
good first issue it's up for grabs

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,240
charlie go do it

01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,079
so you can see somebody mentioned it 27

01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,200
minutes ago and it's already updated

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:41,440
let's go have a look at it actually

01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:45,520
let's go do something huh pewdiepie

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:49,280
wow look at all the top issues

01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,280
fortnite fortnite apple

01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,559
so what we probably want to do first is

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,520
we want to go have a look what this

01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,599
youtube higher lower theme first is

01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,680
higher lower game with youtube video

01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,240
accounts you can continue adding common

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,359
words

01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:09,680
to the term well let's add in all the

01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:11,760
first words so if i wanted to contribute

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,720
let's what you would do first is make

01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,280
sure there's nothing

01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:21,520
at first okay there's no oktoberfest

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:25,839
sweet let's add into

01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,839
the best

01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:39,040
[Applause]

01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,200
so you want to make sure that the stuff

01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,079
you're adding is not already there as

01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,000
well

01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,170
so this is a big thing when you're

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,359
looking for um

01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,440
[Applause]

01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,839
so open source is i was like it's

01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,970
already there that was me

01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:56,100
um

01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,100
[Music]

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,599
hipster hackathon

01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,119
pack it does all seem to be involved

01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,319
okay

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,319
yes we need to do that

01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,200
hustler hipster yup see this

01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,039
is what i love about the community you

01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,480
are all telling me how to fix my code

01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,520
already

01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:27,839
i actually wrote an article on dev2

01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:29,039
about how terrible i am at like spelling

01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,880
and grammar

01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,319
okay so i've added those ones in but

01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,240
before i make

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,440
a pull request i want to do the right

01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,720
thing

01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,720
and make sure i haven't

01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:44,160
i haven't like added stuff that's

01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:46,640
already there

01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,960
it looks like most of the stuff added is

01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,960
not

01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,559
no so this is the thing right so this

01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:58,480
person has

01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,920
actually said dot pass that they

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,280
actually want this

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,720
so there are a lot of spammy pr's right

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,200
um there are a lot of spammy pull

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,240
requests but for this one

01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,640
they're actually asking you to do this

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,920
so if we go back to and this is the

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,119
maintainer right

01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,200
so jack this is his project he

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,319
wants to contribute where's october he's

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,559
that you can contribute

01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,240
in common youtube words so it's actually

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,559
labeled with

01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,319
october 1st good first issue and not for

01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,839
grabs so he's actually warning people to

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:32,720
contribute to this

01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,280
which is one of the big things so if we

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,079
look at

01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,440
so i'm going to contribute to this first

01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,960
um

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,960
added search

01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,839
terms specifically

01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:54,720
[Applause]

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:57,680
so when you make your when you make um

01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,599
changes or whatever you want to actually

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,039
like i always put these in and then put

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,319
like a nice little description

01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:07,039
and then propose these changes

01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:08,640
league of legends pokemony um now i can

01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,400
create a pull request to say

01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:16,000
added these um

01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,200
have these terms um

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,720
double checked

01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:26,480
to make sure they weren't already

01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:28,000
included cool and then i can allow and

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,680
it's my interns obviously and then i'll

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,680
create the full request for this one

01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,799
so it's key to know that

01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,000
obviously there are a lot of people

01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,720
opening up spam right

01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,359
you don't want to open spam which is why

01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,599
we've made

01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,280
projects opt-in only and why we're

01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,400
telling people to go and open

01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,520
issues and be part of

01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,880
um be part for example

01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,640
i went here and i was like okay what

01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,799
does this project do

01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,119
okay it's a higher lower game youtube

01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:02,960
you can contribute adding common youtube

01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,240
um keyword terms it's like okay well

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,200
that seems pretty legit

01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,880
and like easy but also it's pretty

01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
obvious what he's wanting to do and if i

01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,760
look at the issues

01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,880
he's only got one issue open which is

01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,880
that contribute words

01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,839
but he he owns this repo um

01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,640
well he's made a game for it by looks a

01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,000
bit and if we look at it

01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,520
um higher or lower dot pi was made last

01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,680
month we could double check this

01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,799
but he has got he hasn't read me and a

01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,920
license file

01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:50,559
because it's only

01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:52,000
recently that we've added um

01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,119
only but like this look this is

01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,520
legitimate right so this code is here

01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,200
so it's like youtube api key um

01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,160
everything is here you get a score and

01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,160
you can win

01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,760
um from doing this so this is fine from

01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,880
what i'm saying

01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:12,079
i could be wrong but i'm double checking

01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:15,280
um but for example if you went to

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,440
the super base

01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,400
um issue again because some people say

01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,520
so we're going to have to

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,520
first right and we look at

01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,880
uh profile so i've already completed a

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,640
few pull requests there's probably more

01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,319
than four on there now

01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,640
um so if we look down the side here it's

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,240
like okay don't open pull requested

01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,640
minor text edits on other people's

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,079
repositories

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,640
unless they're obviously asking for it

01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,160
right don't feel intimidated so this one

01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,039
here

01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,720
uh updated the readme so i updated a

01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,880
readme file on this hacktoberfest

01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,720
because they specifically asked

01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,559
can people check this for spelling and

01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,240
grammar errors now i'm probably going to

01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,839
do a lot more for oktoberfest than just

01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,640
these four because these are just like a

01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,359
few

01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,799
um they asked for um like for example

01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,240
this is my friend's repo

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:07,680
he's got this really really cool um

01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,280
light array functioning thingamajiggy

01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,760
there's some really cool stuff

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,400
um so i helped him out there and do a

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,640
little bit of

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,680
python coding which i'm not very good at

01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,599
um

01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,000
basically yeah you don't want to do

01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:21,440
minor stuff if it's contributing to the

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,720
core of the project

01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:28,079
or for example like super bass

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:31,680
and you have a look at their

01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,680
documentation back here

01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,280
and look at their products

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,200
and we look at writers okay so these are

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,280
like

01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,240
improved docs comments so if we go to

01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,680
the issue

01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,079
we go all right what are they actually

01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,480
asking for this is the hacked offers

01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:54,640
read more about howtofest on our blog

01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,520
and see the tasks you've never seen

01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,880
jokes before

01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,119
it's the comment to go above the

01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,680
functions for example so what they want

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,480
you to do

01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,880
like this is relatively easy and it's a

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,559
javascript so if you know javascript

01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,319
it's quite easy but what they're just

01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,559
saying to do is they just want you to go

01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,000
through the code and just add a comment

01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,359
on each line on what that thing does

01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,159
obviously you know when you comment out

01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,400
text um so that's like a really cool one

01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,400
right

01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,960
you want to do the four pr's but you

01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,359
have nothing to attribute to than your

01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:39,839
discord bot and website

01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:39,839
what kind of language do you do dot pass

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,000
yeah that's the thing so this one here

01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,560
create fizz bars i actually added like

01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,159
five

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,719
different fizzbuzz solutions in python

01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:54,239
java actually has two python ones and

01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,000
three javascript ones

01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,440
so that's one pull request with like

01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,400
five different changes so that's gonna

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,400
take a while to review

01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,199
sometimes javascript would you reckon

01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,319
that would be a good one for you to do

01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:08,640
dot pass

01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,560
like for example all you need to do is

01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,159
go through the javascript doc you don't

01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,839
need to change the actual code you just

01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:15,279
need to write functions on it

01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,080
and they're wanting people to do this

01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,120
because they're wanting people to

01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,679
contribute

01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,319
um to the project so this one's more for

01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,239
writers

01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,279
so you don't necessarily need to know

01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:25,279
how to do much code

01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:35,520
so that this is a good place to start

01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:38,400
otherwise you can have a look back in

01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,400
oktoberfest

01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,520
have a look at javascript again

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,120
and then we have a look at all the

01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,120
things

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,080
look at this one this one's like we

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,840
actually just want help reviewing the

01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,840
pr's please go through the pull requests

01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,800
and review them if any of them aren't

01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,360
following the rules requests to change

01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,960
sweet

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,120
they're actually getting people to help

01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:16,560
with their pull requests

01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:20,000
um where's another one

01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,000
data to character endpoint

01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:34,159
contribute data for valid characters

01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,159
so that's a cool one

01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,920
and you can have a go right what is

01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,920
final space api

01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:48,560
oh cool i like stuff with cool images

01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,320
if it is a restful api based on the

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,280
television show file space all the time

01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,800
i've seen fire space wiki

01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,600
so there you go it's got instructions on

01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,840
how to do that go to javascript

01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,199
oh it's midnight where you are well yeah

01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,640
we're about to finish up soon these

01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:05,440
streams usually only go for about an

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:09,360
hour and been gone for over an hour

01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:11,199
so yeah but basically that's all the ins

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,280
and outs of hacktoberfest how to get

01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:16,960
involved how to get started

01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,920
how to get your pull requests going

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,719
and yeah um i'm gonna open up a live

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,840
just a

01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:27,199
little bit to questions for just

01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:30,800

bit of

01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,360
um info on where to get started for

01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,760
october

01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,080
first especially as a new contributor

01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,080
yeah hopefully you can join for another

01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,120
stream so usually it's this time

01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:54,239
but on a friday um and also make sure

01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,520
you check out meetup group um

01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:01,920
so our virtual meetup group will have

01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:05,040
all the new um we'll have all the

01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,800
um streams so if you're keen

01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,400
to hear about the next one for before

01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,400
you run off icon

01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,760
so if you're keen you can come on to the

01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,320
next one

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,679
which is friday actually on a friday and

01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,840
we're talking about

01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,960
the command line because it's a little

01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,520
bit later though

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,960
um because we fit this one in for the

01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,239
maintainers timelines

01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,960
slightly different time than what we

01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:33,760
usually do um he's coming on to chat to

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,159
us about

01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,840
the github cli and all the open source

01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,360
nature that could help cli and how to

01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,640
contribute to the get off cli
