00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,119
home office set up

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
it's a fake one yeah yeah yeah but uh

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,520
yeah i had a chance to really settle in

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,759
and get myself a really good home office

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,720
that i had to destroy to move house but

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,720
um but

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,000
yeah and it meant that i was all ready

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
to go and had

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,920
some pretty good rules for myself around

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
working from home nice nice

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,120
well speaking of project content would

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
you like to

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,840
introduce project contour and maybe a

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
little bit about some of your

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
experiences and background as well

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
sure sure so project contour is an

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
ingress controller for kubernetes um

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
we uh that means that when you're

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
running your kubernetes clusters

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
we focus on bringing traffic into your

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,360
cluster to get to your services

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,560
um and there's a lot of different

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
controllers um

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
you know the one that most people think

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,319
of is the nginx have an ingress

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,680
controller that's kind of a default one

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,519
and project contour was built to

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
make some things about the ingress

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,400
experience a little easier particularly

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
when you're running services in pride

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
and

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
you know you want to have a cluster

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
that's shared by a bunch of people and

00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
you don't want it stopping all over each

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,920
other

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,800
um so we'll come back to that in a

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,640
minute though yeah

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,480
for me um i um although

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
although my name is young i'm actually

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
older than i look and i've been doing

uh and uh before working in contour i

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
was actually working for

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
atlassian's kubernetes team um

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,200
yeah yeah it was pretty cool um and uh

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,440
we had a real great opportunity to

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,680
build some cool tech there um and before

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,159
i came to work on some other cool techie

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,879

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,680
yeah yeah absolutely yeah and uh yeah we

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,360
got to use some

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
really cool kubernetes stuff very early

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
on in the lifetime of kubernetes so

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,159

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
i've

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,799
linked the github project contour link

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
as well

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,640
we'll get into a little bit more about

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,560
that too but um how did you get

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,280
involved in open source to start off

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
with nick before we jump more into

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
opening up project contour so um you

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,920
know i've been

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
i mean i've been using open source for a

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,400
long time i remember i think

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
the first time that i built um a proper

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,880
linux box was

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
in the late 90s um i built uh

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
i was working for like uh i was doing rt

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
consulting at the time and i was like

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,000
the it guy for a few small businesses

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,040
i came into this small business and they

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,479
had a um they had a windows ntbox

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
running a 9600 board modem that would

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,440
dial up to the internet

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
whenever someone asked for some internet

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
stuff and that was what was actually

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
serving their website

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,639
so if there was no one in the office for

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
long enough then their website would

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,800
actually go down

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,360
oh wow i built in this custom linux box

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
sorted them out with an isdn line had a

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
whole bunch of stuff running and all

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
this

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,759
stuff so that their website wouldn't go

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
down and then they can actually notice

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,639
this stuff

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
yeah yeah i've been doing yeah

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
definitely hashtag linux strongers or

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,360
someone's booking

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,080
it's great like um only yeah i look a

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
lot um

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
a lot younger than what i actually am um

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
so the opposite to you but

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,520
yeah definitely the days of dial-up and

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
just crazy i remember um

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
like i do a little twitch streaming as

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,560
well so one of my twitch streams were

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,560
chatting about dial up and i was like

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,600
let's go listen to the dial-up sound

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
just for some

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
good old days uh we pulled it up from

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
youtube i think it's got like

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,360
16 million views or something crazy on

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
that dial-up sound i was like

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
yeah good signer it's really terrifying

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,639
what's really terrifying is when you can

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
tell what speed the modem is connecting

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
at by the dial-up sound

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,240
yeah yeah i was the day i'm so glad we

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,160
don't have to deal with dial up anymore

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,800
could you imagine that in the pandemic

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,970
right now

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,970
[Music]

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,880
yeah when uh when we moved into this uh

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,840
our sort of temporary place while we're

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,639
renovating um

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,720
my kids have been at me like dad dad why

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
is there no wi-fi in our bedrooms like

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
dude so i just got to set up the extra

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
access point give me a little bit you

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
know

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,039
like where's our wi-fi yeah it was back

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,960
in the day it's like sorry you can't be

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
on the internet and the phone at the

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,000
same time like yeah

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
try telling the kids that like they just

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,479
i've tried to talk to them about that

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
before and they just give me this look

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,600
like

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,720
what but the thing is it wasn't that

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,520
long ago

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
oh i know don't realize but then there's

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
this whole generation of people

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
just grew up completely without internet

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
that's like yeah

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
well now pause for a moment while i make

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,600
the old man heals a cloud

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
position

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,319
[Music]

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
oh it's great well let's get into a

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,560
little bit more about project contour

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
so um i mentioned a little bit about

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,319
what it is but

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
how did it actually start the project it

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,440
actually

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
it actually was started by um by joe

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,800
bidder and

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
cheney um when that when they were both

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,080
at heptio

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,240
and so heftier was a big kubernetes

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,759
provider and the and so

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
some of their customers were finding

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
that uh using the kubernetes ingress

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
model

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
didn't work for production uses

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,039
sometimes because there's

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
there's a few ways with kubernetes

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,840
ingress where you can stomp all over

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
each other accidentally

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,560
i mean obviously when you're running a

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,479
real theme in production you really

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
don't want anybody to accidentally

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,319
be able to take keywords that's bad um

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,759
and so

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,759
uh yeah so that's where it came from is

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
that uh you know to sort of build our

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
own

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,639
ingress controller that would uh sort of

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
address some of the

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,599
the bigger scale issues that you have

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
with running kubernetes ingress when

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,680
it's not just

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
you know when you're not running

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
something but you're just sort of

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
kicking the tires off

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,599
yeah and so yeah from there um you know

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
the thing that we've that dave started

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,120
and that we that i've

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
tried to keep is that it's designed to

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,319
be a pretty tightly focused tool

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
you know it's designed to just to

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,080
ingress you know we don't

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,000
you know if you uh when we when we check

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,759
click around the website later in our

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
sort of philosophy document that i wrote

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,160
a little while ago

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
the first thing in there is contour is

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
not a service mesh so

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
you know because we use we actually

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,720
implement this using envoy which

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
lots of people use for service meshes

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
and so a lot of the time i'm sort of

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
saying yeah contour implements an

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
ingress controller using envoy and

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,639
people like

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,879
so it's a service mesh it's like no no

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,080
it's not

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
so that's why it's number one on the

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,759
list but so

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
um the sort of the basic idea is to take

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,159
a lot of the goodness that onward gives

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
you as a proxy

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,440
and enable you to use that to get your

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
traffic into your kubernetes clusters

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,760
and get them to

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
the services that you know the

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,479
application developers actually care

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
about product which is

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
the actual service that you're running

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,120
when you say please run my app inside

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
kubernetes

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,720
yeah well speaking around the website

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,399
let's go let's go click around so if we

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,760
look here this is your

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,560
um your product page on github um so

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,080
again i like to look at cool nice places

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,519
and people often say you know what's a

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,160
good example of a readme

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,600
this is a great example of a readme um

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,480
for an open source project

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
so um i'll move this this open source

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
variety out of the way someone can see

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,720
um but one of the things i'll say is you

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,040
know um good overview of the project

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
um how to get started because as an open

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,839
source project and we'll talk about this

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
and i'm gonna ask you some tips and

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,120
advice

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,640
for the audience um how to get started

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
how to contribute uh especially if

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,399
you're

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
like just learning here for the first

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,120
time a little bit about what it is and

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,360
then

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
um like a bunch of links and stuff but

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,279
this is almost like your landing page

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,760
um for a website so um i like it

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,600
very much yeah so um all right so where

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
would you like to start how about we

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,399
talk about

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,560
um right so say if i'm a um a maintainer

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,760
or i'm looking to get into open source

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
so i'm not maintaining a contributor i'm

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,200
looking to get into open source

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
if i landed here what would you be

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
wanting me to do and what would be your

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,200
tips

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,600
and tricks for me as a first time

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
contributor yeah so if you want to

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
if you feel like hey this contour thing

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,880
sounds pretty cool i'd be like a bit

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,279
chuffed to be honest but aside from that

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
yeah um the uh the thing that i that i

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,200
really like is

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
if you have a read of the document and

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
then down the bottom we've got the you

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
know the contributing section

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,519
yeah and so yo step one

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
read our code of conduct make sure you

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,240
very good go to code of conduct

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
yeah yeah um you know this is yeah this

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,720
is based on the cncf one it's a pretty

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
you know standard conduct basically it's

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,279
summed up in wheaton's rule you know

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
don't you dig

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,120
um and uh yeah yeah pretty much um

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
and uh but yeah then then after that we

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,920
have uh we have a couple of guides about

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,079
contributing yeah

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,440
contributing.md is the github center way

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
of doing it and so

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
yeah that's what we use on yeah we use

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
tco sign off which just

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
requires you sign your commits you know

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,399
but then you know we've got the

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,320
you know here's how you get this is your

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,120
first source here's how you build

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,480
all that sort of stuff um yeah and then

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
once it comes time to actually look for

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
something to do

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,959
once you've got the thing building and

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
you've tried it out um

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,320
yeah um well actually yeah one thing

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
that is important that uh that's in here

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
is

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
i tried to have i've sort of updated

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,040
this a couple of times since i started

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
i really wanted to have a good uh sort

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
of example of

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,079
what we were looking for like commit

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
messages oh yeah you got a commit

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
message template

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
yeah yeah so like you know he here's

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
what we're kind of looking for when it

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,640
comes to that so that we can

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
you know so we don't have to do a couple

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,800
of tries backwards and forwards more

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
projects need to do this

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,399
have a commit template but this is what

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
we talk about with a lot of our

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,079
travelers when we talk about like good

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,760
coding practices and like building good

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,160
culture around your

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
um your code in your project this is it

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
it's great

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,760
see one of one of the things that i

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,959
really wanted to put in there was that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
if you see you see in

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,800
the temple it's got like imperative mood

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,440
short description

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,279
so you know it's a bit of a wanky way to

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
put it but it's you know like the

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,959
the reason is that when you look at the

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
commit log if you have everything in the

00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,839
imperative mood

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
which is like you know as in the second

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,440
bit add book functions

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,880
rather than i did this or something like

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,760
that then when you read the commit log

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
it's clear

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,880
this commit does this and so that's why

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
that's why

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,399
it seems odd to be picky about the way

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,560
the sentence is written

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,320
but what it means is that later on when

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
someone's looking at the git log

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,519
it makes it much easier to read yeah

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
you're going through a whole lot you go

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,160
and see what happens

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,519
i went to a really good talk actually it

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,639
was the last irl conference i went to

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,320
um rubyconf and one of the um girls that

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
talked about documentation

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
and how basically documentation can

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,279
literally like your code can

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,000
live or die by documentation and she has

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,200
some really funny examples about like

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,800
how it can all go wrong um and this is

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,079
just this is great like and this is what

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
we talk about like you know this is the

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,760
reason why

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
we have the commit function and what you

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,760
don't just commit a

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,600
commit a piece of code or commit um a

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
new change you actually can comment on

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
it to make it meaningful

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
um yeah so yeah this is this is really

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
cool i like it

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
yeah yeah and so that's and that's why

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,320
we've got you know a little bit about

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
you know how we

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
how the how we the maintainers like

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
merge your pr's when you

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,480
we do squash and merge rather than

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
creating merge commits or anything like

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
that so that

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
again so that the commit history reads

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,320
better um and you know that sort of

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,639
stuff and then you know explains about

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,120
how

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,480
how the ci works and how you can run the

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
equivalent of the cia

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
locally a few other things like that i'm

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
actually yeah i mean

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
thanks for the praise you know i'm

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
actually been pretty proud of the

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
contributing documentation

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
this is yeah this is quite thorough i

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,680
would say as well so

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
like for example if i'm coming here for

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,360
the first time to commit

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,519
or to contribute i'd be like i know

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
exactly what is expected of me or what i

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,560
should do

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
um not only does it make it easier for

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
your project and you know the

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
maintainers to actually

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,360
understand what's happening what people

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,360
are doing as someone who is coming for

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,839
the first time i know exactly what to do

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,760
i don't have to be like go back and have

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,199
a look at what other people have done i

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,880
don't have to like

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,800
think about things too much and it's

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,399
much it's really easy to learn

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,399
um i think is like really key here um

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,160
but yeah so you've done some really cool

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,600
documentation here what other tips would

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
you have for um

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,760
people who are maintaining projects

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,279
apart from i guess

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,199
yeah i guess the biggest thing i can

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,440
give i can give is to just

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
you know every now and again you need to

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
stop what you're doing

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,199
go out and try and come back in being

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,560
like i know nothing about this thing

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,399
how would i get started and sort of

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,240
think to yourself like

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,160
what have i missed in what i do every

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
day about you know what should be in the

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,480
documentation

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
and actually the best time to do that is

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
when you get someone new come in to be a

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
maintainer

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
because a lot of the time they'll you

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,240
know especially

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,959
up until we got donated to the cncf

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,199
contour was

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,720
very much sponsored by vmware and so you

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,240
know we sometimes would have new people

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
come on from vmware and that was the

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
time when we could be like

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,560
hey check out all the documentation if

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
you

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,360
you know if there's anything we've

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
missed tell us and now's the time to fix

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,160
it because

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,519
you're a new person who is very strongly

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
invested in being able to contribute

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,360
here

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
can you please tell us all the bits that

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
we missed and that's one of the ways

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,399
that we've got this good is that

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,120
by taking the time when people start to

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,120
actually get

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
people to to help you know to get the

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,199
help yeah definitely

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,639
i think it's really good so if we have a

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
look at um

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
you know something we've been talking a

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,199
lot about um i'd get up with something

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,079
being started for money is

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
good first issues um so would you like

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,560
to talk us through some of the good

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,560
first issues for you and

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,160
maybe show us some examples yeah well we

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
have a we have a good first issue labels

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,360
so

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,040
if you uh head to the issues and go to

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,720
the labels and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,079
uh we've got a few there yep um so

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
importantly you know one of the one of

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,000
the things i thought was uh neat is that

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
um we open we pinned an issue a while

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
ago that's uh

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,079
how do you use contour oh yeah that's

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,720
cool

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,759
is that uh oh here we go up the top yeah

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,279
right there

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,680
sweet oh so what is this one

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,800
for you to give you ideas on how they

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,880
use contour

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
yeah yeah so so we can come and con

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,759
contact people if we

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
if we're doing something that affects

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
someone who uses contour in a specific

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
way

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,160
then we've got a github idea of someone

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
who we can be like you know hey you know

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,680
hey man like

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,120
you're a person yo how did you are you

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
still using it this way

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,320
if we're going to change this can you

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
check it out for me like

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,120
you know if i'm going to make a change

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,320
to this how would you feel about it that

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
we can mention people on issues and

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,680
stuff like that

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
and have you know and have people who

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,920
are concerned about a particular feature

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,360
give us feedback on how we build that

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,199
this would be really good as a

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,680
discussion thread

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,199
okay noted well i mean you might not

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,120
have it set up for your

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,759
project but if you would like to start

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,079
using discussions let us know and we can

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,560
sort something out there um but you have

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,560
you heard about github discussions yeah

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,600
um i i have seen i've seen them on a

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,519
couple of projects yeah

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
yeah so what you can do as well one of

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,360
the coolest things we set up for them is

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,360
you can convert an issue to a discussion

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,720
so when you can start use discussions

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
you can say oh this would be great as a

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
discussion let's

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,320
click convert um and the coolest thing

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
about discussions over issues is um

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,280
especially for things like this where

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,480
it's not really like a bug fix or

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,880
something specific

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,039
um you can have all the nested replies

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,600
um which makes stuff like this

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
can be a license that'd be cool all

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,480
right so we'll go back to um

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,799
yeah so let us know if you want to get

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
on that

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,840
i think it's issue singular good first

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,840
issue

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,440
doesn't want to come up let's go the

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,640
old-fashioned way

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
of labeling it like this filter by

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
labels

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,679
there we go

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
sometimes it's easy to do that yeah wow

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,400
we got lots of them

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,120
lost lots of good first yeah yeah yeah

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
totally

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
um yeah we also use the hell wanted one

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,039
for sometimes things are hell pondered

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,200
but not good first issue

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,760
because you know that's when that's when

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,039
it's like hey we know this is important

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
it kind of requires someone to have a

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,000
little bit of familiarity with the

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
project before you might try and do it

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
but at the same time maybe we might not

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,080
be able to maybe the call maintainers

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
might not be able to get to it for a

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
while

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,520
so that's what health wanted us for um

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
so

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
we've got a whole bunch of documentation

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
um things in here to be honest that's

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
probably the best place

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
if you really want to sort of get

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
started you know that's the best place

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
to get started usually on any project is

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,799
find some documentation bugs and fix

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,600
them um because if nothing else that

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
will get you

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,720
that will get your sort of pr loop

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
sorted out

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,919
um obviously we are a kubernetes

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
controller and uh

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
it's the same flow that in the

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
kubernetes

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,919
could you x people recommend is that you

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
know if you want to get started with

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,559
kubernetes one of the best things to do

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,760
is to go find the document the

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
documentation and

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,720
find a bug and fix that fix the

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,200
documentation button and you've also got

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
yours

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
tagged by documentation as well i can

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,520
see that which is kind of easy but say

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,080
again

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
i'm here nude i'll go oh okay well these

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
are good first issues

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,600
so for um lots of people the concept of

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
good first issues is and i'm sure you'll

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
always see the same ways

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
it's a good place if you're a first time

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,360
contributor correct

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
you go as a good first issue a good

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,200
place to start

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,880
for a project um yeah and you've done

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
even one step further by like tagging

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,919
them for

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,720
specific um areas if i'm not quite sure

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,200
where to start

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,960
i can go yeah i've got i've got some

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
skills and documentation i know how to

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
use certificates so let's have a look at

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
this

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,880
yeah exactly um we can go here and then

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,600
go oh sweet so

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,919
you need some help here yes exactly and

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,840
so

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,520
this is a good example where we've got

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,120
um you know we've got

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
currently a document that tells you how

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,160
you can use uh

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,200
the project ser manager um to generate

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,559
certificates for your

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,600
installs um for your services um that

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,880
that currently uses

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
uh a dummy ingress object to to kick off

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
the fl the

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,880
manager flow what this what this issue

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,880
is saying is hey

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
they have their own object type that you

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,600
can create that will also kick off the

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,520
flow and it means that you're not

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,559
creating dummy objects for no reason you

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,640
you're actually creating the object

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,480
you're supposed to create and so um

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,159
that's what then when steve looked at

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,520
you that's what he was saying and so

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
you know you can see here sort of said

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
hey we should do that and then if you

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,320
scroll down a little bit

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,960
one of my jobs as tech leaders to come

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
in and be like hey you know

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
i agree this current situation isn't

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,480
great

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,080
and you wrote that before covered yeah

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,559
exactly one of the key one of the key

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
things

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,919
that i found uh the key skills for being

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,600
a tech lead is uh

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,360
understatement yeah yeah

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,039
yeah so um you know and to so what i

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,880
wanted to do say with that coin is to

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,000
give people what i try and do with these

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,520
good first issues is to make sure

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
there's a bit of background in them

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,360
so people understand why why it is an

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
issue what we've done about it in the

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
past and why you want to do something

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,799
why you want to do something about it

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,840
and then if so like a kind of a

00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,400
checklist for things that you should

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
look at

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,799
um so that so that you're not just sort

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,000
of being like it's not like a one line

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,440
please do this and then you've got to

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,039
come to slack or something like that and

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,679
find out from us what you need to do

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,520
in my mind a good first issue issue

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,640
should have

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
enough information in there that you

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,000
should be able to work on it without

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,799
needing to come to us for any

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,320
extra information yep so when you open

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
up your good first issues

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
or your good issues you're good amazing

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,159
issues

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,440
um so steve is he part of his ea

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
yeah so is he a maintainer of the

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,679
project as well with you he is yes

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,039
yep awesome so he would open this and

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
then you would come in i can see that

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,520
basically the same date so you would

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
come in

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,600
and write your little piece yeah um then

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
steve would write back

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,880
so we've sort of backwards and forwarded

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
a bit here um so this was when dave was

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,760
still working with us

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
you know so we've all sort of talked a

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,240
little bit yeah we definitely need to do

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
something like this

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,840
and so on and so forth we agreed yeah

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,559
this is actually what we need to do

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,880
got closed by a mistake um you know the

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,640
usual sort of issue flow

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,640
and then at some point you know um at

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
some point we've added the good first

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
issue label which we're like yes

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,919
yep cool and so i was kind of sitting

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
there waiting for a would-be contributor

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,200
to come along and

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,440
contribute to it exactly yeah yeah so

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,760
that's why we live in that yeah

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
yeah so there's um there's a bunch of

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,440
there are some code

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,360
uh related issues as well um yeah most

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,919
of them tend to be ones where it's

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,960
a very small code patch that would need

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,880
to be submitted

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
but at the same time it's like not you

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,200
know it's actually one of those ones

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,120
where

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
it's a small code patch the feature the

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
functionality is not critical enough

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,799
that we absolutely need to get it in

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
right away

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
so we're actually specifically leaving

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
that there so that someone who wants to

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,919
do some coding

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,600
but doesn't know the project very well

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,799
has something to come in and do yeah um

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
you know a great example that if you

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,080
actually head to the pull requests

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,000
there is a pull request for enabling

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,360
strict yammer parsing in the config file

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,600
oh there's some parsian

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
yeah that's it see this was this is a

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
there is a

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,840
yep there is a uh yep there is a there

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,559
is an issue there two six two three

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,080
um you know and that was like you know

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,760
where we discussed

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
um you can see that if you click into

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
two six two three it's a good first

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,840
issue as well

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,640
um i like this flow yeah it's great

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,360
yep okay they're very good issue

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,120
deployment

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,480
powerpoint yes exactly yeah um and so

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,799
yeah this was one where

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
you know james peach is also one of the

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,880
maintainers and he sort of said hey when

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
i was

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
i was doing something with adding a new

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,240
feature and i found that

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,400
you know the conflict didn't work and i

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,000
couldn't figure out why and so

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
if we added in strict yammer parsing

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,159
then if we could add in a thing that

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,520
would make it more clear as to why

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,799
this particular value didn't work

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,679
because which is because the animal

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,360
didn't pass

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,480
yeah yeah so tim has come in and said

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
hey can i pick this up

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,720
so no problem he's generated a pr um and

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
i think we've had a round of review

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
already

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,520
um on the pr linked initially three days

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,200
ago yeah yep

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,279
and again this is where this is where

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
the commit uh the commit template comes

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
in because because we

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,799
strongly recommend to people that um

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,760
well actually one of the things that's

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,279
part of our

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,120
sort of project philosophy is that we

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,919
talk first and then code

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,640
so we i like math i like that yeah we

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,000
don't like to have it

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,000
we don't like to have a pr without an

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,559
issue yeah so

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,080
so that we've agreed that what we're

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,720
doing in the pr is actually what we want

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,640
to do

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,240
sometimes it's easy when you look at a

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,200
project you're like i need to solve just

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
my problem

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
yeah easy to make a pr that solves your

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
problem but as a maintainer sometimes

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,600
what i find is that

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
you that may actually create problems

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,120
for other people because

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,880
because you as the person who's fixing

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,360
your problem which is awesome

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,440
don't have the context around how to fix

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
it

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,559
i think it's like the trading equivalent

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,520
of uh measure twice cut once

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,320
exactly yeah yeah talk first thing code

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
is exactly that

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
yeah exactly remember that yeah that is

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,799
great

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,200
yeah so speaking of like um obviously

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
if you want to come to a project you

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
want to contribute for

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
the first time um one of the things you

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,720
probably really want to know

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,840
is um what languages do you code in yes

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
um so what is um contour written in um

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
it's

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,360
mostly go yeah mostly garland

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
mean if you look at the that nifty thing

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
you've got where it tells you the

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
percentage of

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
things there i think it's i think it's

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
uh pretty much almost all go with a

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,039
little bit of makefile

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
and there you go down the side and

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,520
and yeah because we store the source of

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,679
the site in there yeah so 67.8

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
is written in go so if you're a go

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,720
programmer

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,400
it's a good place to start it is totally

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,360
yeah yeah so i mean basically the entire

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
thing is written in go

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
we also have the websites stored in the

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
same repo so that's why we've also got

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,559
the the front end stuff

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
yeah there uh yeah and then we've got a

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,760
sprinkling of makefile and shell scripts

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,320
and stuff to actually do the building

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,240
nice this is another good spot for um

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,840
contributors to look at as well

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,600
and to go like for example if you're a

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
ruby programmer it's not going to be

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,880
useful

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,679
yeah but if you're obviously go you can

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
say i am

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
nearly like this whole thing's pretty

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,919
much written and go this is a really

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,919
good place to start so

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,400
absolutely yeah awesome um do you have

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,640
more questions um from the chat um oh

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
we've got one from pinkham who's i know

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
he's just started

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,559
learning a bunch of coding as well on

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,279
the one from from my chat

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,480
um i say what is what is the go language

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,679
you'd like to tell us a little bit more

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,120
about the go language

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,480
um so go is a compiled language

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,640
as opposed to python or something like

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,480
that which is a interpreted language

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
what that means is that in order to run

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,200
a go program you

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,120
compile the program into a winery that

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,919
you then run whereas with python you

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,240
will

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,919
take your code and run it directly by

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,320
the interpreter

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,840
the advantage of a compiled language

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,159
that is good in some situations

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
is that you can take that binary

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
especially in ghost case

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559
it's a statically linked binary

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
generally which means that you can pick

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,039
up that binary and copy it anywhere

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,799
and that buyer will work no without any

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,240
extra libraries or installs so

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
if you're used to python i did a lot of

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
programming python beforehand and i know

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,360
i used to spend a lot of time

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,799
thrashing around with virtual limbs and

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,159
stuff to make sure i had all the right

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,200
requirements the good thing about go is

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,039
that once you compile the thing and

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
built it you run that go binary anywhere

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,600
and it doesn't matter

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
you don't need all the build tools on

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,440
there to be able to run um

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
but the the advantages of the language

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,679
are it's uh um

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,200
it's a built it's a google it's a

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,480
language from google but it's built for

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
um

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
to be a sort of c like syntax so you've

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,360
got a lot of control over pointers and

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,679
stuff like that you don't

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,279
in more interpreted languages uh but

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,440
you've also got um

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,200
it's got type safety and it's got a lot

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,399
of support for concurrency so

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,679
it's kind of the de facto as much as i

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,760
might get the flag for saying this

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,120
it's kind of the de facto uh cloud

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
native language so if you're doing

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,960
anything

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,559
kubernetes or you know cloud native

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
most of the tools that are cloud native

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
at the moment and a part of cncf

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,200
are written in go yeah kubernetes is all

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,120
written and go so if you're doing

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,760
anything cube related probably you

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,799
you should be learning some go at least

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
even if you're not going to write in it

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,960
primarily

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,320
knowing a bit about it will help you

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,919
understand what's going on well i was

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,919
gonna be my next question so speaking of

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,320
learning if people want to learn go

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,640
or to brush up on their growth skills

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,120
where would you recommend they go to

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
um so there's a couple the the basic

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,399
there's a couple of great

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,440
online go tutorials and there's

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,360
basically a whole book

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
of learning go online that's available

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,679
for free online

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,440
um that is i'm absolutely amazing um

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,799
go also has the go playground which is

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,559
like a

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,480
website where you can enter go code and

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,520
run it in your browser

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,080
um and it is

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,279
yeah yes yeah it's really great um so

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
you can just hit run on that

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,919
and that will run that will run that

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
code for you and you'll get the result

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,000
kind of bottom right hello playground

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,919
it's behind me for anyone who can't say

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,360
that it says hello programmed

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,799
programmer exactly and so so you can do

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,720
anything that you can do in a normal go

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,159
programming program you can do there

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
it's off it's actually really useful a

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,520
lot of the time for if you need to talk

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,200
to someone about a code sample you can

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
put it in the playground and then people

00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
can edit it

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,200
as they wish and change it around and

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
stuff like that also a lot of

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,520
go tutorials will use the playground um

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,559
but yeah and uh

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,919
then i mean for me for me one of the

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
advantages of coming to work on contour

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
when i first started was that uh you

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,279
know

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
dave cheney is one of the big proponents

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,000
of going he's one of those people who's

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,320
written a lot of tutorials

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
so yeah instead of there's quite a few

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,880
times when i'd be like hey dave how

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,159
should i do this and he'd be like you

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,240
should do this i'm like

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,000
didn't you write a blog post where you

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,039
told me i should do something else

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,679
and you'd be like damn yeah i think i

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,000
mean

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
people kind of miss that point when

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,080
they're looking at um

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,679
open source and that's that like when

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,520
you're contributing open source

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,440
you get to learn from all these other

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
amazing developers around you so

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
um if you've just started go like going

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,000
to a place like project contour

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,919
obviously there's go developers there

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,320
because all written on go so it's such a

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,720
great way to learn from those around you

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,559
um like i'm assuming your skills and go

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,080
a lot better from

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,600
100 100 yeah yeah totally um yeah i mean

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,520
i would have said before i started on

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,399
project control i was go literate

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,240
but not fluent and now i'm i i would

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,919
feel i'm much closer to floor i can have

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
arguments with people about the right

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,679
the right ways to do that

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,320
arguments is that the standard isn't

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
that the bar

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,520
so if i could have an argument with

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,120
someone about this then

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,520
if you can have if you can have a strong

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,200
uh opinionated discussion with somebody

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
about some tiny little feature of the

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,240
language and the best way to use it

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,760
then that says to me that you're really

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
familiar with the language oh my gosh i

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,640
wonder if anyone in the chat has had any

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,320
experience like that if you have

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
let us know i would like to share it you

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,200
know it's hilarious when you get to that

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,640
stage um

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,399
i know um they say similar if you start

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
dreaming in the language that you're

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,320
learning so whether it's a

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,760
spoken language or a programming written

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,520
like once you start dreaming about it

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,200
then you know you're going nuts or that

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,240
you're really fluent in it

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,720
totally eternally yeah yeah yeah so

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
yeah i was going to say yeah it's like

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
when i was writing a lot of python like

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,000
you know you'd have i'd have a lot of

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,360
uh vigorous discussions with people

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
about the you know the right time and

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,320
place to use various types of

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
comprehension whether that be list

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
comprehension or dictionary

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
comprehensions or whatever

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,760
um yeah that's when you know you're you

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,360
know you're doing the you're doing the

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,440
language for reals when you

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,799
start having you know but we really

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,519
should do this because it's the better

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,840
way to do it

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,440
yeah i think it's like that's one thing

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,240
i like about programming though is that

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,880
there's

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,320
multiple ways of doing one thing yeah

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,760
and you need to choose

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,919
the thing that works best for your

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,360
scenario i think that's what i really

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,440
like about like if you give

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,399
um you know 10 developers the same

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,320
problem

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,039
uh or the same like you know build this

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,799
function that does this this this like

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,480
some of them will be similar but some

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,320
people use like you know

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,399
a loop and other people use like you

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,519
know other things and like i'm just like

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,720
i just started doing some more

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,720
programming again

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,799
um i do it often live and some people

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
are going now you should totally use

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,720
like a switch here instead of

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,200
an if statement and i'm just like and

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,519
then people start arguing in my chat

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,200
and i'm just like i just gotta sit there

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,799
god this is cool i'm just gonna let you

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
all argue i just like

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,240
yeah we'll just see what happens yeah

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,799
totally this is

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,320
as i said vigorous discussion oh yeah

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,880
yeah you should see what happens when

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,720
there's

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,039
you know a screen in front of people or

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,640
just like throwing all things in

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,720
um but yeah the next thing i wanted to

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,279
talk a little bit about is um

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,159
more about like what you end up doing on

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,240
github and

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,640
other projects that you might contribute

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,000
to so other other projects apart from

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,399
contour that you

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
um you might like drop in on contribute

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,000
to or

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,279
maybe even some that are dependent um i

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,120
have interdependencies on

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,640
project contour um so well most of

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,120
contour is kind of pretty high up the

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,399
stack so most of we depend on things

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,880
more than people depend on us

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,080
at the moment but you know we depend on

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,279
kubernetes

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,799
and we depend on we use prometheus

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,360
metrics so we depend on the prometheus

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,799
libraries

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,039
um and also we use envoy um

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,799
and so all three of those things are

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,360
open source in our github

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,559
uh so i mean obviously kubernetes is

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,080
like

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,679
you know people talk about the 800 pound

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,760
gorillas kubernetes is like an army of

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,360
800 pound

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,919
in terms of the amount of code and the

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,320
sheer volume of people working

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,039
so it's probably if you've never done

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,760
open source

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,279
contribution before you i mean although

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,640
there's a whole group dedicated to

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,880
making your life easier

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,240
as a new contributor but even so it can

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
be very intimidating um

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,120
you know because there's a lot of people

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,159
and a lot of people have been doing it

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,960
for a long time and

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,320
there's a lot of stuff going on um but

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,360
yeah um and so

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,960
one of the things that kubernetes does

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
about that is kubernetes breaks down the

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,519
project into special

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,039
interest groups or seats and so i'm

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,919
involved in a couple of sigs

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,159
and a working group um so i'm involved

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
in the seek network some project called

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
the service apis which is um it's

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,279
actually an alpha of what we do in

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,360
contour and

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,960
the ingress ingress is how you get

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,360
traffic into a kubernetes cluster

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,200
the service apis is a is an attempt to

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,840
build a new version of that that

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
that takes a lot of what you know people

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
like

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,839
arsenal contour have learned by trying

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,480
to build things that do that and build

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,480
like a new version

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
so that's a pretty ongoing project

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,159
there's a lot of big

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,440
uh you know big companies really backing

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,879
it which is really cool

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,839
you know go google red hat um vmware

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,359
which is where i work

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,879
um you know a bunch of other companies

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,240
are like really very heavily invested in

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,960
there so it's really interesting one to

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,159
watch

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,879
yeah um yeah in terms of and then

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,280
in terms of small stuff um you know i

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,760
guess

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,679
i've sort of tried it i've helped on a

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,159
bunch of other stuff um

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,200
i contributed a little tiny bit to etd

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,240
and a couple of other things which are

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,399
also ones that

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,359
uh kubernetes use um i'll be honest

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,720
though most of my

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,960
most of my contributions have been for

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,960
work rather than for fun

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,879
nothing wrong with that i was going to

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,160
ask about that like because

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,440
you know project contour obviously

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
relies on some of these other big

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,040
projects

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,400
do you ever encourage um like your

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,160
contributors to say

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,200
oh like hey we actually depend on this

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,079
product if there's ever anything you

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,599
want to do

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,960
go and contribute to make sure it's i

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,400
mean obviously kubernetes is not going

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,480
anywhere anytime soon

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
um but do you ever do that yeah

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,000
absolutely like i'll

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,760
a lot of the time we'll say hey is this

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,280
better for us to build or is it better

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,839
for some for us to

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
you know go and build it in the upstream

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,119
in the upstream project instead

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
yeah yeah how do you decide

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,560
kind that a case it's kind of a

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,480
case-by-case thing um so we're actually

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,000
working on at the moment um

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,000
the envoy project have a go control

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,839
plane because envoy itself is written in

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,880
c plus plus rather than go

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,960
uh and so interacting with envoy users

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,040
um they have their own set of apis

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,560
and they have a special um they have a

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,119
control plane library called go control

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,320
plane

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,000
that lets you write go programs that

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,040
interact with their apis in a more easy

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
way

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,880
we contour actually predates that so

00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,680
we've got our own code that does the

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
same thing

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,119
and so we've been sort of looking at

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,200
trying to move our code to use

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,480
the control plane and some of the stuff

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,839
that we do is a little bit different to

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,160
the way that the go control plane does

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,119
it

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,800
some of the stuff they do has been

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,079
different to us and so we've been sort

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,119
of talking about

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,440
which bits we would build ourselves and

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,880
if we move to it like what functionality

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,960
we can add back to the

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,240
control plane so that everyone gets it

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,160
um because

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,160
you know a lot of the time it's and

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,280
there's there's a there's a there's two

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,560
reasons there one

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,400
is being a good citizen right like

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,160
contributing upstream when you

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,520
take stuff from everybody else is just

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,359
being nice but

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,800
but also there's actually a selfish

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,960
motive as well which is that

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,240
when you contribute upstream that means

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,000
that other people are going to take

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,520
their code and they can fix it for you

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,599
if it doesn't do what they want as well

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,599
yeah so it's not just you working on it

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,880
then it's everybody working on it

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,280
yeah exactly and that's one of the

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,760
biggest like you know reasons for open

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,079
source i

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
was really interested actually i was um

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,280
i was working on blender the other day

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,480
so i was doing some stuff in blender on

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,079
my own twitch channel

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,440
and someone came like oh blender's so

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,800
good i'm like yeah i know blender's open

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,520
source is what i love about so much

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,320
they're like

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,680
i hate open source and i was like what

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,880
do you mean you hate open source because

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,240
i don't like they

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
found out they worked at github and they

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,320
didn't they didn't hate github i didn't

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,720
hate blender they hated the concept

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
of open source and i was like why do you

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,119
hate the concept of open source like oh

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,079
they just felt like it was companies

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,599
being lazy

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,680
and therefore open sourcing their stuff

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,520
so other people can fix it

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,599
i was like oh my gosh that's so

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,560
completely the opposite of what open

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,920
source is

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,680
you know it's all the things that you're

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,000
talking about right which is

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,880
you know people working on projects

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
together building

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,560
stuff that is you know better for other

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,079
people you know making this

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,000
um available because if you build

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,240
something upstream not only can

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
as you mentioned can they fix it but it

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,200
means that they can change it

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,520
and modify it for their needs as well so

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,400
more people get to use it for more cool

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,480
stuff

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,000
oh there's something you can get in the

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,119
chat's doing the whole facebook

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,480
it's just like i know right like it's

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,720
i just yeah yeah that

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,599
sounds very weird like it was really

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,680
weird i'm like

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,280
they must have had some bad experience

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,440
with open source or just

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,800
had a very misunderstanding of what it

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,000
actually is

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,520
um yeah it was very weird

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
absolutely yeah yeah i mean i think

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
there are absolutely times when people

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,079
companies do do that though they'll be

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,240
like hey this thing is open source

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,920
but by the way you you we won't accept

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,599
your pr's even if you raise them or you

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,760
know something like that like that

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,040
yeah it does happen you know but the

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,160
thing about open source is that people

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,720
learn that pretty quickly

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,599
and you know and everyone will hear

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,520
about the

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,119
the project that's doing that yeah

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,119
exactly i mean we've got like what over

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,760
50 million developers on the platform

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,320
over 100 and something million projects

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,160
you know

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,079
not every single one of them is going to

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,960
have be amazing right

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,400
like again it's just projects are run by

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
people and people sometimes have

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,280
different ideas so they must just have

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
had someone with a

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,400
you know an interesting idea that came

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,480
in was just like yeah well we're just

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
gonna resolve so everyone can fix it

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,599
and yeah no one actually from the

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,160
company anyone maintains it that's why i

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,640
think

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,320
um you know projects like yours or

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,440
blender or any of those kind of ones

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,200
that have got like

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,560
people dedicated to the project as well

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,920
as other people contributing just

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,960
ensures that they're

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,240
sustainable um absolutely yeah i mean i

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,839
think and i think the rise of the

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,520
foundations like the cncf and something

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,560
really helpful definitely

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,240
because when as a if you're a company

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,160
that's using the open source it gives

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,400
you that much more confidence that it's

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
it's not just some other company that is

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
making an open source out of the

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,920
goodness of their heart like

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,680
it's actually been donated out to a

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,880
foundation that's job it is to make sure

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,640
that the thing is

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,040
open source and is done in the right way

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,280
yeah exactly so speaking of that what

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,680
what are your thoughts around um github

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,880
sponsors

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,720
uh by which you mean you can have

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,440
sponsors where um people can

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,960
basically donate money to projects

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,599
that's a hundred that's a great idea

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,800
yeah it's

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,079
an amazing idea yeah sorry no no that's

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,839
fine yeah and i think

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,079
one of my favorite things about it is

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,319
like you know we talk about this a lot

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,319
right the ethics of open source and what

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,119
obviously what ethical things about open

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,960
sources

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,880
you know if you use a project you know

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,160
try and contribute back to it

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,680
um but as you know not everyone can

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,359
either they might not have the skills to

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,040
do it all the time i have the time

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,640
either so i think opening up

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,680
to um for money as well is such a great

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,200
way to be like

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,000
oh look you don't have time or skills

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,839
you can just give us money instead

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,119
i mean money can be changed into time

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,319
more skills

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,400
reasonably in a reasonably

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,000
straightforward fashion so yeah yeah

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,839
have you considered um if project

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,480
contour will be on the github sponsors

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,480
list or

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,079
so yeah maybe maybe maybe but

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
i mean i think the fact that we're kind

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,359
of heavily sponsored by a

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,359
biob company is vmware

00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,920
yeah i keep forgetting that you're like

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,119
backed by a bigger

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,040
um project as well um which again

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,960
is another great way to do open source

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,920
and i love the fact that big companies

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,920
do that

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,440
um now if we look at for example

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,720
microsoft biggest contributor open

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,359
source in the world

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,839
um you know all of their stuff facebook

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,160
google

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,960
i just think it's great that these you

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,119
know

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,560
companies can do that yeah yes i mean

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,079
we've actually only recently been

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,599
donated to this ncf

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,359
uh that was only in sort of the last

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,560
month or so that actually all finally

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,119
went through and we got

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,079
officially donated so oh cool that's

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,480
probably why i missed it because it's

00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,079
only been a couple months so yeah

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,760
yeah yeah so it's really exciting

00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,319
because yeah now that now that means

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,520
that

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,599
you know i mean although i work for

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
vmware like the project that i work on

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,560
like you know it means that all of the

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,800
ip and all of the official

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,560
stuff has been handed over to the cncf

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,319
and and now

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,839
even if the worst should happen which it

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,119
never will as far as i'm concerned

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,280
but like if vmware should change their

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,240
mind and say and pull me off the

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,880
project then the project the source code

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,960
stays

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,960
with them exactly yeah yeah and

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,440
yeah exactly but you know it's always

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,240
good to have that you know the ducks in

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,680
a row just

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,880
in case yeah for sure as i was saying a

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,000
couple people i do a lot of startup

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,160
mentoring as well

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,920
um having those types of things in place

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,599
doesn't necessarily mean like hey this

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
is here in case the thing goes wrong

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,960
which it hopefully never will

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,240
it just shows that people actually have

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,640
more trust

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,400
um it's a it's a very weird double-edged

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,640
sword by having those things in place it

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,599
shows more trust but also it shows that

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,240
um everyone knows what you're doing um

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,720
there's

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,520
super transparent and nothing can go

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,920
wrong

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,599
um even if you know the very very tiny

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,000
miniscule chance that it could it just i

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,920
just

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,079
feel like it just shows up you know that

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,880
high level of trust and knowledge

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,160
um it shows that you thought about the

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,040
fact that things could go wrong

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,440
yeah exactly and they value that more

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
yeah

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,839
it's the open source version of buying

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,520
insurance right like yeah

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,200
exactly i like i'm gonna use that one uh

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,720
doing this is the open source version of

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,720
buying insurance

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,240
i've picked up a few good quotes in our

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,440
open source fridays every time someone

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,200
says cool i'm like

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,079
cool someone clip it that's that's

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,880
nick's quote for the you know

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,560
um yeah so um as well as a couple more

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,319
things before we've got about

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,680
10 minutes left so if anyone has more

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,160
questions please put them in the chat i

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
know

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,640
it's a little bit lighter on today um

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,400
not being on the american time zone

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,319
we often have a little less but um thank

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,760
you everyone for being here so far

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,160
um but one thing i did want to chat

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,400
about is um

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,599
well github profile i know she haven't

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,319
done yours up yet

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,920
are you considering i 100 will do the

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,119
github profile yes i'm looking forward

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,440
to writing my readme yeah

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,280
oh awesome that's cool um the other one

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,760
i want to ask you about is we often ask

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,400
people

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
um what are the latest the top all the

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,640
top

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,960
they're not the top three but the last

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,760
three projects you starred

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,400
um on github that's a good question you

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,560
can actually go and check if you need to

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,560
probably it's been a little while

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
so uh i think i can even check yeah

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,839
check i'm young i'm a young nick on

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,720
github and i'm young

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,359
i was like can i check your stars yeah

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,480
there we go there's your stars so

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:22,000
fedora yeah yeah so

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,720
that was uh yeah so fedora fedora mate

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
uh red hat

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,240
we make linux they're making flavor of

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,440
linux and then um yeah they

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,359
um they are building uh they bought

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,839
coreos a while ago and so this is their

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,640
tracker for that yeah so yeah you can

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,800
see that

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,560
the second one is i actually use uh home

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,800
assistant which is a open source home

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,480
automation tool oh smartphone

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,079
yeah yeah and uh yeah so that was

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,720
there's a conflict library where people

00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,640
can

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,400
pay our confidence nice this is what we

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,079
do we check like what your last styles

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,920
were and why so obviously yeah the

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,240
vmware one that kind of makes sense

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,599
movie store guy what's this one war

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,839
games

00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,920
oh i don't even i just don't even know

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,240
why

00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,720
i was like are you a gamer yes i am a

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,839

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,280
you play

00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,599
uh so uh destiny 2 is my poison um yeah

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
nice but uh yeah i i play a lot of

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,920
things but yeah

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,599
destiny 2 is the one that sucks up most

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,560
of my time because i've got a young

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,839
family i uh

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,839
there's only so much that's uh the

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,400
gaming time i get just

um it's almost it's on my to playlist

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,119
it is a gorgeous game yeah absolutely

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,880
gorgeous

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,560
like there's been quite a few times

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,440
where i saw it you know i

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,760
you know i've been playing games for a

00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,880
long time and uh yeah but it's one of

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,319
the few games where i sort of stop and

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
be like

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,319
yeah i think that's the thing like i

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,119
want to get it for the graphics like it

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,160
looks

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,440
beautiful and i think it was the top the

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,480
fastest selling

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,359
like non-big studio game for like or

00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,079
independent game

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,319
in like ages i guess i sold some

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,800
ridiculous number of copies

00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,760
in the first light week or so i'm just

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,240
reading um

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,839
pw's comment says he always um

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,720
pronounces court os

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,720
like oreos

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,839
fun fact oreo is actually vegan for

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,040
anyone who um didn't know the oreos

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,319
weren't vegan so

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,400
i did not know that that is very

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,319
interesting they use um coconut oil

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,400
instead of like milk powder or milk

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,800
and so i'm also gluten free so i can't

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,760
even have them because they're still

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,640
vegan but they're filled with gluten

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,480
dang

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
yeah so yeah pink hammer hasn't got um

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,400
ghosts of sashimi yet but i'm probably

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,440

the ancient greek one which i did that

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,599
as well

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,559

oh black flag that was that is a great

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,240
game i learned so many pirate shinies

00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,760
from playing that game all these

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,119
dudes you gotta collect all the shadies

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,480
i played black flag as well it was

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,280
really interesting i played it with a

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,319
friend

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,760
and i just did not like the um

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,599
the like the ship stuff

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,200
i just didn't like sailing around i mean

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,160
i like the sailing right the whole ship

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,079
battles and things

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,839
is in like i like that like the ground

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
combat um and it was really interesting

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,559
because my mate who i was playing with

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,760
he liked the opposite he liked the ship

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,079
stuff not the ground so

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,400
we were just playing yeah it's your turn

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,079
just keyboard and mouse over there and

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
you go do the ship then oh it's back to

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,960
lan all right your turn bish

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,760
that's great yeah the shanties they're

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,520
great

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
it is it is i agree with picking that it

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,319
is an excellent pirate game

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,720
you know really really fun buyer game

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,160
well have you played sea of thieves then

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,839
i i played a little bit when it first

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,160
came out but um

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,599
yeah i've only got room for one sort of

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,839
grinding online service game

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,000
and that was destiny so see if they've

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,440
lost out to destiny for me

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,119
although it's a great game it is a great

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,000
game absolutely but uh

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,839
yeah it just uh yeah like i said there's

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,160
only there was only room for one

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,400
yeah yeah i know that's the problem like

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,520

when you buy a new game but then like

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,720

for um people wanting to either get into

open source or people wanting to either

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,400
i've got people asking how do i start an

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,200
open source project

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,160
or just top tips and maintainers as well

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,400
um so

00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,200
i mean yeah so in terms of starting the

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,559
best thing to do

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,319
for starting an open source project is

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,520
just to start it um

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,440
you can sit around thinking about how

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,960
you'd like to do it all day just start

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,640
it probably should repo like it doesn't

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,880
matter if it's not perfect

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,400
you know let's be real like until you

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,119
get like more than 10 users

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,280
like you're like you know your project

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,880
will vanish into github until

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,400
until until you have that into the black

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,800
hole that is github

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,160
yes absolutely yeah and then yeah until

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,280
you until you actually establish a

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,000
critical mass of people using your

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,319
project

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,280
you can do whatever you like really like

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,839
you know and

00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,280
um i guess in terms of starting to

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,920
contribute to something the best way to

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,359
start

00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,839
something is do the stuff we talked

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,200
about today contributing guide

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,720
look at the good first issues find

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,119
something you actually want to fix fix

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,839
it up

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,200
like speaking as a maintainer nothing

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:48,960
makes me more happy

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,559
that when someone shows up and says

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,599
please could i fix this issue you will

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,800
never hear me

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,040
oh my gosh yes if you're gonna say no

00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,000
say no don't touch that say well why

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,240
would you publish the thing anyway

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,280
exactly exactly yeah like as a

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,400
maintainer there's nothing that makes

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,319
you happier even if

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,000
you know i mean practically a lot of

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,599
those good first issues any one of us

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,880
maintainers could do them in like

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,240
half an hour an hour right like the

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,359
reason we leave them there is because we

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,960
want people to come

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,359
and do those things and learn how to do

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,720
things so eventually maybe someone might

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,400
want to climb the ladder and become a

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,599
regular contributor and then

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,119
you know like contour is looking for

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,480
maintainers like all of our maintenance

00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,359
currently works vmware we won't make it

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,400
so that we don't have

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,480
ones or not so we have we have a

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,160
contribution ladder published like you

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,839
know absolutely for any open source

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,240
project i guarantee you

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,839
if you show up and you do some work and

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,520
then you come back and you show up again

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,160
and you do more work

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,359
you will end up being one day if you

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,720
keep doing that you will end up as a

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,079
maintainer of that open source project

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,440
almost sir

00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,200
if you just keep showing up and doing

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,960
the work you will

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,119
you will be an important part of that

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,720
community because that is the number one

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,760
criteria of being part of the community

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,680
is showing up

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,599
i think so i think um you know pink ham

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,119
put in the chapter like it sounds like

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,640
i mean it's the same you do anything or

00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,680
people say well how do i start a company

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,240
how do i start

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,079
streaming how do i start you know

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,200
learning your code it's like

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,400
just start yeah explain it and do it

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,079
just do it if you can't change your mind

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,880
later it doesn't matter like yeah you

00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,200
know you

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,480
having started something once makes it

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,920
easier to start the nesting

00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,880
yeah exactly that yeah like

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,920
yeah if you're gonna if you want to do

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,920
content creation you want to be a

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,160
youtuber the only way to do that is to

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,040
make videos like put them on youtube

00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,319
like yeah

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,160
sure they'll probably be crap to start

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:33,839
with everyone does that like yeah

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,680
you know like but then one day you'll

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,760
find the thing that makes you

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,800
an interesting voice and people yeah or

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,400
people go i can't

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,440
start whether it's coding or um

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,599
content creation um people

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,480
i can't stop because i'm not good enough

00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,680
and i'm like

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,760
whether you are coding or you know

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,200
starting as you know streaming or videos

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
or whatever if you

00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,880
wait till you're good enough people are

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,400
going to be like this guy looks really

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,200
good why hasn't he got his giant

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,760
audience

00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,359
um i'm going to leave because i just

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,119
think they just assume that you

00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,559
have been around for ages and you just

00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,559
don't have any followers

00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,160
because your your stuff looks so

00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,880
polished whereas if you come into the

00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,119
start people

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,240
grow with you they learn with you they

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,880
feel like they're part of a community

00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,559
with you

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,760
uh whether you're doing content creation

00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,559
like streaming whether you're being a

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,920
developer

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,720
people are there to help you learn and

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,599
grow um so again if you come in and say

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,040
i'm a newbie um to go can you help me

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,359
people are gonna be really happy to help

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,160
you

00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,160
because if you come in as like a i'm i

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,599
know everything about go i spent five

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,040
years letting go just so i could

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,240
contribute to this project people are

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,359
gonna be like

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,680
okay sure like

00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,520
yeah but also you might probably you're

00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,640
not gonna be in the frame of mind of

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,960
wanting to learn and wanting to like get

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,680
involved in the community so as bdoggy

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,680
said this

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,520
the answer you've given nick is just so

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,720
inspiring and a lot of people are just

00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,280
getting there going

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,160
yes yeah all you do is hit that go

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,520
button

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,520
yeah that's that's i mean that's the key

00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,920
that's the key to doing anything is to

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,760
you know is to actually start like it's

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
easy to dream about doing things

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,359
but like top tip number one for actually

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,680
doing things is that just

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,559
do them like yeah and accept that to

00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,240
start with yeah

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,079
your stuff might not be might not be as

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,640
good as the people who you admire that's

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,240
fine

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,839
like people who you were admire were

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,119
beginners one day too like

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,440
yeah and and if you make something like

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,200
and you you show it to the people of

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,559
mine and be like hey i really admire you

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,319
and you inspired me to do this

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,160
i guarantee that you will make their day

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,920
oh totally i think two

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,920
doesn't guarantee it yeah definitely i

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,400
think too if you come in as a newbie

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,680
people give you a lot more leeway in

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,040
terms of like

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,640
messing up um and again like the person

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,000
who spends five years letting go to come

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,440
in you're not gonna give him any leeway

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,200
like you should know this stuff bro you

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,880
said you've been coding for like

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,720
five years just to learn this whereas if

00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,040
you're like yoni it's like oh hey

00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,960
you know try and give this a go or do

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,480
this and get a bit more hand holding

00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,400
again whether it's programming or

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,760
whether it's content creation

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,280
whether it's you know the maintainers or

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,559
contributors that you're working with or

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,520
whether it's an audience that you're

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,119
trying to talk to

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,440
people give you a lot more leeway when

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,040
you're starting out so

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,280
yeah so i think yeah definitely like you

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,920
said just get in there and stop

00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,440
it's okay and i mean as i think i said

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,400
to you earlier when we were when we were

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,240
getting ready though

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,520
you know i mean uh wheaton's rule always

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,000
applies right like

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,280
you know i mean and what other people

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,960
called in the past the golden rule like

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,520
you know treat the people who you

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,480
respect

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,839
the way that you would want to be

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,200
treated when you're and you were

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,880
respected right like

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,319
you know hey if you're new and you want

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,119
to show someone something cool that you

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,160
think you built

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,599
like go to them and take it to them and

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,720
be like hey check out this cool thing if

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,000
they don't respond they're probably just

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,200
busy it's not that they hate you right

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,480
yeah exactly

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,960
yeah i think you know like you

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,400
just remember that the other person on

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,880
the other side is like you and is a

00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,799
person

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,079
and look after them as much as you would

00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,559
want them to look after you

00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,680
and i think people forget that at the

00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,839
moment like in

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,280
today's day and age like they forget

00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,640
that on the other end

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,720
the thing or the person they're trying

00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,799
to get into is just a person

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,960
they have you know they have feelings

00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:12,079
and emotions and they get excited about

00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,680
stuff and you know

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,880
things like that so you know just

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,760
thinking about like on the other end of

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,680
that

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,280
that idol or someone you're trying to

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,119
get in touch with they're a person doing

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,880
you can connect on a personal level

00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,559
um so i think that's really important i

00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,119
love that idea of like

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,640
you know if somebody inspired you like

00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,200
send a message

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,640
or say like hey you are the one that got

00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,520
me into

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,280
this or you inspired me to learn go or

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,839
you inspired me to contribute to this

00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,160
project

00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,280
like yeah it totally makes people's day

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,720
yeah i mean but

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,319
i'd say the coral area to that that goes

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,680
with the second thing that i said is the

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,880
thing that i always try to do when i do

00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,480
that sort of stuff and i still do it

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,359
right yeah yeah like i said

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,880
my name may be young but i'm not um but

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,960
that doesn't mean that you know like i i

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,880
often will i make a big effort actually

00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,240
to if someone inspires me to send them

00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,520
things saying hey thanks for that that

00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,760
was really great i really

00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,200
it was really inspiring but at the same

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,680
time i don't expect you to reply i just

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,520
want you to read this sometime

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,119
i don't it doesn't matter to me if you

00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,480
reply right

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,440
and to say that to someone is important

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,559
because it takes the pressure off them

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,880
that they have to read the thing and be

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,480
like

00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,760
