00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,800
about that

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,840
you know fun fact about the road

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,759
microphone do you know that's an

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
australian company

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
yes i don't know it's so good i was like

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
yes i've been using rode for

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,160
quite some time uh quite a few years

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,320
yeah i know so cool right

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
and we've got uh lethal errors in the

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
chat saying

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
how much do you guys make with open

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
source tech well that might be a good

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,080
topic of conversation to get to later um

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
you know why people do open source how

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,960
much money you could potentially make

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,479
um as far as that question like how much

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
do you make in open source is the

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,479
basically equivalent of like

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,160
asking how much can you make on youtube

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,800
or how much can you make as a twitch

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
streamer

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
you can make everything from zero

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
dollars to whatever ninja's making which

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,240
is i think like 700

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,240
thousand u.s per month just in sub so

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
you know it really depends on what

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
you're doing right

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,039
yeah and i would say like most of those

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,639
twitch streamers they always respond

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,360
back with like just do it for

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
the fun and then that will pay the pay

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,240
to bills

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
eventually but it's a long tail i think

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
open source might be a little bit

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,520
similar we do have things like get up

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
sponsors

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
and uh you know patreon and open um

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
where's the open collective

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,240
uh i just forgot the other one but um

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
yeah there's quite a few other tools to

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
be able to make money through open

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
source but it really just comes down

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
with

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,199
your skill set exactly i think that's

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
right like you know people

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,800
a lot of people started off for fun i

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,160
mean we know some people especially some

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
people have got up to

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
six figures on their open source

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
projects we know some people like that

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
they

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
they started for fun they end up going

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,319
bigger and better so

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
uh oh oh my gosh i love your pizza emote

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,680

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,199
it's so good well i think what everyone

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,160
is here today today is to get into

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,600
how to actually make a github bot for

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,000
the twitch channel how to integrate

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
github

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
and twitch so i think we should get

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
started right

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
yeah yeah um this is one of my favorite

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
things to do i probably spend way too

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,680
much time

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,880
messing around with the with twitch

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,919
stuff and apis so i'm happy to share my

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,520
knowledge today

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
sounds good and before we do jump into

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
it we've got a question from dave call

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
which is are we both working for github

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
and apac

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,319
uh we both do work for github i work in

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,160
apex i'm located in melbourne australia

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
and b dougie

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
yeah i am normally based in san

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
francisco california but

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
at the moment uh for the next couple

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,400
months i'll be in florida which is where

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,400
i'm at right now a lot of people

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,840
have asked me on twitter why my

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
background so different

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
that is not a green screen this is

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,160
actually a blank room with one light

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a black rumor well you need to like set

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,080
up some sort of github swaggage or

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
something in the background there right

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
yeah you know i almost brought some

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
posters that i have been i've had

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
like sitting next to my desk and they

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
just didn't fit my suitcase they were

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,360
just slightly too long

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,280
and then the github shop uh refreshed so

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,039
there's no posters there so

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,960
i'm sort of out of github swag at the

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,680
moment all i have is a hoodie

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
um but i do have a coupon uh to buy some

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
stuff

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
in this github shop so maybe i'll there

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
you go maybe just like buy a few

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
t-shirts and like pin them on the wall

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,879
the background but i'm gonna say you

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,400
have like a printing store don't you you

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,479
have something there's just go and print

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
a couple out

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,240
yeah and uh someone's commenting on your

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
your esports though i know

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
do people like it i actually helped

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
design these

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,199
so these are these are very limited

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
edition we did them for some of the um

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
live coders which are bdog you know i

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
both happen to be involved

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
in the live coders live coding twitch

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,800
team which is exciting

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,680
and a couple of um our github people

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
have it as well

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
so um yeah thank you i'm glad you like

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,959
it was like the esports look that we

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
kind of went for

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,919
and i'm also loving um lethal errors

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,360
comment which is api is a person in need

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,600
we know that's not what it actually

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
stands for but let's jump into it

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,880
i know bw spent quite a bit of time

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,080
building

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,560
this um what do you call it

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
twitch bot thingy integration stuff

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
readme file looks all pretty i've

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
linked it in the chat would you like to

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
talk us through a little bit about this

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,480
first speedo before we jump into

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,839
actually doing the building

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,000
yeah yeah so um yeah so api meaning

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,560
application protocol interfaces uh it's

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,040
a way so you can basically connect to

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,720
different tools like twitch or github um

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,080
i guess zooming out a bit if you

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,519
haven't actually seen me i know there's

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
a lot of familiar names in the chat

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,560
right now but i do um developer advocacy

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
um

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
developer relations with michelle here

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,320
at github and

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
my focus for the past couple years has

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,360
been around our api

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,519
in building things like github apps and

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
github actions and

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,959
now github integrations with twitch as

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,279
well

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,959
just for fun uh so i just kind of have a

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,519
lot of knowledge on how github's api

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,920
works

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,920
and because that knowledge i wanted to

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,519
well i do some live streaming myself

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
so i wanted to be able to connect my

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,600
github account to my twitch account

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,279
while so when i'm on live streams

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
uh people can interact with my github

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
repos and i can see that in my

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,839
my twitch chats and stuff like that and

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,360
i think it's a common

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
it's a common like use case i think a

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
lot of actually michelle you have a

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
bunch of twitch

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
integrations on your your account as

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
well i do

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,120
not as fancy as yours but i do have a

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,839
bunch of integrations a lot of mine

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,760
are like pre-built so i use a lot of

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
stuff like stream elements and stream

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
labs and things like that

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
um actually there's an australian

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,360
developer here who

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,320
um mail stream and he builds a lot of

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
integrations

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,519
um yeah that go nicely but essentially

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
they're all just browser sources so

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,880
anyway yeah and they're all built with

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,800
code too that's the other thing

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,640
is a lot of those so i use some stream

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
elements so so if you've ever seen my

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,200
streams on bw

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,040
which is right here um

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,279
there's like a little widget that shows

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,200
what's playing on my spotify

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
that's a stream elements plug-in that

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
someone else built using code

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,760
and instead of putting it on github they

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
just put on stream elements so if you

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
are familiar stream elements it's

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
just a place where you can also share

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,120
these little snippets of code um

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
kind of like a marketplace but it's all

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
well i think most majority is free you

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
might be able to

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,399
buy integration

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
okay yeah so what i'm getting at it's

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,200
like this integration that we're gonna

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,800
mess with like we could

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,399
package this up make it pretty and then

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
go throw it on stream elements

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
uh but one thing i sort of realized when

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
i started streaming a year ago

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
uh on twitch is that a lot of these

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
integrations like a lot of people don't

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,959
share the code

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
a lot of people don't talk about the

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,120
code even like even the live coders like

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
sometimes it's hard to even find like

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
their github accounts or

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
their repos they're working on and i

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
just want to make a lot easier for

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
when you're writing code on twitch how

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
can folks

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
get connected to their code on github

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,760
while you're doing that

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
um because all this stuff is open source

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
github's like kind of the

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,279
well it is a home for open source home

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
for a ton of developers all developers

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
and i just want to make it so much

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,160
easier for uh for that so that's what

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
this is

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,560
git twitch it talks from it talks to

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
from github's api using web hooks to

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
twitch

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,880
uh and that's sort of the well we'll get

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
it to sort of have the nuts and bolts

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,279
but um

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
i think we have some more questions in

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,399
there we do and i think a couple of

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,000
questions around too like what

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,079
what are we trying to do and now

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,399
obviously if a lot of you have

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,399
joined in on some live streams on either

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,519
b doggies channel my channel or any

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,040
other channels

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,639
you'll notice that obviously someone

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
follows there's nearly always an alert

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
that pops up on the stream you know

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,560
there's a little gif and there's some

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,880
sound and there's alert saying thank you

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
uh

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
bw for following and you'll get

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
something so the idea is to do some more

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,079
integrations like that with github

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
so we got there dave said like if

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,800
someone did a git push to our repo

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
um the bot on twitch would let us know

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,399
yeah maybe it's a

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
maybe it's a little um thank you like

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
thank you dave core for making push but

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
also we want notifications to pop up on

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,320
stream like

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,240
you know this um this one that b-doggy's

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
got on screen or maybe that pops up and

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,880
says

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,680
dude you got some cool music going it's

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,240
like dave cool has pushed to

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,600
this repo or even like i just i double

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,000
checked before but i'd already started

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
this repo but even if we start a repo

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
maybe it pops up and there's stars

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
everywhere like you know basically we

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
wanted to make some

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,720
more um fun on-screen and

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,720
in-stream interactions when you're

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,800
actually interacting with github because

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,839
as b-doggy said um you know a lot of

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,600
a lot of streamers that are live code is

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,200
there's not there's not that much that

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
you can do like it's

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,880
it's like oh how do i find my my github

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,079
of you know go down

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,760
and search around look at it or

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,160
you know hopefully it lines up and it's

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,120
the same thing now vw sent me

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,440
a a link which is actually locked i'm

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,920
not sure why it's locked

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
oh is it locked yeah it's locked for me

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,440
oh why it's work

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
um but yeah like as daryl duck said as

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
well like you know

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,279
if someone forks it copies it opens up

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,600
makes a push makes a pull request like

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,519
vdoggy's idea about this is to build it

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,120
so that you can change what you want

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,519
like in the same way you can choose to

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
show alerts of followers subs bits

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,560
cheers

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,480
whatever it happens to be we want you to

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,680
be able to use this to integrate

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,519
github and twitch however you like

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,519
oh there we go yeah so the link i sent

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,839
you is the the bay bot and i don't know

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,639
why it was locked for you but um yeah

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,720
there we go

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,880
so this was like my first introduction

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
into twitch integrations

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,959
um not using github but specifically

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,959
this twitch integrations general so

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,480
there's a live coder called instafluff

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,639
he um has an awesome channel you should

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,079
definitely follow him uh he built this

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,760
thing called comfy.js

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,839
which is an sdk and i use the term sdk

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,079
sdk is like a software developer kit

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
uh it basically takes your api and it

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,839
makes really

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,480
approachable interfaces with it so this

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,079
one's in

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
javascript so like i write a lot of

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,880
javascript um i'm able to

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,079
do chat commands so usually a chat

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
command

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,680
some people are here i do like basically

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
exclamation point

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,079
uh yo and that's a way for people to say

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,399
hello when they come into the chat or if

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
we

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,440
just want to get hyped uh and what

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
happens there if you scroll down to the

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
bottom

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,000
uh there should be an animation animated

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,839
gif of this happening

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,160
so that's the uh that's the yellow

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
happening uh which is basically brandon

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,279
comes in the chat

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,720
types in yo he lets me know i'm here and

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,399
then brandon's it says on the screen

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,920
that brandon's hype so that's

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519
that's the basics of my bay bot uh and

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
it was like my introduction to try to

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
build chat integrations and the one

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
thing i want to point

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
out too as well is like these all exist

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,000
and you can do a stream element or

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,600
um all these other tools to sort of

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
install this uh brandon here's his name

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,639
he's

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,120
he's in the chat uh his ears are burning

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,880
but

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
what i'm getting at is when i first

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
tried to build these there was like not

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
a lot of information on how to build

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
these

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,639
um so from scratch a lot of folks just

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,399
kind of pointed you to stream elements

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,320
and i just wanted to build it to learn

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,399
because like i know how to code

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
so i figured i'd just jump in and it

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
took a lot of work

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,720
so in that actual readme uh it's

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
actually instruction

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,160
on how to build it yourself um so i

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,959
wrote a whole blog post and then put it

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
into

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,360
uh in the readme as a blog and tutorial

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,240
of how you can sort of do that and the

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,480
beauty of it

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
is that this this bay bot is hosted on

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
github pages

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,920
so that's the other thing is that you

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
don't have to have a server or anything

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
else running just to get this one

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,759
integration working

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
uh you just simply put fork the repo

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
and actually deploy it to a github page

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
by just going into settings and then

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,680
taking a get a page url

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,480
and throwing into a browser source and

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,720
then you have a chat integration

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,639
um also keep in mind you need to put

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
your your account it's actually in the

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
documentation but

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
you don't switch from my name to your

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,040
name github account

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,560
uh because otherwise you'd only be

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,759
getting integrations when people talk to

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,639
me in my chat and that would be

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,639
awkward like you're just like randomly

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,680
so it was like hi video like

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,279
what that'd be annoying for both

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
the person who's trying to set up the

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,399
new but also for you right

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
could you be getting changes in sources

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,120
yeah and i think

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,639
it's actually funny because i've

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,680
actually gotten people

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,480
who weren't in my chat but were testing

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
it

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,079
like you could tell they were testing

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,360
that because i have a a youtube video

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,919
that i do this too as well on a blog

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,039
post

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,360
so you can tell people are reading the

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
blog post while it was live on stream

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,799
or while it wasn't live on stream and

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,120
like the integration was just go like

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,919
the

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,959
chat ops where this happened uh which is

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,000
hilarious um

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,720
a way to put my my uh my name out there

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
i think it's great like i think i'll say

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
this to you v dougie on one of our

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,280
meetings that like

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
one of the things i love about live

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,679
coders and about developers being able

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
to do

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,200
like code on twitch is they

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,760
theoretically should have the best like

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
interactions and engagement on twitch

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,360
because you can essentially

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,440
code and build whatever you want and so

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,160
i've jumped into obviously insta flop

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,400
has some

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
really cool stuff on his channel and um

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,440
some of the other live coders actually

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,840
are um hired by twitch to build

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,039
integrations and so yeah some of the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
stuff they have on their channels is

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
really cool like one of them is like

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,080
when you come into raid there's all

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
these things like fire off over the

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,360
screen and like all his viewers have to

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,520
try and stop you raiding

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
and they like try and like it's really

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,799
fun so i love the fact that there's all

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,679
these things that we can do

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,280
um and we have got a few questions don't

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
worry we're not avoiding them i'm

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
banking them up in my head but one

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,520
question we've got

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
um there is um as um duckman uh daryl

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,280
says there

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,799
can we see an example of it um and you

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
can obviously see it in the right me so

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,600
you can see

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,120
there's one here um i think there's a

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
few other examples you've got there as

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,039
well

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,120
otherwise you can always jump into

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,600
bdoggy's uh twitch channel

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,360
watch it watch them all happening live

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
yeah it will probably happen like 20

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,320
times during my stream so if i stream

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
for two hours

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
there will at least be 20 people who

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,400
have typed in yo

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
or pizza or welcome i've got a welcome

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
chat to

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,440
our chat integration too as well i think

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,960
it's amazing i can't wait to set this up

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
for mine this is one of the reasons why

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,280
i'm doing it so i can learn to set this

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
up too

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
we've got a couple of questions though

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,960
before we jump into the next sandwiches

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,160
um is github pages like aws lambda

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
yeah i think uh brian or b ryan uh

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
he he explained it uh ghetto pages is

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,640
kind of the predecessor to things like

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,440
netlify

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
and uh purcell vercell does a bit of

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
extra stuff too as well with the the

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
sort of

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
functions built in and even netlify at

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
this point but um

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,160
inside of building let's say a

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,799
javascript app or a

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,720
static static site generated app you can

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,000
build it to html files

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
so a lot of what you're going to see

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,559
soon when we start integrating this chat

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,200
integration

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,039
is that we're just putting html files uh

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,799
on the screen like literally

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,559
actually what's above our head and

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,160
what's below our head that's an image

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,240
but we could just as easily make that

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,720
html file uh even better

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
my example in my readme if you look on

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
the side

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,559
of my of my live stream so scroll up

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,799
just one more

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,840
on the side there and everything around

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,000
in the black box

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,000
is actually a gatsby site so it's a

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,039
statically generated react site

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
um that i've created with a url that's

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,960
actually hosted on github pages as well

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,720
and i'm able to on the fly i can change

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,520
the the urls

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
on the page uh using a browser source uh

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
same thing with the

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
chat integration that's sort of popping

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
in on the bottom

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
that's also a browser source i don't

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,320
maintain that one i've actually built

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,159
one

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,919
a couple times and i've just never been

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,919
able to make a better version than what

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
stream elements is providing so i just

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
always end up using theirs

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
um but i do have it on my list to

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
actually build a better chat integration

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,919
that does

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,120
cooler stuff than the sort of out of the

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
box

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,000
colorful words on black screens

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
i think speaking of cool stuff shall we

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
jump into it i'm sorry

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
yeah yeah so if you just want to go to

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
the get twitch one

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,280
so there's gonna be things for the bay

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
bot that is included in git twitch

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,000
so that's which is why we're going to

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,799
skip over baby i just wanted to give

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
people

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,640
a more introductory experience just

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
because that one actually has a good

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
readme

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,960
this one is a very limited readme that i

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,760
just wrote tonight

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,600
so um it's getting there it says to be

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
continued

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
yes yes stay on the edge of your seats

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,039
but also it's open source that's the

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,480
beauty of this is that you can just jump

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,880
in there and

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,559
improve it um as to your heart's content

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
but i think the first step to

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,919
it to actually start using this is

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,919
actually fork it

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,679
uh so if you want to go ahead and hit

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,799
the fork button

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,799
to me yeah you should fork it to me

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,080
oh yeah sorry guys um we

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,360
do have um

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,679
unfortunately we have times out timeouts

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,159
yeah so we we actually because github is

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,559
a known property on twitch we do have to

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,400
do night watch and we can't actually

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,640
have you pace urls

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
um but i can always pay stuff and i can

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,919
also unban you

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,919
as a moderator on the channel for some

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,240
reason my mod settings

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
aren't working at the moment so that's

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,360
okay i'll just pop out the chat again

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,840
and we'll see if we can um keep the mod

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,400
settings going so i can

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,159
unban you all at some point nope still

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,880
not working

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,080
uh there we go got it all right we can

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,600
unban you now

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,679
that'll teach you yeah that'll teach you

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
for trying to try to be helpful

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,799
all right cool so we forked up now what

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,640
do we do

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,960
we're also going to go through it really

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,320
really basically so if anyone has never

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
done this before

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,520
you will know exactly what to do so i'm

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
going to ask b doggy

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
all the questions on everything so we

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
know exactly what to do

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,679
and if anyone is going to come back and

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
watch this one afterwards either on

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
youtube or on twitch here

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
you'll know exactly what's happening

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,000
hopefully

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,760
yep sounds good so data we have actually

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
have the steps written down so first

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
step is fork it

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
uh the second step is open a code space

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,760
now this is an optional step

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,000
um that uh you might not have access to

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
code

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
space you should probably sign up for

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,720
code spaces and probably reach out to

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,640
somebody on this channel who's

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,760
hosting it and maybe we can help you out

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
um but

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,039
i highly recommend it uh because it's

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
gonna be easy for me and michelle to

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,840
collaborate

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
uh without worrying about like local

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,240
environments and stuff like that

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,760
so you guys are protecting your jobs for

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
not answering yeah well

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,200
as i said we'll get to some of the

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
questions later like you know the one

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
about what code

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
base is github built on um we'll talk

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
about that a little bit later now we

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,360
want to get to yeah

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,960
unless you want to give a 30-second

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,280
response

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,400
uh it's sort of out of band really for

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
what we're talking about but like the

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
interview process at github

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,080
it's it's different depending on the

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,600
team so exactly i had a very different

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
interview experience to you

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,000
probably yeah and like you converted as

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,400
a from contractor to hire too as well

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,840
which

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
is a whole different experience because

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,000
you're already in but my experience is

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
actually the funny thing is i have a

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,520
youtube account and i talk about this

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
and it's like the first video that yells

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,960
at you so i would actually before i even

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,240
go

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
into that i would say just go to my

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,279
youtube account

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,720
and i have a youtube video called how i

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,679
got my job at github and it actually

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
explains it all

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,520
which is the beauty of social media and

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
having stuff pre-prepared

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
uh so that way the questions answer but

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
i would say the the enterprise process

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,279
is

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,320
um because i have a technical and a

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,960
hybrid role

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,080
my technical screen uh was briefer than

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,120
normal engineering's

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,080
uh it there's too many eyes in that one

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,120
that i like robot apologies my

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,480
keyboard's normally

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,080
made for vim and not for uh not for

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,279
chatting on twitch right

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,640
shots fired yeah but i

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,799
said that's the case and then stack at

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
github uh github's a very large company

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,080
we're almost 2000 employees we have a

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,440
very large engineering team

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,120
we can't answer the question what the

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
stack of github is because we had such a

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,400
large product

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
so it uses everything it originally was

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,799
a ruby on rails project uh back in the

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
day

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,799
but it's now ruby on rails with injected

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,279
servers and kafka and java

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
and rust clones and we have some elixir

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,080
and small plate like a very

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,000
i'm not even sure it's still in

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,600
production but we're just doing so much

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
stuff that we can't answer that question

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,720
like that so what we do is we hire

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,600
engineers

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,960
who can engineer um so we we and it's

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,640
actually not even microservice it's

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,039
actually and sorry i'm reading the the

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,200
chat

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,240
uh daryl say microservices it's a

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,360
monorepo

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,520
that has microservices sort of attached

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
so i don't know how to explain this but

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
it's something

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,320
someone mentioned netlify earlier

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,080
netlify was my former employer

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,919
we also had a very similar structure we

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,400
had a repo

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,440
which a bunch of microservices attached

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,360
to the monorepo

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,799
to make it work that's just kind of how

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,880
cloud works um

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,480
and yeah once you get this big you sort

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
of start engulfing

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,080
all different types of languages and

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,760
frameworks this is what we do we just

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,919
engulf things don't we

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
um all right let's get back to this so

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
i've forked and you mentioned opening

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,559
code space i'm assuming

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,000
what we need to do now is i go back to

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,600
my repo and when i it correct

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,159
yes so you've worked it uh you want to

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
open up your fork uh and then open up a

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
code space

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,760
so let's go code spaces open code spaces

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,000
new code space all right

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,840
yeah we've got new code space now this

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,039
this usually doesn't take too long we

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,240
actually do a video on this a little

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,200
while ago on how quick

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
a code space works um anyone who is

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
tuning in

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,919
from melbourne or knows how bad the

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
internet here is in australia this takes

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,760
a little while so usually

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,440
i think i calculated it when i was in

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,679
the us or like i think

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
you might have done it too um ryan was

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,679
it takes about like

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
not like less than a minute but in

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,720
australia it took about five

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,400
so we're gonna see how long it takes

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,600
today um to build this code space

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,039
it actually took five minutes in

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,640
australia there's not much that it's

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,080
installing so we do

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,679
because we don't have any no a ton of

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
node modules we have like probably

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,240
two um we don't have to wait for node

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
modules and stuff like that there we go

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,840
it's done oh no it still says

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
configuring still getting this sorry

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,000
straight yeah and actually while this is

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,520
working um i can explain a bit of the

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,559
project too as well

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
um and actually we're going to install a

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
couple different we'll install one

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
thing and then we'll have to also set up

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,480
a webhook server or webhook receiver

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,320
um which i am prepared to explain

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
uh so we've just basically we got the

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,679
code space we're

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,200
essentially just in step one

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,960
which is great these code spaces it

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,360
gives you a full

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,200
browser environment with vs code that's

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,080
connected to your github repo

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,679
automatically which sort of removes all

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
the sort of extra trying to figure out

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
how to

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,679
make sure your environment works locally

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,000
like do you have m

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,679
do you have node uh 14 do you have node

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,279
15 do you have node 10

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,720
like we don't have to know what node

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,600
version you have michelle on your

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
machine

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,640
because the code space is going to have

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,080
the latest and greatest for us

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
exactly and i think the other cool thing

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
about code space too is you can

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
basically develop

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
from anywhere in the world now all you

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,840
need is a laptop and a

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,039
like an internet connection so maybe not

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,039
anywhere in the world there's lots of

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,480
parts of australia without internet

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,640
but you know if you have internet

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
connection and a laptop like any kind of

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,640
laptop you can pretty much run

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,799
anything and start developing code and

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,399
deploying code instead of waiting

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,799
weeks and weeks and weeks to get the

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,720
right develop machine or to get access

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,840
to certain projects

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,640
or just to get admin rights or whatever

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,360
like this just

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,039
opens it and if this is almost done it

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,039
looks like it's done

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,880
that looked on looks down i just said

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,720
welcome to me

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,200
uh you could probably copy and paste uh

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,279
number two uh and this is actually

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
it's gonna install you know what that's

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,159
the wrong

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,360
apologies that's the wrong command that

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,320
says install npm right

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,640
no no it's npm install but it's actually

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,399
smee-client

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,200
um i've made that mistake before so

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,240
i'm gonna actually update that on the

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,440
upstream

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,279
hey i wanna update it how do i do that

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
oh perfect actually i got a question on

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,240
this

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
so if i wanted to update your readme

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
should i update it on

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,559
mine and then send back or what is the

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
best what is the best protocol if i was

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,320
wanting to update so first step would

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,200
have been create a fork which you're

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
already there

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,039
uh second step is just edit the readme

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,760
directly in your repo

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,399
nice in my reaper okay yes and then we

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,960
create a pair okay so if we edit this

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,960
um no that's back

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
now we've got the edit button okay so

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
what's the correct command here so

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,159
on line two it should be smee dash

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,080
client

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,440
see dash

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,440
with the space yeah no space

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
like that yeah connect that so it's like

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
one word yep

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
essentially and then make sure your dash

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,480
g still is there

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,480
is that it's not

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,080
i think you have a insert typing on i do

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,200
so we want smee dash

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,520
client oh we do have insert typing it's

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
me

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,120
dash client dash g was that what you

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,200
wanted yeah dash g

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,960
uh but the g it needs a space between oh

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,120
yeah i was like dash before that

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,320
yeah yeah so this is basically just

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
taking npm

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,240
installing it globally uh to your

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
environment

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,600
now this is something that with code

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,919
spaces i could have set up beforehand

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
but i didn't uh but we'll just end up

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
just running this locally anyway so if

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
you want to open a pr i can

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
i can merge that on here so i can go

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,520
commit

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,799
is that how i do it uh yeah you can

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,840
commit to your main branch

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,039
uh and then you'll need to open up a pr

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,840
so we go to full request here yep

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,840
new pull request

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,760
and then we go is that right going from

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,080
the base

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,279
so it's going to my main branch uh from

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,960
your main branch

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,480
uh you can see our files change right

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,919
here

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
so it looks about good create a pull

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,480
request

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,559
and uh

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
that's just that's descriptive enough i

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
guess

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
uh so now now we'll check on the uh the

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,240
code space and see if it's ready

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,159
if it's uh so it was npm well we'll make

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,320
sure we fix that as well so it was

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,320
npm install

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,000
dash oh snake dash

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,440
client that was it wasn't it

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,159
yes don't remember that correctly

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,200
i think i did mitch did a dab task move

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:42,720
the kanban card

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,919
move it we have actions that move

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,240
our cards automatically from in progress

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,640
to

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,679
shipped so there you go excellent

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,640
oh yeah um daryl did make actually

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,720
before i answered

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,840
daryl's comment uh i'm curious do you

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,840
have any questions of what we just did

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,080
i love it anyone got any questions

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,840
oh no i was asking if you had a question

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,240
on what you just entered me

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,679
oh wow okay i was like that was like no

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
question i was like i'll let the chat up

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,200
with questions

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,880
yeah because like yeah one thing that's

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,960
dangerous is uh blindly

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,080
pasting in commands from random places

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,320
and random people

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,080
so i'm glad you're just a random person

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,679
yeah so we basically just installed the

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,679
smee client uh globally

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,279
in this environment uh daryl did make a

00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,559
comment about um

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:51,039
the brian got hit again with this

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,000
time the uh uh doing mpx instead of

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,480
using this me

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,640
uh doing um installing it globally

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
is good uh but the only issue is the

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
next command we're about to do is not

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,760
speed client and sometimes when the mpx

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
commands don't match

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,440
with the actual command i found

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,840
conflicts

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,039
um so which is why we're using npx npx

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,240
is a way to install

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,440
and run at the same time um so the next

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,200
thing we're going to be doing

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,399
is not running the command we actually

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
have to set up some environment

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:23,279
variables

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,880
um so can you go back to the readme and

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,240
let's keep me honest oh actually next

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,519
thing we do is we have to create a speed

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
channel

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,240
it's my channel yeah so you'll you'll go

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,080
to uh the readme and click that link

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,679
um in a new tab meet.io

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,360
would you like to explain to people what

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,960
sme is

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,360
yeah and this is a something that comes

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,640
up a lot in in whenever i share it

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,720
um smee is a web hook receiver uh so

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,880
with github to be able to talk to github

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,320
or actually have github talk to twitch

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,240
or to obs

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,600
uh get up's gonna be sending web hooks

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,399
from the repos that we're gonna be

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
watching

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,840
uh and those web hooks are basically

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,240
like is if i were to make a text message

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,760
and said to michelle um that's gonna go

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,880
to michelle and she's gonna receive it

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,960
on her phone

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,639
at the moment we don't have any way to

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,760
receive these web hooks because we're

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,599
doing some local

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
development environment uh some

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,720
production stuff like vercell

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,560
um who leveraged like sakuraio or um

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,800
the other one ws they will do

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,800
web hook maneuver question mark uh

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,200
anyway uh i'll pause on that but yeah

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,399
basically they received the the web hook

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,079
uh so smee is kind of like ngrok

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,679
uh if you ever heard of ingrock ingrock

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,079
is another place for being able to

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,280
tunnel

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,079
apis uh smee actually is

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,359
it basically is uh in a i guess you

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,200
could call it a middleware

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,280
um but yeah it sits in the middle

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,960
between your local host

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,200
and the production app you're trying to

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,599
do and it's a way for us to test this

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,079
now you might not have heard of smee

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,760
because it was built by github employees

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,119
and github employees to kind of test our

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,680
web hooks internally

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,599
without paying you know money elsewhere

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,599
uh and it sort of solves our problems

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,359
it is open source and usable by anybody

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,839
who wants it we don't really advertise

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
it

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,200
um but in this use case in sort of the

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,359
training environment where

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
we're sort of in right now uh or sort of

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,040
the learning environment

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
sme is a really good cool tool to use um

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,680
so

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,280
i'm super happy that github gives this

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
away for free and like makes this

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,720
available to everybody

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,880
sounds good all right so i clicked

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,599
create new channel

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
yep and that channel url is something

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,359
we're going to need to hold on to

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,760
um so i would just keep this tab open

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,640
uh and then we're going to you probably

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,800
want to copy this

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,160
me url to as well to your clipboard

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,240
and the next step we're going to do is

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,920
actually create a web hook so we'll just

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,440
go ahead and create a web hook

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,280
now we can create a web hook on your

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,480
repo that's probably the best place the

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,440
one that you forked

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,640
yep cause i think it yeah so at this

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,520
point it's low stakes

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,960
um so uh low stakes says in like we

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,760
don't have to worry about your

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,040
your get twitch fork um being exposing

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,359
secrets and stuff like that

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,560
yeah um so at this point you want to go

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,200
into your developer settings for the

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
repo

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,720
so if you go into the settings uh which

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,839
i think it's gonna be the uh

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,520
yeah yeah there we go and then on the

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,839
left in that panel it's gonna say web

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,839
hooks

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,000
and these this is gonna be a way we can

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,720
send the uh the messages

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,400
back and forth i will let you have a

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,760
chat to people while i put in all my

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,960
passwords and

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,760
yes github being um

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,920
being really really cool good on

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,520
security now every time you

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,400
do anything you gotta check security and

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,920
credentials

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,680
okay so i'm gonna show you that payload

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,200
url goes in here

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,280
that's where the speed url goes um

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,079
and the speed url that's basically

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,240
you're telling github this github repo

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,839
to essentially res uh send all its web

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,200
hooks directly to me

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,880
and what we're gonna do with smee is

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,280
we're gonna talk to our our

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,040
our app that we have in a code space uh

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,480
to be able to receive those and see that

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,079
sort of console logging

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,440
now normally what i was getting at is

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,240
normally you put this in a production

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,000
environment

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
and all this would be handled like with

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,400
like a heroku or

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,359
aws or azure or whatnot but since we're

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
not going to deploy anything to

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,800
production we're just going to basically

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,440
just set this up the way it is

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
sounds good so we just leave it as it is

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,119
yeah

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,000
and i think that dave core actually um

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,079
is

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
has a i don't know a question oh

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,240
question so smee receives the web hook

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,200
and pushes something to twitch or the

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,440
twitch pop

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,040
pulls everything from smee every x

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,520
seconds or something so yeah

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
it's it's not polling it's actually

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,000
receiving

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,720
so every time we push from github

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,920
or we create a web hook from github uh

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,280
so that's what michelle did which

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,359
actually michelle you need to edit that

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,920
real quick um we'll have to do two more

00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,680
things

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,280
uh and apologies i didn't write this in

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,160
the doc in the readme

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,079
write it up now i'll update that later

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,599
uh or we can update this after but

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,079
we'll need to actually instead of

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,200
pushing everything directly to this web

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
hook

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,480
select only one in one event and i like

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,720
to pick events that are trivial

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,640
um that i can test really quickly so

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,000
what you'll want to do is scroll down

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,839
and pick the one that says stars

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
uh guest stars are super they're trivial

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,599
they're easy to sort of click on and off

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
and i would take off pushes take off

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,760
pushes yeah

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,079
and then there's gonna be one more thing

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,079
we need to do is we need to set a secret

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,119
yep do we want to show that on screen or

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,000
do i turn that one off

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,680
uh it it's pretty low stakes i tend to

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
always make my secret secret when i'm on

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,960
my live stream

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
um but you can also turn it off and make

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,320
it whatever you want

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,920
uh just note that uh with having the

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,960
secret enabled it means that we can't

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,040
get any server

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
the thing is like we have uh like 30 odd

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,760
people in the chat

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,160
so anybody can hit that web hook

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
manually and send random information to

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,760
us

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,119
that's what i was thinking i think we

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,560
just like randomly send stuff to me

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,760
there we go i know everybody here in

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,440
this chat is super nice but i've

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,240
actually seen others you never know

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,200
people people gonna watch the vod later

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,480
yeah

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
yeah actually i was on a stream with

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,240
contentful and we had a exposed uh

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,640
endpoint yeah it's good practice people

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,359
to

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,880
obviously this url um again i don't mind

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,599
if people are gonna see that one because

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,599
we're

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,320
gonna change that later but it's good

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,640
practice that um anytime you're

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,240
typing in passwords or showing anything

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,200
that could be potentially taken it's

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,920
always good to flick your screen off

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,599
yeah all right so we've done the smee

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,079
channel we created the web hook

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,200
it's me and everything is connected so

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,520
we're good there

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
um we now want to basically take that

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,119
smee url

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,640
uh and do one more thing uh where i need

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,000
to start the server

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,440
um so we go back in the code space back

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,880
to here

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,280
yes and we have that terminal that's

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,960
down there yep uh there we want to type

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,599
in smee

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,599
dash u so hyphen u

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,440
and this is basically that smee client

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
that we installed yeah we're basically

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,680
writing this now and then paste the

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,200
url cool what so this is basically

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,119
do you know why it's called smee like

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,720
every time i hear the word smee all i

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,720
think of is peter pan

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,240
like the dude calls me or peter pan i

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,960
think that might be the end the uh

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
inspiration

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,160
right really it's funny because the the

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,760
guy who interviewed me and we talked

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,720
about the interviews uh so let me talk

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,200
about my interview

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
because the guy who mates me um he

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,880
actually interviewed me at github

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,760
um and so i github i had the

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,839
introductory

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,680
process where uh people find out you

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,119
know like your background or whatever

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,440
uh and then you go through the process

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,520
of like the the um

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,480
what do you call it the informational

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,839
situational

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,520
interviews of like tell me a time we

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,800
needed this tell me time of that and

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,720
then i had a coding interview

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,400
a couple of them where one was a review

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,160
of pull quests which i loved

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,440
um they gave you a pull request and you

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,280
had to review the code

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,800
uh this is not for every team this is

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,560
for my experience just want to point

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,920
that out too as well uh we do have

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,240
centralized

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,920
every engineer interviews the same way

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,880
but that was not the case when i joined

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,440
um that back when i joined we were a

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,359
third

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,560
now a quarter of the size so we're four

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,560
times as big so there's way more

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,000
structure

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,440
but then my next interview was i had to

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,640
build something with the github api so i

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,000
had the api

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,160
uh which is funny because i loved

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,560
messing with the api before then i built

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,440
uh an entire platform at netflix using

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,520
the api

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,359
which is netlife deploys but what i'm

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,359
getting at is um

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,720
uh i just had to build the api but the

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,960
guy who interviewed me

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,160
he built me and uh he doesn't work at

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,240
github anymore but

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,920
uh that was like a long rambling story

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,240
to answer a question that somebody else

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,880
asked earlier

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,359
sounds good now do you know how to zoom

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,720
in on a code space

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,640
a code space it should be just like a

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,640
web browser yeah it's not working

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,200
oh and i have uh my code space

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,400
is yeah

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,800
i just hit the control plus and it's

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,040
bigger

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,000
so i'm doing it doesn't want to do it

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,079
for me um

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,880
well also uh while you're chatting i was

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,160
editing the read me file

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,599
yeah yeah i've tried control mouse but

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,440
obviously that's how i zoomed in here

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,480
before people why do you think we're

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,160
right now

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,359
150 because we zoomed in think it works

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,440
for this it just doesn't work for the

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,599
code space

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,359
yeah that's weird um i'm not sure if

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,839
it's my code space or if

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,280
i wasn't sure if crude space is just

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,359
yeah it might be your

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,240
code space maybe you have to refresh it

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,920
and get a new let's refresh it

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,920
or refresh your code space after that

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,040
we'll finish doing this so basically we

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,839
create the webhook

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,960
um under settings we paste this me url

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,640
in the url

00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,680
payload under here um

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,960
url you should probably put a screenshot

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,359
in there too as well

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,800
yeah we should i mean if we're going to

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,440
improve to read me might as well improve

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,839
the readme

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,839
exactly and it proves the raving um

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,079
yeah there's a lot of um i guess

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,359
debugging for the the zoom problem but

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,760
yeah it's weird because i literally have

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,119
a code space open up and a tab on my

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,440
my machine and uh zooming in works for

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,720
me

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
the other thing is probably just going

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,480
into the web browser are

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:41,839
and doing view in zoom

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,839
manually that's the other thing but here

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,280
no it's like this is a code space which

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,440
is slightly different

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,920
um okay that's just opening up different

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,920
terminals

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,760
no problems were detected okay what if

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,280
we

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,720
i don't know let's just try to refresh

00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,760
it again we'll just say what browser are

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,040
you in chrome

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,720
yep we are in the chrome

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,560
and you're not using an extra extension

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,079
to do dark mode you're doing the native

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,079
dark mode yeah this is all

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,160
github native dark mode people because

00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,800
you know github is dark mode now which

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,800
is amazing

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,119
uh okay oh because it's on um

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,640
it's created a new environment so this

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,520
one's obviously all native so dark

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,319
mode's turned off here

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,079
so we're using the native github dot oh

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,359
the good old what browser you use in

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,720
question

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,040
you know how many you know how many

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,839
times i've solved bugs because

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,920
i find out someone using safari or using

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,560
uh what's it brave browser

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,280
just asking the browser narrows out so

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,839
many

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,319
questions because like the the sort of

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
uh

00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,440
earlier this year we had a cookie change

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,599
in chrome

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,520
where now chrome will not let you send

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,560
like what we're about to do send

00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,160
web hooks or um api calls uh

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,079
from one browser like from port 3001 or

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,800
to port 3002.

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,720
um that was like a pain point in some of

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,760
the code i was doing earlier this year

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,440
um and yeah i just

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,040
sort of figured out that it was chrome

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,040
and then when i fixed it in chrome

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,079
then found out the brave browser was

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
another problem

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,000
and at github we have lots of users

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,160
using all different types of browsers

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,839
so yeah that's i always ask that

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,240
question that's always there yeah what

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,319
are you using what browser using

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,000
all right let's let's plot that

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,119
screenshot in here

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,200
[Applause]

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:42,880
junk it's gonna work

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,000
maybe not uh it won't work in here

00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,480
because the

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the readme will not you actually have to

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,200
for readme you actually have to have the

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,079
file locally

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,160
oh yes that's correct that's right you

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,720
can put in a screenshot

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,160
ah yes i could totally do that just make

00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,520
you do some more work

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,839
all right let's go back to the code

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,200
space now unfortunately we can't

00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,319
actually zoom in

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,800
on the code space which is super weird

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,240
everyone's like i love github have you

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,079
given up on ie

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,839
who's who's we um uh i think uh i think

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,400
most of the developers have given up an

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,400
ie

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,240
um there are still people supporting it

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,200
in certain instances but i think edge is

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,480
the future

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,880
yeah at this point okay so hook was

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,839
after

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,920
so what are we doing back in this code

00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,839
space uh so in the codes

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,599
where are we at well we just did connect

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,200
to the web hook oh so now we basically

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,839
need we have the smee still running is

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,040
that correct

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,000
uh i hope so i don't know i refreshed it

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,920
so we might have to

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,280
enable it or uh yeah you might have to

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,000
do um

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,400
uh type its me dash u and then the url i

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,640
think you all need to um

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,160
do it again yes we will need to grab

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,599
back so don't forget to go back to our

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,079
url

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,000
grab that paste it and plonk it in there

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,359
and see if that works

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,240
okay it's connected okay i wish we could

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,440
zoom in on this

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,720
oh hey that's the um the search button

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,839
not the zoom button

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
it's so weird that this is your is your

00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,440
monitor just like massive

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,160
oh what happened there oh it just

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,800
started working

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,240
okay maybe it is maybe it's because

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,599
we're you're streaming from obs

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,480
sometimes obs can

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,680
kind of kill my processor so like doing

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,680
something as simple as

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:34,079
command plus uh and yeah that can also

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:39,839
be hard no it doesn't matter where i am

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,839
no i tried doing different things anyway

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,680
you'll have to kill smee because we just

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,920
real i just realized that um

00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,359
it's actually keeps me running okay it's

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,640
still running

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,800
okay so you actually have to create an

00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,319
environment so go to the dot

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,880
did i i didn't actually put this in the

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,119
list either how many things did you miss

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,040
in the list

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,319
it's i figured you know error driven

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,000
development at this point

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,520
uh so there is a um a file

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,079
okay we're gonna do this one so we're

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,960
gonna go update

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:23,440
the smart url web book

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,240
okay done all right so what do we need

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
to actually

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,920
yeah you might as well keep that pr open

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,960
because there'll be more things okay

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
there's more things guys so going back

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,839
to your um

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,040
code space okay go back to my code space

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,839
yeah so there's a file

00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,599
called.emv.example

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,680
uh you'll just want to copy and paste

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,720
that into a new file

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,160
into a new file yeah and this is like

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,839
one of the things i just um

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,920
i made a lot of assumptions but just

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,079
create a new file yeah called dot e and

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,200
b

00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,599
and they got example as well no

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,359
just enb because this one's the real

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,040
thing okay now normally

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,720
what you do is you don't want to share

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,720
this um in

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,720
the marketplace right now the vs code is

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,359
actually asking you to install a plug-in

00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,400
so that way it masked the the code that

00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,160
you're about to put in

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,520
this is the same secret you put inside

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,079
the web hook that's

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,359
yep okay so you just want to put that

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,200
there and then

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,559
you should be able to just move away

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,040
from that screen and that's all you have

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,400
to do

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,599
yep done we

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,520
are back there we go

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,040
excellent uh so you should be in the

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:37,040
back of the code space

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:40,000
yep excellent and then um

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,359
so now we can go ahead and run npm start

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,920
in a new tab

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,160
um so if you go to terminal yeah there

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,160
you go

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,359
and that should now uh before porting

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,040
open the browser open in browser that's

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,559
something that when you use vs codespace

00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,079
you don't want to close that box

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,680
so open in browser this one yeah cool

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,599
so we've got some questions from people

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,960
saying they've just swung by and saw

00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,720
github is streaming we are creating

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,599
twitch integrations and github

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,520
integrations so basically when you

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,599
are on stream with someone you follow

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,960
someone usually get a fancy notification

00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,640
we want to do the same thing

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,839
for github so if someone starts your

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,440
repo forks it creates a pull request

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,520
you want to know and you want your

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,880
viewers to know as well

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,480
so there we go that's what we're doing

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,079
yeah i really wish twitch would

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,960
integrate inside of github

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:37,040
um my dad if we know people on the

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,040
twitch dev team we should just ask them

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,800
all right this this is our url

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,559
so this url is um that is pretty much it

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,640
it should be blank

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,000
no and that's what it is uh so if you go

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,640
back to the console or sorry

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,599
the the terminal uh we now have port

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,520
server 3000 working uh and then go back

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,359
to the the blank screen just open up the

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,800
the chrome console i just want to make

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,800
sure there's not an error message

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,000
oh there is our error message there's

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,280
one more thing we have to do

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,839
okay um and that is also super small

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
okay what else do we need to do uh we

00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,319
need actually

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,000
uh i actually did this intentionally

00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,559
because i wanted to force myself to talk

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,359
about

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,680
um how this is working so in the era of

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,680
the local host 3000 that got opened up

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,800
in the other tab yeah this is not

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,520
working because

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,119
with localhost um with the browser that

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,839
gets open it's 18 it's

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,880
it's ssl encrypted and because we're

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,079
doing localhost

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,520
locally it's not ssl encrypted so

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,280
this is something i should probably have

00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,119
in the readme as a note

00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,480
that you'll need to change it if you're

00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,200
doing in the browser or not in the

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,640
browser

00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,480
um so inside this file um go back in the

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
the code yep this gives me an

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,319
opportunity to talk about the code so

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,000
here we've got a a couple different

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,440
things we've got index.js

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,280
so that's where our web hook if you want

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,760
to click on the index.js

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,400
uh sorry as the file that file yeah oh

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,000
it's like um

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,000
yeah this is this is how the web hooks

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,599
are working so this is the the websocket

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,520
package that we're leveraging

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,880
um this is that's the web hook secret

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,520
online um

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,760
what was that 10. uh and then we're also

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,520
using octokit's web hooks library

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,520
so this is make it so much easier it's

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,280
sdk for the web hooks

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,040
and github to talk to them within this

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,319
code uh and then we're doing a couple

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,359
different things it's sort of grabbing

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,240
the sender

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:30,000
and how it's sort of um received and

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,400
printing that to the console so

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,520
when someone starts the repo uh we will

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,559
see who started

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,839
based on their github account and that's

00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,200
pretty much like we do have some other

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,839
stuff that's happening below and that's

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,160
sort of the

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,680
web hooks sending and receiving there

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
and then we do have an error message as

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,440
well

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,920
and this is on line 13. uh this is sorry

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,640
it said

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:56,720
that wasn't 13. 23. 23.

00:52:52,640 --> 00:53:00,480
no sorry what was that why did i say 13.

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,720
1 3. you know sorry 33 oh 33

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,480
okay there we go yes so we're actually

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,760
using express and express is a way to

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,400
get a really quick server

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,440
a web server up uh in javascript or node

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,200
specifically

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,480
that express server is pointing to the

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,800
public folder

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,319
um so you can see on line 36 it says

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,319
public that's where our static

00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,559
output is so that came up in the chat

00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:23,520
earlier uh with like netlify

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,440
um so open up your public folder there

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,200
will be an index.html

00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,359
and this is like the the beauty of

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,400
browser sources and just having simple

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,440
html files

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,359
that's what this is um so we're pulling

00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,960
in copyjs which got mentioned earlier

00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,720
with the bay bot

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:43,839
and then on line 12 no 13

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,960
this is 13 needs to be instead of ws

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,240
it needs to be wss and that's the only

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,440
that's the biggest difference

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,960
and i left it there intentionally

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,680
because i needed to slow myself down to

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,760
explain

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,720
how this works uh so you should be able

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,440
to save that

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,440
and now local host 3000 will work

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,400
refreshing i really won't apologize for

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,720
the sound someone just decided to

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,440
start mowing outside my window at three

00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,040
o'clock on a friday afternoon

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,359
it's you got to do it someday i know

00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,760
i'll keep muting myself when i'm not

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,800
talking so you don't have to listen to

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,359
the terrible ballooning

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,160
so we just saw an animated gif to show

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,839
up uh

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:31,040
once we fix the server uh with the wwss

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,200
which was the ssl encryption um that is

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,680
our animated gif so that is

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,359
essentially what it's going to show uh

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,960
it just starts whenever you

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,119
start the server it will just show you

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,040
what the gif is this is not the best

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,599
code this is the easiest code to get

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,640
something

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,880
up on the screen um so now

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,680
we have to decide well actually we can

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,720
make this work

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,000
in a couple of different ways but one

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,119
thing you need to do is actually go back

00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,240
to the index stage

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,520
sorry go to the gift.js inside the

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,480
public folder

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,839
and we'll need to change it from bw to

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,839
mish manners

00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,839
on line 7.

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,359
yeah so that's gonna be your where your

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,680
repo is

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,359
and then line six like all this other

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,000
stuff is actually not as necessary to

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,319
change

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,240
um that's for baybot chat integrations

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,079
to work uh but we're not actually gonna

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,559
connect this directly to our chat

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,599
to github chat uh we're gonna actually

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,160
connect this to

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,280
the github repo so that's if you want to

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,880
go above and beyond

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,520
and connect it to your chat integration

00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,799
uh you just simply change it to

00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,799
um github

00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,040
and i think it needs to be lowercase

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,559
because that's the way um i think twitch

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,400
might be case sensitive

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,200
um based on the urls so yeah it should

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,200
be all lowercase

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,520
yeah and honestly i think i was looking

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,200
at that thing to say what um

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,680
yeah it's all lowercase and same with

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,960
the repo owner

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,240
this one's actually not talking to the

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,200
api it's actually just going to print

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,000
the screen so

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,440
uppercase is fine but for good practice

00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
i always tend to lowercase stuff when it

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,200
gets sent through web urls

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,400
because it's uh yeah

00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,400
sometimes that bites me uh for errors um

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,760
so we'll go ahead and save that uh we'll

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,839
refresh the um

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,839
the tab uh where we have the browser

00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,839
open

00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,720
now that's refreshing i'm going to shut

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,160
the window so we don't hear this guy as

00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,760
much and you can chat to the

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,280
to the people okay yeah so

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,760
the moment of truth actually is going to

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,440
be when we someone's going to have to

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,160
star the repo

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,000
um and that's pretty much the

00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,280
interaction at this point

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,640
we'll add some other i think we'll stick

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,280
with that interaction based on the time

00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,359
that we have

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,559
when we clean that up but yeah we

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:03,680
basically just need

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,040
somebody in the chat to star

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,000
actually did we get someone to start the

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,200
repo um

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
uh we could actually check by just

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:15,119
scrolling down on our server um

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,640
in the terminal yeah

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:22,160
server or start

00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:24,160
started okay also my window was shut

00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,359
that guy outside is having me very very

00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,000
loud and it wasn't

00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,040
a lawn mower it was a glass like a leaf

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,400
blower

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,440
instead no sorry there you go

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,839
so i think that um i think we have an

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,359
issue

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,880
an error message but this is actually a

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,160
good opportunity for us to check the

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,839
smee

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,720
um tab we need we can either check the

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:47,119
running space

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:50,319
yeah running people people are stuck how

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,319
many people are starting it

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,319
zoom that a bit yeah let's go into it

00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,799
look at that yeah so open up one of

00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:01,200
those uh just by clicking them

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,839
whoa so you can see that we're getting

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,640
we're getting

00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,000
actual stars happening but i think we

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,119
might have to restart our server i think

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,400
that's the issue

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,400
okay yeah we say mad 15 start that one

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,520
i'm just looking at the uh the payload

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,559
yeah

00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,680
it's yeah it's like the third line but

00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,040
up we should be getting mad 15's name uh

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,599
in the console so we'll have to figure

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
out

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,359
uh i think it's because we need to

00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,440
restart the server okay

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,880
so we need to go back to code spaces and

00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,040
then what do we do

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,920
uh can't kill this server and restart

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,839
that one

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,839
how do you kill it is it like command c

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,559
so your forwarded ports open in browser

00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,599
start okay

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,520
yeah so we're getting we're getting

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,520
folks starring the repo so that's

00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,799
actually looks fine

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,599
um not sure it should be showing up

00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,480
so like everything's working except the

00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,280
one thing that

00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,440
is probably not as important which is

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,599
essentially the server should say

00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:24,480
uh this user started the repo down here

00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,839
yes okay and i don't honestly not sure

00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,440
why it's not showing there it's not a

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,520
big deal to be quite honest

00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,119
because it is working we can see it

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,640
showing up

00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,119
and we do see that showing up in the

00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,400
logs uh can you just go over to

00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:41,520
um if that drop down error drop down

00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,040
um we have the different terminals this

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,720
one so right now it says four

00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,799
it says four empty yeah we've got a few

00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,119
of them oops oh maybe

00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,160
is that the issue how many can you just

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,079
go through

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,200
how many did we do okay we killed that

00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,280
one

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,240
oh so yeah that was smee we actually

00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,000
need that one running

00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,359
i think that's probably the issue let's

00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
how about we kill them all restart it

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,640
yeah yeah we've got two of each and we

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,400
don't need

01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,400
two of each okay

01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,480
so okay let's just okay so

01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,760
[Music]

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,160
that i don't think that actually got rid

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,040
of anything no it didn't

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,240
um where did my terminal go come back

01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,079
here terminal

01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,760
uh i think you should command j i think

01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,799
is yeah okay

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,200
all right sorry yeah okay and um saying

01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,359
only the server is running can you stop

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:35,119
the localhost 3000

01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,520
uh is that just that also yeah

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,640
yeah control c or keep pressing enter i

01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,079
keep forgetting that you don't need to

01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,400
press enter to like because it's all

01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,559
good

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,319
happening twice yeah so this

01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,760
should be smee or the other one if you

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,960
go into the other one that um had

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,040
smeared already running

01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,400
you should just be able to hit up yeah

01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,440
just hit up on the

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,000
keyboard and hit enter okay so now this

01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,359
is running

01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,280
i don't think it was actually running

01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,960
before um which is

01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,119
probably part of the problem and then

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,240
now go the other go to the other

01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,000
terminal or just any other one just only

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,520
we just only want to do this once

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,799
uh now do some npm start

01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:17,040
sorry people i got i got too excited

01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:19,839
there we go and just stay on this uh

01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,839
stay on that tab

01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:29,839
okay now yeah go back to your

01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,839
the tab um with the code space

01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,599
should we get rid of these other two

01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:40,960
terminals like just

01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,960
no they wouldn't be doing anything

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,200
okay i got rid of them they won't do

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,240
anything i got rid of them

01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,960
okay actually go up to uh smee you saw

01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,640
some output

01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,200
there if you scroll up

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,799
ah you know what it is uh bad requests

01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,400
yes scroll up to the top where you see

01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,640
the start of this

01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,839
uh this is an error message okay there

01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,799
we go oh okay

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,240
there we go error cannot post yeah yeah

01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,000
so we can't post and it's because we

01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,880
missed a step uh if you go back to your

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,119
web hook

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,000
uh we should be actually taking json uh

01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,160
i missed the

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,920
explanation of this uh on the content

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,839
type up on the top

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,640
yep uh you'll see there's a drop down

01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:24,000
yeah uh so

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:27,119
content type below uh

01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,200
so above secret oh sorry yep

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,039
there we go that should be json that's

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,520
the problem uh so the way this is

01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,160
written

01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,960
like i don't i'm not i'm expecting it to

01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,880
be json

01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,960
but i never told you i was expecting

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,640
json okay so

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,720
now it's working so that's what this

01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,039
explains why smee was getting

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,720
payload request but then we were looking

01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:50,720
here and we were getting nothing

01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:54,000
yep okay so i think at this point

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,160
it should be working as we as expected

01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,640
um so go back to the um codespace

01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,640
terminal

01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,240
there we go yeah scroll to the bottom of

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,240
that

01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,960
oh yeah it looks like we got some

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,599
success yeah folks are

01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
just like smash that star button yeah

01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,480
okay

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,680
it's working out we got two hundreds now

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,079
there we go so

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,280
everything was working uh we happened to

01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,960
be doing the wrong thing

01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,920
uh receiving the wrong type of input

01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,599
yeah it was the wrong point sorry people

01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,960
yeah and i think everybody else uh daryl

01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,400
like might even caught us

01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,559
quicker on the bad requesting

01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,319
yeah that's the daryl duck is the best

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,039
rubber duck that's for sure the best

01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:39,359
ramen duck

01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,200
um so now at this point we have the

01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:42,640
option to we can change the gift so like

01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,000
i think you were trying to change the

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,599
the b dougie gif

01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,520
at the moment the star gif we can change

01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,839
it to anything uh we would like

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,000
uh what i like to do is you can actually

01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,559
html here was it

01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,359
no it's actually uh in the gif js so the

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,160
html

01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:00,079
is just importing all these files with

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,799
all these javascript files

01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,359
and yeah it started doing a lot of the

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,359
sort of

01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:08,559
work for us um so on line 13

01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,839
actually we'll need to figure out which

01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,160
one is star so yeah this is an

01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:15,280
opportunity you've got your bay gift

01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,640
you're welcome pizza and then

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,160
yeah so this is it gives me an

01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,599
opportunity to explain this none of

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,319
those are the ones that we need to

01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,000
change

01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:27,200
but if you go down to these uh comfy

01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,559
commands uh we can go down to see

01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:35,599
which one is okay

01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:36,960
see command welcome yo flex pause

01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,960
yeah so those would be all the commands

01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,760
from the command line there should be a

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,950
um

01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,640
a star one gift

01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,920
[Music]

01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:52,000
use the give audio play

01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,240
function at the end

01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,960
you're welcome needs a welcome needs a

01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,960
pizza party

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,480
oh yeah it should be called starred i

01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,640
don't know if you can uh

01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,839
do a control find for start yeah so

01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,599
that's the one

01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:11,359
um where like we knew you would

01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,280
yeah so that's the text that shows up

01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:16,319
above the gif which is what we have

01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,880
done yeah so that's actually generating

01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,960
the title

01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,039
uh where this function or it's a sort of

01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,480
um object that's uh or this

01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,559
whatever you want to call it this

01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,960
hashtag is um grabbing the generate

01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,280
title

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,880
if you just do a fine for generate title

01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,520
uh we can find this did you hear that

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:34,559
something just went flex

01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,160
yeah so i do have a flex um a flex

01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,799
command too as well

01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,400
uh technically if you wanted to do some

01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:43,280
trickery you could go into my chat

01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,599
and make your chat make noises because

01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,079
my chat is still pointing to this

01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,400
this uh interaction is that where that's

01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,760
coming from

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,160
so maybe some folks know what they're

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,559
doing at the moment they know more than

01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,680
what i'm doing yeah so where that

01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,960
generate title is

01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,559
it's going to be probably next to the

01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,280
function or the gift that we're looking

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,920
for

01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,799
um and it's funny because i have this

01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,400
sitting right here

01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,480
next to me and i can just search just as

01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,000
well okay

01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,640
so i'm just laughing because everyone's

01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,039
just like keep doing flex in the chat

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,480
relax yeah so

01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,240
and this is the fun part about doing

01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,359
twitch interactions uh so what i'm

01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,720
looking forward to with the get up

01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:25,359
stream is actually having

01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,880
probably not as uh innocuous as saying

01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,079
flex and that's that's a punch

01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,599
we should have we need developers

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,720
developers developers that's what we

01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,480
need

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:35,039
yeah i mean that's the fun we can do

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,760
that really yeah um

01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,760
but we're real quick except line 72 is

01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,960
where we're trying to um

01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,920
73 is where we're trying to accomplish

01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,319
this

01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,319
okay guys stop drawing flex now please

01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,240
okay so do i need to put it in here do i

01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,280
so let's

01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,400
try doing um as i was saying a b doggie

01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,760
before this stream

01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,680
what we want to do is we want to pick

01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,799
out some of the ones that actually

01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,000
github gifts so we have lots of

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:08,000
octocat gifts and so what i thought was

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,799
we choose one of these

01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,240
and usually now i know these two for a

01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,160
fact have

01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,680
like transparent background so we're

01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,799
going to go for them so let's go copy

01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,200
link address

01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,960
and where do we put this in here uh we

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,880
could actually just replace the dollar

01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,520
gif

01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,559
yeah from dollar to that calibration

01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,319
right there yeah

01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,839
yeah we don't really need to abstract

01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,160
this into a um

01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,160
variable

01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,400
there we go

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,960
there we go oh the leaf blower

01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,280
if we save that if someone starts now

01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,680
we should get that gift coming up

01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,680
correct

01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,160
yes

01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,920
yeah so now the moment of truth is

01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:04,160
actually adding this to your obs

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:07,119
instead of instead of to your um

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,839
i guess the web browser that's easy

01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,480
enough to do so we can add this

01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:14,000
to um ovs so basically you go add a

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,839
browser source here i've never

01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,440
never done obs for so let's go github

01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:24,159
uh github alerts we're gonna call it

01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,279
we're okay that sounds good um so

01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:27,520
obviously now we've got a

01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,560
browser source on the screen as you can

01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,560
see there

01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,880
um so we're going to add that url in for

01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,199
the browser source

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,960
and then all we need to do is make the

01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,920
width depth we can change that if we

01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,679
want

01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,279
one thing i like to do with browser

01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,759
sources as well is click

01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,359
shut down source when not visible this

01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,839
means that when you are actually

01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,960
using obs and you change different

01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,560
scenes it's not running in the

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,359
background and therefore your obs won't

01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,880
crash

01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:57,279
hopefully ah now it just says sign into

01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,279
github

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,000
the browser says sign in to get off oh

01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,799
it's because it's ready for my code

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,400
space

01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:08,080
oh that's why okay how do we get yeah

01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,600
uh we'll have to clone this locally and

01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,600
do the same thing

01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,279
this is actually i've never actually got

01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,759
this far with the code space which makes

01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:14,880
sense

01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,640
because the code space is going to be

01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,000
running only when you have it up and

01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,000
running in a tab

01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,319
so i think the moment of truth is you

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,560
should actually just go ahead and clone

01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,560
uh locally uh you can do this with

01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:30,480
desktop if you wanted to

01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,319
yeah and then run it up desktop

01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,159
actually let's do the command line

01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:35,279
people know i like doing clones from the

01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:38,480
command line

01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,839
um so open up the terminal

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,400
this is what i'm doing yes yeah so

01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,679
gh should just tell you if you've got it

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,440
open

01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,319
now what you want to do is go to

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,839
wherever you usually put all your

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,880
local copies of your github so mine are

01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,679
all stored

01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,800
here so we go see and then we open that

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,040
location

01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,480
and it says gh3 proclone and you just

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,560
put the name of the repo in

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,840
here you don't need to put github.com

01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,880
because obviously it's assuming it's

01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,719
github

01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,880
um some pre-shots mish manners

01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,719
so we want to do obviously my ones let's

01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,960
just make sure

01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,960
we

01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,719
okay we've got the clone happening there

01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,239
and it's updating

01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,640
yeah and you probably want to do a tab

01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,000
in npm install the um

01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:40,640
smee client on here

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,920
yeah well actually the speed clients

01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,560
yeah you'll need to do it in here in

01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:47,760
this environment um

01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:50,880
yeah so npm install dash g

01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,880
smee dash client

01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,719
wasn't it it's me dash client dash d

01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,800
uh they both work oh they both work okay

01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,480
so install it now okay do we know about

01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,600
um dave claus got a question

01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,719
wsl um

01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,120
an ubuntu shell in wsl feels much more

01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,520
like home wsl is where it's at

01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,560
apparently

01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,560
world surf league

01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,840
sorry i'm just i'm just googling and

01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,120
that was the first the first hit

01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:30,159
um

01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:33,440
honestly i don't know i don't use it um

01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,920
for linux uh interesting well i'm not

01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,640
writing

01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,640
linux sorry

01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,679
or is it the yeah i don't even know

01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,159
subsystem for linux so is that actually

01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:47,280
having linux on your windows machine

01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:51,120
uh instead of using terminal

01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,120
that makes sense i mean i've used

01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,640
so in ubuntu you're actually putting

01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,480
ubuntu in the windows subset that will

01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,120
work because i usually have it on like a

01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,679
usb

01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,440
key then you just boot into ubuntu but

01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,239
then obviously you don't have access to

01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,239
okay anything else i've run linux in

01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,320
windows oh so you're actually running it

01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:12,080
in windows as opposed to what i usually

01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,640
do which is chuckling on usb and

01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,640
bootstrap

01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,679
almost natively that's really cool let's

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,679
have a look at it

01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,040
yeah i might try that out for my machine

01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,360
because like i have um

01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,159
i have a windows machine and i just

01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,679
don't really

01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,880
it doesn't feel right when i'm writing

01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:29,679
code because i spend way too much time

01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,080
on a mac

01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,280
but i am comfortable in linux and uh

01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,400
i've been wanting to

01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,159
have a linux uh a go-to linux machine

01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,760
uh at my fingertips and i haven't had

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,560
one in a long time

01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,320
yeah nice so it runs mostly natively but

01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,760
you can access windows files from linux

01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,360
start windows binaries and bash et

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,360
cetera et cetera et cetera and it's just

01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:53,679
amazing apparently

01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,520
yeah yeah it's good like as i said i

01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,120
used to use it um on a usb

01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,960
in which obviously you still get access

01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,120
to all your files then

01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,199
that was one of the ways i used to hack

01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:04,000
around getting people's files if they

01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,159
couldn't boot up

01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,760
windows you just like boot into ubuntu

01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,719
offer usb and then you have access to

01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,800
all their files

01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,159
copy and paste it over to a reinstall of

01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,520
windows and then they've all got their

01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:16,080
files

01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:18,080
at least it works so well all right so

01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:21,199
we've done this i've installed npm

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,840
what else should we do next then yeah so

01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,880
we want to

01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,920
run this me client um yeah go ahead and

01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,600
run the smee client

01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:33,040
uh smee smee dash you uh in the url

01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:36,239
and then that url from the webhook

01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,760
yeah your muscle memory is uh amazing

01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:40,880
you remember where everything is

01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,320
thank you i try to and then the next

01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,440
thing is uh you'll need to set up the

01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,719
webhook secret

01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,159
um again but that will be in your

01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,760
uh i guess you could do that desktop

01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,840
what you did in the cli so you'll have

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:55,120
to open up um

01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,080
uh desktop or vs code

01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,400
as it works yeah okay let's just do that

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,400
uh

01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,000
all right so i'll flick my screen back

01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,120
to us too while i'll do that so

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,400
basically

01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,800
i'll show everyone what i'm doing first

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,520
so what i like to do when i'm when i

01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,760
open

01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,199
and clone repos this is just the way

01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,960
i've started learning to work

01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:14,640
so here's my git tich right so this is

01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,600
the one we just cloned it's all here

01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,000
it's perfect

01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,080
it's nice um so what i usually do is

01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,840
open it up in vs code

01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:26,400
um so if i go to vs code uh

01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,880
bang i'll just close whatever last

01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:31,920
project i was working on

01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,760
uh actually it should be fine i'll just

01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,400
close the window make it easy

01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,320
um and then i'll just open up and then

01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,360
just dump the whole folder

01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,239
into vs code like that and then

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,800
everything's here

01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:46,159
so if i go to example it's here so i'm

01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,440
going to do what bw

01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,280
said before which means we're going to

01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,080
create a new file

01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,360
called env by itself and we're going to

01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,320
copy and paste this

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:57,280
webhook for those of you who can't see

01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,600
it

01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,199
it doesn't want to zoom in at the moment

01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,480
there we go oh it's huge

01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:07,920
that's way too so copy and paste that

01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,600
into the environment here

01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,199
and then i'm going to grab my secret so

01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,120
now you can chat to people while i go

01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:16,960
and grab my secret

01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:19,520
yeah and um i

01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,120
we so we haven't we haven't done a ton

01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,679
and the whole intention of this was like

01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,199
giving up

01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,760
us this opportunity to talk about the

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:28,880
api the web hooks code spaces

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,640
um what i love for folks to do is

01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,800
you've seen the readme needs a lot of

01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,480
help uh if you interested in sort of

01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,920
leveraging this for your twitch live

01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,360
stream um

01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,040
or if you want to just do a little

01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,880
practice live stream as well

01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,480
um you don't have to even go live you

01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,199
can just open up obs

01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,560
locally and then put the browser source

01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:49,040
in just like michigan

01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,480
and uh yeah always looking for feedback

01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,719
issues it's open source

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,159
so if you want to open up issue and talk

01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,040
about features you'd love to see in this

01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,640
thing

01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,920
that's the best way to sort of build

01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,360
things like that is actually getting

01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,880
feedback directly from

01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:05,950
you so yeah looking forward to it

01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,199
sounds good now i'm just trying to

01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:09,120
[Music]

01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,400
work out why it's not picked up the

01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,719
change

01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:14,080
so obviously i've saved that file when i

01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,560
copy it oh so the

01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,440
the emv is actually put into the git

01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,480
ignore

01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,960
so you can't actually save it um so your

01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:25,199
desktop won't show anything different

01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,560
okay and it's because it has a secret

01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,800
you don't want that secret to be

01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,480
exposed on github in open source repo

01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,159
makes sense

01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,960
which is why we had to do it manually

01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,920
again okay so that makes sense so that

01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,320
means it's already

01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,080
um automatically added back there or

01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,560
what happens there

01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,320
uh so every environment you have your

01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,920
repo set up you're gonna have to

01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,760
always add that environment variable

01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,320
back in now there are some tools you can

01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,360
use

01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,080
uh my stash that's dash um

01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,600
doppler is one that can provide your

01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,800
secrets in different environments and

01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,679
you don't have to continue to think

01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,880
about them

01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,400
um there's some other um i'm trying to

01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,120
think of the one that's um

01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,400
hashicorp they vault vault is another

01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,400
one so like that dot emv

01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,400
you could use volts and then you don't

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,280
have to remember to add your secret

01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,679
every time

01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,360
you clone a repo somewhere else uh it's

01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,880
kind of nice for like docker or

01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,320
other cloud environments um so

01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,840
none of that secret's there you should

01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,440
just be able to npm install which i

01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,800
think is one more step we didn't do

01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:31,440
and then npm start okay

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:33,840
um it's not working

01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,120
oh you got to open up a new tab yeah

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,120
because smee is running on this one

01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:43,120
also if anyone didn't realize i just

01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,960
totally showed my um

01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,120
my secret on screen so i've already

01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,520
changed it

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,560
okay i missed it but thanks for calling

01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,159
that out

01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,600
i've done it a few times i'm like oh

01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,640
whoops accidentally showed a password

01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,120
for that never

01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,159
but i say it after i've already changed

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,159
it because people are like

01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,600
oh wow quick screen shot of it's like

01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:03,360
not already changed

01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,760
sorry i say it after it's already

01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,480
changed this is this is me from having

01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,280
to code

01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,560
uh and like do passwords and stuff so

01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,280
many times

01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,320
i can literally just like yeah go oh

01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,400
bang change that

01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,920
oh sorry i just showed my password in

01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,280
screen

01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,600
yeah and did you know about the code

01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,400
period command 2 as well to open up vs

01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,400
code

01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,159
no what's that one so the command line

01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:30,000
you can run oh really

01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:33,199
code dot and then it opens up

01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,520
oh sweet thank you and it doesn't just

01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,400
open up vs code it opens up vs code with

01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,239
that folder

01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,520
yeah that's really cool i just noticed

01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,920
that i was like sweet ass

01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,280
it doesn't work in windows it did it

01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,440
just yeah it definitely

01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,120
definitely does it just i know it was a

01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,480
while before they made that native

01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,320
because before you had to like install a

01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,800
special plug-in okay there you go so

01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,280
it's been

01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,320
it was a while so daryl was probably

01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,400
right is it probably

01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,400
didn't used to work in um

01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,920
yeah it used to not work by default uh

01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,159
it had to be yet

01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,080
install other people's random scripts

01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:08,719
and code to make it work and now

01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:10,239
vs code makes it work natively the

01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,880
daryl's also saying my memory is

01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,560
impeccable thank you so much

01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,159
okay yeah it opens the current which is

01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,560
really cool all right so we're back here

01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,000
again

01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:22,480
so we've done npm installed pm install

01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,480
it's not npm start and we're back to

01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,679
another version of this running

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:29,360
cool and then we should be able to

01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,080
and just kidding looks like there's an

01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,760
error actually uh

01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,840
oh are you in the right fold are you in

01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,840

yeah so we have the npm install here um

01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,920
i don't think we were here

01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:11,199
when we npm installed uh interesting

01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,199
i can go back yes

01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,360

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,280

yeah and that's what the error message

01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,800
is it's saying that there's no uh local

01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,239
host running

01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:37,280
cool and then npm start

01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:39,280
yep hey

01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,840
it's working excellent started on port

01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,280
3000 so

01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,080
that's local port 3000 yeah so this is

01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,560
local port

01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,239
so what code spaces was doing was local

01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:53,440
was doing local port 3000

01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:55,120
for the code space and cloud environment

01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,760
doesn't that usually give you a url you

01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,560
can go straight to

01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,560
uh literally

01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,880
yeah oh sorry this is the code i wrote

01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,800
so

01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:09,600
normally like for react and view apps

01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:12,560
they'll give you a url in the browser

01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,120
i don't print that properly in there

01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,800
which is

01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,880
again open source for the wind if you

01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,520
want to make that a better

01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,360
a better uh message okay is that it

01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,679
localhost 3000

01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,199
yep so this is this is it working uh the

01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,400
one thing is you can note that we

01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:29,600
haven't committed

01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,719
the change with the dap

01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:36,960
puncta cat um so that would

01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:38,800
be mvs code that will that's all in code

01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,360
spaces so

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,159
oh actually i actually don't know how to

01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:45,679
commit stuff from crowspaces

01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,199
uh you can actually you can commit it

01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:50,000
from the command line if you'd like

01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,199
uh so like git add git commit uh you

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,520
could also use github

01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:55,280
cli too as well uh sorry this terminal

01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,120
was running that one's running the other

01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,239
stuff oops sorry

01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,080
yeah you can in this in the server or

01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,280
we we've got scary with tabs but yeah we

01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,480
can get ad

01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,480
period yeah

01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,760
sorry and then i'll grab everything that

01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:13,360
we've done

01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:17,760
yep and then get get um

01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:21,199
and then do we want a message uh yes

01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:25,199
we did it stuff from osf

01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:27,760
we did it okay

01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,880
two files changed four deletions

01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,719
insertions

01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:35,280
and then is that it

01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,920
yep yeah so we did do this on the main

01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,520
branch

01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,600
um i don't know if that's to be a

01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,800
problem if you'd make any other future

01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,760
readme changes

01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,560
um but i think it's fine if you merge

01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,040
your stuff

01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,560
into the upstream it's not a big deal i

01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,199
don't need to do anything else or is

01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,679
that good

01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,800
no you'll need to get push oh sorry yes

01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,560
that's right

01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,080
yeah and you can also use vs code

01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,199
plugins to do all this too

01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:01,600
i've rejected it um

01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:02,719
is it rejected why is it rejected the

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,000
remote contains

01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,360
work that you do not have locally oh

01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,320
that's that is true so you probably want

01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,159
to do a branch

01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,920
it's because you made some readme so you

01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:15,120
have to do either get pool

01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,760
oh okay uh probably yeah pull in those

01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,440
changes

01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,320
this is why i like desktop because it

01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:23,440
works it out for you

01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:25,120
yeah and now so now we have a merge

01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,159
of that branch waiting for editor to

01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:30,719
close the file so i close it in

01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:33,280
no it's uh it's it's so go back to where

01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,280
you just were

01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,040
oh did you just close that okay so see

01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,960
above there you had um

01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,639
this is creating a commit commit message

01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,040
for you um

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,080
you might close out this um search for

01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,600
star

01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,120
uh this is basically creating a merge

01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:50,480
commit for you okay

01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:53,520
um and

01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,239
at this point i think this is uh is this

01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,000
bim

01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:02,480
can you hit a shift uh semicolon

01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:06,800
to get the i guess colon

01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,800
all right no actually up on the top

01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:16,159
what was that so up here yes there

01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:18,000
yeah so hit colon wq

01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,920
that's actually not even doing it

01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,280
interesting so yeah i have actually no

01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,199
idea how to do this in

01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,400
vs code because this is not vim this is

01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,000
uh

01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,719
this is trying to save your commit

01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,600
message actually curious of chat y'all

01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,239
familiar with how to do some vs code so

01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,880
this is

01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,840
so obviously if anyone doesn't know

01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,840
codespaces

01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,760
runs via vs code so

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,840
that's why oh you get to save and close

01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,679
the window that's all you have to do

01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,040
sorry in them it's way more complicated

01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,239
so i'm like

01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,800
i'm trying to make you do something you

01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,800
don't need to do

01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,320
there we go oh yeah you're just trying

01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,600
to be too tricky

01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:59,760
yeah i just i have so much muscle memory

01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,679
so like even atomic schools is uh

01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,120
he's got my command i was trying to run

01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,400
okay command wq

01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:07,679
or colon wq but just saving the file is

01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,480
actually all you need to do

01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,320
okay so we just literally go in here and

01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:15,920
just save

01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,600
uh i think you already did it

01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,840
where what happened to the commit

01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,600
message

01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,920
it says waiting for editor to close the

01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,920
file

01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:29,520
let it go uh you should be closed a file

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:32,239
called merge message

01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,760
merge message it's up it should be up on

01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:35,760
the top in your tabs

01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,120
yeah so you should save this file and

01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,000
then close it

01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,920
that's it oh yeah it does literally all

01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,040
it does oh that's hilarious i did not

01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,520
know that

01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,199
yeah so this confused me as well uh

01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,000
because normally i do this with the

01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:51,199
vim on the command line but in vs code

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,800
just saving the file

01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,159
you could edit the message to something

01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,840
else if you wanted to that's what they

01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,840
were giving you an option for

01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,960
uh but just by closing it after saving

01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,199
it it just

01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,960
proceeded with doing the commit so if

01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:06,400
you actually go to git log

01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:08,239
um type in git space log

01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,520
you can see that last message that's the

01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:11,520
message up on top

01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,120
that we were editing uh we didn't do

01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,000
anything there but that's where they're

01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:20,080
giving your chance to change merge main

01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:25,199
of mish banners get twitch

01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:25,199
cool now what now this local host is

01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,239
uh you need to actually push that back

01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:35,040
to github how do we do that

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:39,120
we go back to that's the one i did right

01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,120
yeah let's see the uh the vs code space

01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,600
and there we go i don't know why i keep

01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,800
showing up okay like i can't like

01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,480
delania like

01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:53,440
why do you keep showing up that's right

01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,440
we'll fix it again

01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,960
there we go i created a name i think the

01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,159
when you did the commit message once we

01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,360
figured how to close it you'll need to

01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,639
push that back up to

01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,400
um push it back up to github so that way

01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,719
in the command line you could clone that

01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:11,360
or

01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:13,760
so you could pull it okay so

01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,880
miss manage is a serial clicker i'm

01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,239
sorry i

01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:20,239
literally have a serial clicker it's so

01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,120
funny who like just just slow down i'm

01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,679
like okay sorry

01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,639
hands off the keyboard not doing it

01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,080
right okay yeah

01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,239
we have been doing a lot of dancing

01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,080
between different tabs we have made

01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:32,080
haven't we

01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,280
like the incident replay is literally

01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,120
what dave cord has played

01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,960
would be dougie is like yeah wait no go

01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,000
back hold on one yeah just

01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:43,199
do that okay

01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,040
okay so so now we're back to vs code

01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,320
did we push that back up to github we

01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:49,199
haven't so

01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,880
if i go to desktop there is no changes

01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:53,760
because the only changes we made in vs

01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:56,239
code was the secret

01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,920
no so this is the we made a change to

01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:01,360
the the gif

01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,800
in that was in code spaces

01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,239
yeah so we never got to the point where

01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:08,960
we pushed this commit the merged branch

01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:10,400
we need to actually push that back up to

01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,440
github

01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:15,760
so you should just under here we made

01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,159
the change down here yeah there we go

01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,440
so now what do we do yeah we go so in

01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:22,960
the command line you just

01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:25,199
just do get push i think we need a new

01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,199
one

01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:30,960
technically didn't need to do one but no

01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:33,840
it just that one was funny

01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,120
uh that one was stuck in git log we had

01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,040
looked at the log and then we just had

01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,960
to exit out of that but

01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,719
it it is what it is um so on the

01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,840
terminal we'll need to get pool

01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:44,480
um locally okay so now we're done we're

01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,040
done with

01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,760
oh sorry not here um we're done with vs

01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,440
code

01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,440
oh sorry with code space yeah like it's

01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,719
already up today okay so this time we

01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,800
need to do

01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,560
yes so we basically pushed a change so

01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,840
now we can sort of have access to it so

01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,679
i need to open up a new one because

01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:04,080
someone's still vlogging right

01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:07,120
yeah okay so i need to

01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:11,840
open up my file again

01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,840
i'm assuming

01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:28,400
now we'll see the def no the um

01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,120
daft puncta cat should be now in our

01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,239
browser now

01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,199
in the local so that was all saving one

01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,800
copy and paste

01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:37,199
um committing all that and pulling it

01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:40,400
down because we only made the one change

01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:41,679
not working uh

01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,440
just check your server to see if there's

01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:48,000
an error message

01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:50,239
uh which is this tab um

01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,440
there's a yeah that one that's an error

01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:53,840
message

01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,040
um which i don't know what it is does

01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,719
not match event

01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,320
payload oh that's because your secret

01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,679
changed yes

01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,679
so you showed your secret and then you

01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,920
updated it yeah so you'll need to

01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:05,360
restart the server oh we need to restart

01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,639
the server every time you do that okay

01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:12,960
so i just kill this one then uh

01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:16,320
you can take uh command c yeah

01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:20,080
yeah yeah yeah okay so then just npm

01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:22,480
npm start and restart it

01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:24,239
uh yes cool okay i didn't know you had

01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,719
to restart the server okay that's still

01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,719
not working

01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,400
um it might be your invite you so you

01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,960
i've already

01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,960
updated it yep so you updated it

01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,360
we're talking i keep calling it

01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,960
codespace and vs code

01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,880
trying to distinguish between what's in

01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,280
the cloud and what's locally

01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,920
on your environment uh i'm not sure

01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:48,800
which one

01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,760
had updated they're both updated both vs

01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,239
code local

01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,520
and code spaces are both have the new

01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,280
okay

01:30:53,520 --> 01:31:02,000
um the new one but i don't know why

01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:04,639
maybe it just hasn't gone through

01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,639
that's how it look

01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,400
uh maybe restart the smead too as well

01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,960
because that's actually talking to your

01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:12,719
web hook

01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:15,040
okay so you kill this one as well

01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:17,840
yep yeah let's go ahead and hit up and

01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,840
restart that one

01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:26,320
okay connected and then check your uh

01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,840
local host that's interesting

01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:30,880
yeah it's definitely that error message

01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,880
is about your secret

01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,040
we changed the secret so many times now

01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,639
we're

01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,520
okay but it's the same on everything

01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:47,199
well it should be the same on everything

01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,199
except is it the same

01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:53,040
i could what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna

01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,239
check this is how i check i'm like i

01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,679
don't that's the thing i don't know if

01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,520
it's updated in github

01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,719
so i'm literally going to the repo and

01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,719
seeing what the secret is

01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:09,360
on the repo itself yeah locally

01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:09,360
i'm going no no this is on github itself

01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:17,199
okay so github doesn't actually have it

01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,840
oh like my my branch of github if we

01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,360
have a look

01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,440
here's my branch of github it doesn't

01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:24,000
even have that environment

01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:25,760
so that's because the dot get ignored is

01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,600
ignoring that environment variable

01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,880
yes because you don't want to do that so

01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,199
how do we so we don't want that

01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,719
we don't want that secret on github.com

01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,480
that is true so how do we

01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,000
check to see if it's actually there do

01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,920
we just like push it back again just

01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,480
double check

01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,040
um pushing is not gonna do anything we

01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,239
actually

01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,960
that's where i was sort of talking with

01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:46,960
the vaults in the hashicorp

01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,080
store to be able to keep it consistent

01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,600
we don't have that

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,520
so we literally just need to copy and

01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,480
paste it

01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:56,239
just on your vs code locally that's what

01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,920
i did

01:32:56,239 --> 01:33:00,239
and they're all the same they're all the

01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:03,010
same

01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:04,639
so i have no idea

01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:07,600
[Laughter]

01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,960
what's going on and that's that's the

01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,920
beauty of coding

01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,880
yeah i know sometimes i'm 100 confident

01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,080
that the error message

01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,760
is because of secret um so

01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,760
i would just say let's just make your

01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,239
secret secret for now

01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:23,520
uh and just copy and paste that secret

01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:26,000
everywhere

01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,040
into two places there's only two places

01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,040
where it should be right

01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:37,840
in vs code and on

01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:37,840
yeah it's it's it's the same thing

01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,239
uh change it to something new now let's

01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,199
see if i just did

01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:46,320
oh did you save the file sorry i was

01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:50,239
just looking at the chat

01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:52,400
oh my gosh i did save the file it's got

01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,360
to be a user error i don't mind you just

01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,679
save them

01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,679

01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,400
i've done everything

01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:08,480
unfortunately this is uh all in your

01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,600
hands at this point

01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:14,960
i saved everything so i've saved the n

01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:18,400
dot emv file in codespaces

01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,400
i've saved the emv file in

01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,639
so can you do me a favor can you open up

01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:26,239
your um

01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,840
open up the your github repo

01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,000
change the github repos secret the

01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,800
secret and we'll just manually just make

01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,440
it secret

01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,280

this on screen but oh that wasn't it oh

01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,600

01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,080
figured it out

01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:52,320
don't forget when you say yeah when you

01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,520
do something it's not about hitting save

01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,159
on the things

01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,520
you've got to scroll all the way down to

01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:02,080
the web hook and click

01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:04,000
update so don't forget that

01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,119
okay yeah that was that was awesome we

01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,880
got that on

01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:10,080
on camera because that should definitely

01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,000
be in the readme

01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,080
okay we'll change that to we'll change

01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,719
that in the review this time

01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,280
i like it okay so basically yeah change

01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:19,950
your

01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:21,520
secret whatever it is and then

01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:24,080
[Music]

01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,719
yeah and then copy paste it onto

01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,280
everything

01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,239
scroll all the way down update your

01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,719
webhook

01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:32,800
go to your environment save that there

01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:36,080
go back to your code space

01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:39,360
save it there as well and then

01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,800
you should be good you're ready yes

01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,639
and now we now we get to the point where

01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:47,440
we can update the browser source

01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:47,440
cool so now we should be able to

01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,159
we actually have to restart everything

01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,080
don't we so we have to go back here and

01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:57,119
we have to

01:36:54,080 --> 01:37:00,639
uh kill this one

01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,560
yeah i think that what one was was good

01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,840
yeah once it started yeah but we'll need

01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,960
to start it anyway because it

01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,119
did kill it so this one we go down

01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,119
to

01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,560
command c yeah i'm doing it

01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:22,719
there we go it's that one

01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:25,199
there we go so npm start yep

01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:27,920
cool start it there uh so we need to

01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:31,760
restart smee here so we can go up

01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:34,960
tab and re do that yep

01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:37,440
yep service started

01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,440
didn't work

01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,360
why did it not work wait it's it's still

01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:46,400
running

01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:48,239
um yeah we just need to uh oh yeah it's

01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,760
still going sorry okay

01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:52,400
is this me you're still building it's

01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,239
okay guys this is just still going

01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,760
yeah so you gotta you need to get a 200

01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:57,679
so it looks like someone did

01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,119
start it i'm like struggling to find

01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:03,840
your uh your repo

01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:03,840
it's not handy for this

01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:16,560
oh yeah look at that um go back there

01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:18,480
was an error message

01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:20,800
yeah you scrolled right by it uh the

01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:22,960
other tab

01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,880
no actually that that looks fine that

01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,880
was us pushing the changes

01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:34,159
so i'm getting the star event and we're

01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:37,360
getting the server running

01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,360
we're just not getting

01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:47,119
oh my gosh just in the building

01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:48,239
uh probably just going to open up the

01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,679
chrome console

01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:53,199
because right now this is a black box

01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,199
for us um yeah

01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,040
that is extremely small so you'll have

01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,920
to help me out on that one

01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,719
it's tiny dev tools failed to load

01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,480
source map

01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,040
could not load content for chrome

01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,040
extension

01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:13,440
websocket connection to wss

01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,520
socket this is actually legitimate so

01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,760
remember when we first did the ws

01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,159
change in the public index to html oh we

01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:23,040
didn't change it on the local one

01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:24,400
so localhost is not ssl encrypted so

01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:28,000
we'll need to actually

01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:30,000
make that back to ws instead of wss

01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,600
okay so this is the i should probably we

01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,360
should prob well we don't need to do

01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,920
this but i'll need to actually create a

01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,199
flag

01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:38,560
for when it's localhost to um to not do

01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,960
that check

01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,960
yeah go to

01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,480
i'll need to do like some conditional to

01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,800
check to see if it's

01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,719
encrypted or not okay cool again this is

01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:03,920
not great code this is

01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:06,239
code network it's good code yeah

01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,840
okay so we've done that now we need to

01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,280
do we need to make an energy if i go to

01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,320
desktop there's probably a change to

01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:13,840
make okay so let's

01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:17,440
update index uh

01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,440
fixed encryption

01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:23,360
and then we commit to main yeah and at

01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,320
this point we'll have a browser source

01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:27,280
that we can

01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,280
that will work okay

01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:37,840
we're getting there fable all right

01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:37,840
so then if we go back to here yeah

01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,080
i hope everybody learned something now

01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:47,760
it should if i

01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:49,760
okay somebody somebody star it

01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,360
somebody start right now it looks like

01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:55,040
daryl is actually saying

01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,400
this oh yeah

01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,560
why would you need to sign the github

01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,040
that's the actually change the browser

01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,600
source

01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:04,400
i will properties um i think this is

01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,400
still pointing to

01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:09,279
[Music]

01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,840
and i think it runs about like 10

01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,840
seconds it does

01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:33,840
let's get x

01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:33,840
yay we have it uh how do we change the

01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,040
that would be in the index html

01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,800
there so index.html here we go

01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,119
yeah how do we get rid of that flex

01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,119
command

01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:58,719
so which one do you want to do first

01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:58,719
let's actually think of both in the same

01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:01,840
place

01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:11,280
yep uh line 33 is where the gif alerts

01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,280
happen

01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,280
so you just remove the mp3

01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,199
yeah but i don't think the pew audio was

01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:25,040
the one that was for yo

01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:25,040
um you'll need to go

01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,080
we could actually just get rid of it um

01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,480
i'll just

01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:34,320
it's actually this is not the place to

01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,280
do it it's actually gonna be below sorry

01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:39,440
i i didn't mean to say

01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:41,119
line 33. um so uncomment that

01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,560
so this is for the chat commands this is

01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:44,639
extra code that we're not actually oh

01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,880
okay this is like check commands

01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,400
this is uh the actual star that happens

01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,119
is further down

01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,719
further down okay yeah it's gonna be

01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:55,360
audio play

01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:57,600
yes that's all you have to do there we

01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,920
go so

01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,040
uh okay we'll push that into actually

01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:05,360
yeah and then you could also

01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:05,360
remove the audio uh mp3 as well

01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,520
it doesn't oh actually i haven't pushed

01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:10,800
it yet though

01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,400
yeah and sometimes with the browser

01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,840
sources you have to manually refresh

01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,679
them too as well

01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,119
yeah yeah that's actually me saying flex

01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:20,239
too as well

01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:22,840
really that does not sound like you

01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:24,560
yeah it's uh got some processing

01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:28,239
happening

01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:30,719
it's still happening yeah so online

01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,600
go back to the um that function on line

01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,760
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,719
just remove replace audio with

01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:39,840
underscore

01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:42,239
and then that will be fine

01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,080
actually even better it's where the

01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:46,159
audio is um

01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,920
sorry i can't see behind the uh i know

01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:53,840
behind the thing let's remove the lights

01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:53,840
at the moment there we go

01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,760
yeah i thought the audio play would have

01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,119
been it i think it's

01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,080
at this point you just it's probably

01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:06,719
because there's a tab open with it open

01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:06,719
oh because i've got the local one yeah

01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:12,000
because it should be the same thing

01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:13,840
playing off that as and playing off the

01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,119
well what's what's going to happen is

01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,520
the obs

01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:20,080
is running the local one then you have

01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,440
one that's running with the vs code and

01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,960
it's going to run three times

01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,560
because every time you have it open it's

01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:27,920
just going to run but i'm only

01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:30,480
i'm only running the local host and the

01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,880
local host is pointing direct to obs

01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,560
that's why it's going up twice but i've

01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,400
updated it now so it means it shouldn't

01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,080
be going off at all

01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,320
and with the browser sources you'll have

01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:42,639
to refresh the cache

01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,719
um with obs like normally with cache and

01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:47,920
validation in the browser

01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:49,840
um it happens automatically when chrome

01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,840
in obs you have to manually do it so if

01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:55,040
you made a change to localhost

01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,159
that's not going to update in obs okay

01:44:55,040 --> 01:45:00,000
that makes sense

01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:00,480
i think so in the browser source on the

01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,800
bottom

01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,679
uh if you open up the browser source in

01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,600
obs

01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,280
uh on the bottom of that browser source

01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,159
there's a refresh cache yeah i did that

01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,719
one

01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:11,280
all right did you okay yep way ahead

01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,719
yeah

01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,639
worst comes to worse you can just go

01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,320
ahead and just remove all the audio mp3s

01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,000
at the top of the file that's all right

01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:20,320
we'll just save that and make sure

01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:24,080
that's all good

01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:24,080
remove flex

01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,639
push and then what was yellow we wanted

01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,719
to change the color of the

01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:33,360
the fonts as well and change the type

01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:37,040
yeah so where was that

01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:38,719
index line 782 so yeah there's no css

01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,600
templates so the way i would just do

01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,800
this is um

01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:44,639
on line 72 before the

01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,639
actually it looks like there's css here

01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,400
uh maybe i misspoke

01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,679
yeah so the text shadows that are

01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:52,320
happening there

01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,560
is there um i feel like i should know

01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:58,159
this because i wrote this code

01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:00,560
um there's an index.css

01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:01,600
and there's one called text shadows yep

01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,719
there it is

01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:08,480
text uh so line 30. uh you could do

01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:11,440
font color yeah i think it's actually uh

01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,440
not font color it's a

01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:30,960
there's color sandstones

01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,960
whoa did a whole lot of them

01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:38,880
okay um font wait let's make that a bit

01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:41,840
bigger so you can actually see it

01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,840
um

01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,000
could use the american don't we want

01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,480
color

01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:55,840
uh it's actually line 40 uh actually you

01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,840
already have already

01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:02,800
why is it that it's definitely not red

01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:04,880
oh yeah you're right perhaps the uh it

01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:09,840
should be fun color instead

01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:09,840
maybe you're on the right track

01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:25,360
color yeah font color is not existing it

01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:28,080
it should be color

01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,840
that's what i thought yeah it looks like

01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,840
the um

01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,119
it looks like this um css is actually

01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,000
not being oh you know what maybe it's

01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:37,199
not included in the

01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,159
index.html just color that's well that's

01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,840
what we had before

01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,119
but obviously that wasn't working

01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,840
because it was like red yeah you know

01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:44,880
what it is

01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:46,639
it's because the um uh if you went to

01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,080
the index.html we're not including the

01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:51,280
style sheets

01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:52,560
oh okay so we are on line four we're

01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,360
including the

01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,239
uh javascript online right there yeah

01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,760
but we're not actually

01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:59,679
creating the css so we'll need to

01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:03,679
actually create a style tag

01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:05,600
that it includes the index.css

01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,360
how do we do that again i know we're

01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,080
doing it it's actually line three

01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,400
oh it says stylus css that's why it

01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:15,040
should be index css

01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,920
again this is not a great code it's code

01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:19,119
that works

01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:22,800
okay let's um let's go leave that

01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:24,560
red or whatever you had it and

01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,639
save that yeah so this is actually doing

01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,920
a bit of yeah it's actually doing some

01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,719
animation too as well

01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,000
so i did all this work and i realized um

01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:33,840
you're not actually showing any

01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,760
of it all yeah i wasn't showing it at

01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,960
all uh because the the file name was

01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:41,360
completely different

01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:43,040
okay pushed origin the commodore 64 had

01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:48,239
16 colors

01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:48,239
and all right okay

01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:02,000
is that that's not showing it is it

01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:03,199
uh you have to refresh the browser

01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,159
source again

01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:08,719
um due to the change that you just did

01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,719
doubles

01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:14,560
uh yeah it's not it doesn't look like it

01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:18,560
yeah it just seems like the

01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:22,400
the css and um obs is not picking up

01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,400
um which should not be the case

01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:29,199
so text shadows is there

01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,639
index.html sorry that's that red line

01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:32,960
why is that red line there it's really

01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:36,480
annoying me

01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:38,560
why is it red dump all the new tech and

01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:42,080
go back to dialogue

01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:46,080
uh okay so you got your dad

01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,080
yeah text index

01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:52,000
i think there is something broken

01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:56,080
but you know what i don't know how

01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:59,599
necessary it is to debug

01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:01,920
some of my broken code

01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,520
should definitely just open an issue yes

01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,840
i i will open an issue

01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,840
code is broken css not working

01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,320
yeah it's interesting but usually in

01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,920
these uh

01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,760
these little explorations i never get

01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,040
this far when it comes to usually we get

01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,800
the thing on the screen

01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:20,159
and uh then that we were sort of running

01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,080
out of time but we've we've

01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,520
it's good i think we got i think we got

01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,560
pretty far on

01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:29,280
everything yeah so like

01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,760
i guess to recap we basically were able

01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:33,440
to get

01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:36,480
the the the browser source working

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,040
in obs so that was a win uh i didn't

01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,119
expect

01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,560
the css uh to kind of throw us for a

01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:42,960
loop but i think that ul

01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,400
tag it is broken um it should not

01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,400
actually be written that way

01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,440
uh so you definitely found another bug

01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,440
um for me

01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,880
it should be yeah i don't think you also

01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:54,320
are self-closing tags

01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,440
um so that might be affecting things

01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:59,760
the css name is also affecting things

01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:02,080
um but the good news is we have a web

01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,480
hook that talks to a github repo

01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:05,199
and every time someone starts a repo it

01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:09,280
works

01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:10,960
uh also keep in mind ssl

01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,679
it you need to have it working for code

01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:16,880
spaces but it does not need to work for

01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:20,000
um localhost and i think the

01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,760
ssl is on line the extra

01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,440
yeah the line 13 of the public of the

01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,760
index.html

01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,880
that's just a little trickery that um

01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,599
and

01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,239
daryl duck is it yeah daryl black

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,639
mentioned

01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:35,040
we should definitely have some sort of

01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,440
flag to check for local host and only

01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,880
use

01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:40,320
ssl for when we need it yeah um

01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,000
and i'll put in the username before it

01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,480
started the repo text oh

01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,920
you know what it's meant to yeah that 15

01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:47,199
you called that up too as well it wasn't

01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,840
actually doing the username

01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:52,000
uh no it wasn't it was just saying

01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:55,199
somebody started

01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,520
just saying so how do we how would we

01:51:55,199 --> 01:52:00,880
fix that what where would that be

01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,480
uh well if you go to the um uh the

01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,679
giftjs

01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:06,480
yeah actually it's not even it's the

01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:07,520
index.js and the the main repo

01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,000
that's where we're actually getting the

01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:14,320
username ah right right

01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,760
okay so which is funny

01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,960
well i don't know how funny this is but

01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:19,360
i was actually getting this to work

01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:22,320
locally uh before we got online

01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:23,840
uh which is very confusing but it says

01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:26,960
um

01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,960
should say server actually

01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:32,239
also got how you can always say doc type

01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:36,000
is missing from the index or not

01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:39,920
uh that's all inferred at this point um

01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,040
that um most modern web tools will infer

01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,880
that so you don't actually have to type

01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:46,000
that anymore

01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:48,880
or include it so where's

01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,880
the name

01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,599
so it should say yeah it says receive

01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,440
message

01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,800
and then the message should be created

01:52:55,440 --> 01:53:00,159
above there so

01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:03,520
if you go to the top where message

01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:03,520
is message defined up there

01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:06,560
now

01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,840
console output is where it should be

01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,840
right or not

01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:25,599
uh so i don't think the payload changed

01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:27,440
but uh if you went to smee um

01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,360
perhaps the way we're receiving it has

01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:32,560
changed since

01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,560
well that's weird because it

01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,080
it wouldn't have changed

01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,800
it wouldn't have between the time we

01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,280
went live when it was working on my

01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,760
machine

01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,560
to the time where you forked it and then

01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,320
ran it

01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,320
uh i don't know what what happened since

01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:50,080
then uh because i am definitely looking

01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:53,760
at my console logs

01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:55,679
and seeing so and so

01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:58,000
it says so and so far uh started the

01:53:55,679 --> 01:54:02,639
repo

01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,840
so it's not to do with this wss is it

01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:06,800
no that should be because www which is

01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,000
confusing

01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,920
uh because the way we're doing it in

01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,480
index.js html this is actually what's

01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,840
defined

01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:19,199
in here with the web hooks and that's to

01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,199
find earlier above line six i believe

01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:26,239
but regardless i would call this a win

01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,599
ah yeah i think it's a bit of a win i

01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:30,639
mean this gif is

01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,639
a win look at that

01:54:31,679 --> 01:54:34,960
yeah that's that's what happens when the

01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,920
uh the flex happens

01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,639
um so if you were actually tried that in

01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,400
my chat that's

01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:42,960
that's the image because yeah before

01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,320
obviously

01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,960
we weren't getting the gift we were just

01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:50,239
getting the look

01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,400
yeah yeah

01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:54,480
i like it but yeah i think i think it's

01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:57,520
definitely a win so um

01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:58,960
yeah if anyone is keen to um either give

01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:02,320
it a go yourself

01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:05,599
or jump on the chat

01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:09,920
or um if you would like to even

01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:12,480
um do some updates or update the readme

01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:14,480
or anything like that um we added the

01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:15,920
link there so i'll add it back in here

01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,840
again

01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:20,239
so there you go so we've got b palmer

01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:29,199
enjoy the rest of the stream we're about

01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,560
to

01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,440
um wrap up now anyway so again thanks

01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,800
everyone

01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:37,599
i'll watch your twitter well there's b

01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:40,960

on twitch um or obviously you can follow

01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,080
me as well but obviously

01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:50,560
b doggie has way cooler coding content

01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:52,400
because you can code better than i can

01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:54,960
clearly i don't know if i proved it

01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:56,960
though i definitely i'm still like what

01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:08,639
um as we mentioned in our last

01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,560
open source friday stream when we did

01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:13,440
the github game off stuff

01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,119
we now are opening up our forums after

01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:17,679
each stream

01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:18,800
so if you feel like connecting with

01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:21,440
people here

01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,800
um you want to chat to b doggy or myself

01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,480
as well

01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,639
we're going to open up these forums as a

01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,360
way to talk to people afterwards so if

01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:29,920
we have a

01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,280
quick look on stream um so you attended

01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,000
the event let's talk

01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:35,280
um and have a chat so obviously we are

01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:37,520
only just going live now

01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,560
so you can check it out feel free to put

01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:42,159
some stuff in there

01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,639
the community team may even decide to do

01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:46,239
cool badges or open source friday badges

01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:47,679
so people who jumped in on the game off

01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:49,840
stream last week

01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,639
um anyone who commented on the forum got

01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:55,040
a special game off badge

01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,639
b-doggy you also have a staff badge so

01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:57,840
you can look all official when you jump

01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,520
into these phones

01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,880
excellent but we thought this would be a

01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,800
good way so the other thing we're going

01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,880
to do too with these is

01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,880
at the end of the stream i'll go through

01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,320
and put in all the links that we spoke

01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,199
about as well

01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,560
because obviously the twitch vod doesn't

01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:14,960
stay around forever

01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,000
and the links in the chat won't stay

01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,159
around forever

01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,119
uh but this url will so we'll put in all

01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:22,159
the links

01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:24,000
for sme for the repo for the octodax if

01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:25,040
you want really cool gifts that you feel

01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,360
like using

01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,639
i will also put in the link in there for

01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:33,119
b doggies

01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:33,119
as well so how does that sound

01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:38,639
that sounds good to me not sure if

01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:41,119
you're waiting for the chat to uh

01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:43,280
respond back though yeah both well it's

01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:45,679
it's all in a slight delay don't forget

01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:47,679
see daryl's saying good work guys thank

01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:48,800

01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:51,520
really fun

01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,639
um yeah i i actually totally want to do

01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,440
this again

01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:57,840
um but if you yeah i would say that if

01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,840
folks have any if go into the um

01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,920
the the forums open up issues if you

01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:05,119
have any ideas for what we should build

01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,000
on stream or in basically improve to get

01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:08,719

01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:12,719
and uh kind of get that stuff sort of

01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:15,840
keyed away

01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:18,000
and start integrating stuff and even uh

01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,960
mish's twitch channel as well it'd be

01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,599
cool to get one of my

01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,480

01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:24,800

01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:30,000
open source friday streams before

01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:31,760
we often have maintainers and people on

01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,599
the stream to have a chat

01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:37,679
and talk and have some fun now
