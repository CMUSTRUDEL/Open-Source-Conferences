perhaps I guess one of his little

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,440
exercise if we grabbed an issue

00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,340
could you talk out loud like how you

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,920
would approach it

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,560
perhaps in like maybe give someone like

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,380
sort of a underhand pitch yeah so

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,029
perhaps maybe I'm not sure I'm not sure

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,439
yeah okay so the first one was a pretty

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,689
good one to walk through because it's

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,110
like adding a new functionality to the

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,540
create next step okay absolutely so in

00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,289
this case this person created a bug

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,160
report being like hey I went to

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:44,010
basically send - E or - this example to

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,620
create next step with the value of

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:53,309
default to basically pick out the

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,989
default example right so previously like

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,370
what we did and like older versions of

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,530
next was like we just gave you the

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,539
default example but now we basically ask

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,190
you like hey do you want to install this

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,840
example or what do you want to use the

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,330
default value and this is where like

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,200
this broke basically for his use guys

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:17,340
because you wanted to use like dissing

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,150
CI or something like that so it should

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,610
basically I just select default when you

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,460
do - e default so I basically like

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:32,040
bypassing that check for hey do you want

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:35,310
to create a example do you want to use

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,590
an example yeah so basically I replied

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,430
like hey we'd be happy to like add this

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:46,500
functionality - e - e default so someone

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,100
already created forecast for this yeah

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,240
this is actually yeah so this is like

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,130
some like contributor that is pretty

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,120
active on the projects and that tries to

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,770
help out a good first issues given that

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,020
we don't have that much time it actually

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,369
might make sense to like go into this

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:11,190
like for requests cuz it basically shows

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,689
like which changes were made to make

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,210
this happen and it wasn't made by me

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:23,420
right so yeah if you go into the dev you

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:27,120
basically because it's only one file so

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,250
create next up is that package right

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
that is just great next up yeah that has

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,280
an index OTS which is the create next

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:41,160
step command and then what it does is

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:44,040
basically it checks is like example is

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:50,160
scepter so you have create a create app

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:55,590
with the example parameter on line 171

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,160
yeah bird 72 now yep but basically what

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,250
it dis allows you to do is provide like

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,710
which example has to be installed so

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,660
what is like if you don't provide an

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,410
example it just those fumes that is the

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:15,660
default template and so basically what

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:20,640
James if I remember correctly did was

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:24,410
yeah he moved out the check for that to

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,970
check if it's a string and then

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,040
obviously it's the same code then

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,220
basically he added in the extract check

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,710
so example if example exists an example

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,160
is not default then provide example and

00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:41,070
otherwise do undefined so what this

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,920
means is that if the example is set to

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,670
default it will be undefined so it

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,230
installs default template awesome and

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,020
like this seems like super approachable

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,610
to you as well like yeah it does take

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,190
like knowing where to go what to look

00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:02,430
but the solutions seem pretty

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:03,900
straightforward yeah so overall like

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,510
this is just like what a one-line change

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,850
right but even if it's a large has

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,240
changed like it's generally like in one

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,090
or two locations that you have to like

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,859
make these changes so yeah this is a

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,520
great for request that's done by an

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:22,470
external contributor and we still have

00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,970
to review it of course but like overall

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,380
it looks pretty good awesome yeah so I

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,810
appreciate you walking through that to

00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,889
you as well that's in a yeah be helpful

00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,439
for a lot of people to see

00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,999
not only did we walk into this and like

00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,099
see how packages work and see how the

00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:40,169
testing works too as well cuz it's a lot

00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,360
of times like I can open up a PR but I

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:43,919
have no idea how to get the test to run

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,210
so like knowing yet where the tests live

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,349
and sort of like some of the hoops you

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,860
have to jump through that's super

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,860
