Publication date: 2020-10-12
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 9th October 2020, 5pm AEDT. We interviewed Mislav MarohniÄ‡ from the newly launched GitHub CLI. We talked all about Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Mislav has been in the Open Source community and working as a maintainer for over 10 years so he has lots of words of wisdom.

here i've got the world time zone on my

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,800
watch and i'm pretty sure

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,360
is either well past 4 o'clock

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
it says in san francisco it's all eight

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,760
past 11

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,080
p.m in the evening so

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,760
um i suppose it's still 3 o'clock but it

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,480
is a thursday night still for you

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,200
in california over in san francisco say

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,920
hey exo great to have you here again

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
now miss slab tell us a little bit about

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
the github cli

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,319
it just got launched a couple weeks ago

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
and the team must be pretty happy with

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,680
it right

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,800
yeah we are um

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,680
really proud of the fact that we

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,360
um put up this like really stable

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,560
release that seemed to

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,200
work really well for um the

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,319
audience that we wanted to make it for

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,120
and

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,920
now for our team that's just kind of the

00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,599
beginning

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,360
because we wanted to put this first

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,120
release out there as like a bare minimum

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
that we could imagine putting something

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,159
that's called 1.0

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,080
and now we get to find out what

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
are all the other things that we could

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
build into it and what makes sense to be

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
in a github cli

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,200
so it's pretty cool so if you haven't

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,800
downloaded it you can go jump over to

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
the website and download it here but i'm

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
keen to hear from the chat

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
who has actually had a play around with

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,400
the github cli

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
recently like who's played with it what

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
are you doing with

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
it and how are you using now for those

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
of them

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,720
people in the chat who don't know what

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,879
the github cli is mislab

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,879
tell us what the github cli is all about

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
well if anyone's like me then they spend

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,760
a lot of time in a terminal

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
because for developers this is just what

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
a lot of tools already are

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
and myself i also am a heavy git cli

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
user as well

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,159
so it was the place where i do version

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
control and do most of my development

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
tasks

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
so we decided that it makes sense that a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
lot of also the

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
git up features like issues and pull

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
requests and um

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,640
similar things related usually related

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
repositories are also available

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
from the same terminal and there were

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
tools like this before

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
there was one like some official get up

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
to before called hub

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,239
and there are other third party ones um

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,639
but this is the first time that

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,040
we wanted to do something about it that

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,400
really has a get up name behind it

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
and what really kind of gave you and the

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,919
team the

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
the ideal the really clear indication

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
that the github cli should be open

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
source

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
when we discussed it we sometimes

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
discuss these things

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
um whenever i'm in on the github team

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
that decides to

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,720
make something open source we are

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
instead talking about why should this

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
not be open source

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
and if we can't really come up with any

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
strong reason

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,840
like for instance oh this would you know

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
expose us too much to some security

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,880
implications and things like that which

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
obviously this tool doesn't but then

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
some others might

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,400
um then for them for the time being we

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,919
don't do that but i think

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
i like to tend with my mentality and and

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
my peers as well

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
that we should try to open source as

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,600
much as possible so i think it only

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
makes sense especially because this is

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
good

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,000
that the tool is open source because

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,479
there's literally no reason to be closed

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
source

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,400
it's mostly an api client and i think

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,160
that's like

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
such a good mentality you have right

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
like i was in a stream the other day and

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
someone asked me something and i was

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,960
like

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,880
no i said why would you do that and i

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,479
was like why not like

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,800
you know like she said if you can't

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,080
think of any clear reasons not to do

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
something then you should definitely

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
do it it's not always about the why it's

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,199
often about the why not

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,360
um now if we talk about the um the

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,639
terminal it's open source people can go

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,520
and uh contribute to it and they can

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
check it out on

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,360
the repo here since you've gone

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,560
live on the github cli only a couple

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,440
weeks ago

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360
how much contribution have you had has

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,039
there been more contribution because of

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
oktoberfest like tell us a little bit

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,840
about what's been happening on the

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,400
contribution side of things

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,520
well so far i think

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,080
we've had

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,080
a lot of a lot of issues and requests

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
coming in especially after the 1.0

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
because people feel it's

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
the perfect time first of all there's a

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,720
lot of eyes on it and second of all

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,319
people feel like it's a perfect time to

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,360
voice the thing that they

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
feel like they imagine should be next

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,600
feature so we had an onslaught of

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,639
issues and um but in the pure quest side

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,360
i still haven't

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,280
felt yet the effects of hectoberfest i

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,479
think it's maybe a little bit early

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
but um i think that might be due to the

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,039
fact that we also had a lot of like

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
really good quality

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,120
contributions and contributors in the

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,680
time leading up

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
to the 1.0 because we were also pretty

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
active we were announcing releases back

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
then in beta

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,080
and kept really open communication with

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,479
everyone

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,319
and i would say that we wouldn't be able

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,160
to make it with the feature set that we

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,000
set for ourselves so 1.0 if

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
that hasn't been these contributors

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,919
could kind of step up and

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,639
and some of them spent even like weeks

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
working on

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,080
on a set of features and bouncing ideas

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
with us back and forth so that worked

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
really great

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
and i'm really looking forward to see

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,160
what the october is going to be like

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,080
and one of the questions we get a lot on

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
these open source brighter streams is

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
how do you encourage contributors to

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,880
come to the project how do you build

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,160
like a culture

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,080
and what your contribution is like so

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,759
why don't you tell me a little bit about

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
how you attract

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,120
contributors and then we might walk

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,840
through say if i want to contribute to

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
ci

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,599
what i would do as a first-time

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
contributor landing on this repo what

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,720
would i do where would i go

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,599
well that's probably one of the biggest

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
questions in open stars

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,479
yeah so maybe a little bit about how do

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,319
you attract people first like what are

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,199
some of the cultural things that you put

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,720
in place to

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,720
attract people to come to the project

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
so i would i would definitely say that

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
for most of my

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
experience being an open source

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,599
maintainer which is now about probably

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,400
more than 10 years

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,440
is that i don't think i was

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,759
always as good at it

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
i think i was uh often before acting as

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,599
sort of gatekeeper and

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,279
um made it really hard sometimes

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
unintentionally of course to contribute

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,680
to projects and

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,519
i feel that lately i've started to

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,599
realize some of the things that really

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,440
don't work out and and

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,279
um on the other hand some of the things

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
that do work out really well so we had a

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,240
chance to try it out with a

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,279
with a github cli and i feel that

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,800
the most important thing

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,920
is to make people feel included and part

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
of something

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,279
and that's a really tricky line to walk

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
because

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,399
on the other hand as um

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,320
any kind of core team on any sort of

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
project usually there's uh there's a

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
core team there's a group of

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,279
decision-making people

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,120
and those people ultimately have the the

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
decision-making power to drive the the

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
roadmap of a project and direction or

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,920
something like that

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,519
but i feel that when we say that making

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,640
few people included that's not just

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,240
inviting a name to to say oh come people

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,680
write features that we have already

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
planned out but

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,279
actually to have people's opinions and

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
people's feedback

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,760
affect the direction of the product as

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
well so i feel that

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,519
with github cli we open so much to

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
feedback and we've been asking

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,519
constantly since

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,240
even before beta and in during the whole

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,440
beta

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,800
process um we've had uh

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,160
the feedback form and of course

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,360
issues as ways to really keep

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,120
tabs on on what is the pulse of the

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,200
community and what do people want and i

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,800
think that worked really well

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,880
and i feel that years ago some of the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
projects that i was sometimes wondering

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,640
oh why does this very popular project

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
doesn't get as many contributions

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,399
now looking back i'm thinking oh maybe

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
because when people would comment

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
suggest things really kind of

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,120
shyly and cautiously because they're

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,600
maybe first time interacting with uh

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
me on that project i will be like no

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
that doesn't fit and just kind of didn't

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,040
let them

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
have any room there so in this project

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
we're doing

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
a way different thing but that's only

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,800
like the communication and

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,720
and and pre

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
jumping into the project perspective and

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,760
then i would say the next

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,320
thing after that would be making

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,920
if it's a project like ours which is a

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,760
code base that needs to be compiled and

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,440
built like making that first process

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,839
look really easy

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,040
and i think with the project uh like

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
ours in go

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
that would mean just sticking more

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,000
closely to the tools that people are

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
mostly familiar with

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
and i feel as soon as people can start

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,600
tinkering the sooner the people can

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
start ignoring seeing the effect of what

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
they do the easier

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,160
it's going to be for them to then either

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,600
solve

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,000
the bug they're having or add the

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,600
feature that really wanted to

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
yeah definitely now we're definitely

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
going to come back to some of your

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
experience in open source and your

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,640
journey into open source because you've

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,560
got as you said your

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
10 or plus years weather experience and

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,200
there's a lot of people here in the chat

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
they're definitely going to want to hear

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
from that experience but let's jump into

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,959
this

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,480
first time contributing type um

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,880
scenario because there's a lot of people

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,640
who come in and they look at a project

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
i've been getting questions all week

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
we've been

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,640
doing lots of hacktober fair streams of

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
you know how do you find a project or

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
then

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
once you've found a project how do you

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,680
work out if that's a good project to

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
contribute to

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,320
especially as a first-time user so let's

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,399
walk through it so say i landed on

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,519
we'll go to here on the code page on the

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
github client

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
and i'm thinking i want to contribute to

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,320
this project

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,760
what are the kind of things that i would

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,720
want to look out for

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
as a first-time contributor to say that

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,079
this

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,760
is a project that is welcoming that it's

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
what i want to contribute to and it's

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
something i could be involved in what

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
are these kind of things i want to look

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
at

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
well of course the first thing that

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,200
everybody reads a lot is to read me

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,320
and i would say that

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,160
um often i think it's really good to get

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
familiar with like the surface of the

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
tool like what are this current feature

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,519
set what is it doing

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,399
uh because just for trying it out once a

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,480
bit it doesn't

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,160
always reveal itself so

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,519
reading the documentation which is right

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
there that you can see

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
is sometimes very often a thing that i

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
sometimes see people skip

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,639
because they might be asking for

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
something that only exists or they

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,120
haven't like looked at it fully

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
and um i think we've done a really good

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,519
job of

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
automating the documentation generation

00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,920
from

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,760
the code itself so it's always up to

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,000
date and

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,320
um we then link on the bottom of this

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
page to the issues page where people can

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,279
can look at feedback

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
and they're on the issues page i would

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,680
definitely

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,200
the first thing check what is already

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
open because there's a lot of things or

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
they open we have a huge backlog and

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
people also working on some pull

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
requests

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
and that's another thing that we're

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
seeing is a lot of people just

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,440
don't first look at what's already out

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,560
there and they just kind of re-request

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,360
similar things the way i like to

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,519
familiarize

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
myself with the project is i look not

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,680
just the open issues but i often look

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,360
also the closed issues based on some

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,440
topic that i'm interested in to see if

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
that's been discussed in the past

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
maybe that's been suggested but also

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,199
rejected because it doesn't fit with a

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,199
philosophy of the project so i feel the

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,720
one small thing that everyone can do for

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,560
maintainers is just

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,480
make sure that they're not just adding

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,839
to the backlog but without kind of do

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
making due diligence first and then

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,600
lastly i i feel if somebody really wants

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,279
to dive in the code and i would seek out

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,839
the contributing doc

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
uh and that one is shown to people on

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
github

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,120
whenever they open a pull request but

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,639
they can also just uh look it up in a

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,480
in the source tree and i would say

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,920
if it's not linked from the readme then

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,399
it would be just in a list of the files

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,399
oh the contributing dock is under dot

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
github a little tip for everyone that

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,480
i've been telling on my streams if

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,959
you're on a code base

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,399
and you don't know what where the file

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,680
is located because i'm like i don't know

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,199
where the file's located

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,800
press t on any repo code base

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,959
and it'll bring up a search tool or

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
search every single file that you need

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,040
to so i just typed

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,560
contribute there and it popped up so

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,519
here we go so here's the contributing

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,120
docs

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,560
this looks really nice and easy there's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,000
one thing we often tell

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,120
new time and first time contributors is

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,720
looking at um the contribution

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
guidelines and looking and saying you

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
know does it

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
doesn't feel welcoming does it feel easy

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,480
to contribute and what i like

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,720
is this do's and don'ts it really it

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,279
really easily shows you like

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
what to do and what not to do so how's

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,600
the feedback being missed live from

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
the contributing docs and for first-time

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
contributors coming to the project so

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,440
far

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
i think we've seen that people find it

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,199
really easy mostly because of what i

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,399
said earlier that we just take out to

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,920
stuck to the

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,399
default build tool and um the fact that

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,079
project

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,000
pretty much runs on almost anyone's

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,800
machine out of the box or at least if it

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,199
doesn't

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,120
compile we haven't heard of it since so

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,759
that also is a testament to the quality

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,880
of the gold tool set as well i would say

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,639
um and i feel that

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,959
the stumbling blocks there aren't like

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,519
starting out but maybe figuring out

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,440
um deeper things for instance how to

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,040
like effectively run tests and things

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
like that and that is also something

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
that we are

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,360
also figuring out how to effectively

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,399
cover our

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
code base with the test suite so um we

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,279
completely understand that somebody gets

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
a little bit stuck on that part it

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,240
doesn't know

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,480
um how the current ones are wired up

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,839
that's when we step in and kind of

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,360
help out with somebody's

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,079
code contribution and

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,600
regarding the do's and don'ts that i

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
felt that was really important like we

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,399
want to encourage people to

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,480
like contribute but we also

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,079
kind of want to keep some boundaries and

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,320
that is also one of these

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,320
fine lines that uh the open source

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
project needs to walk regarding

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,600
everyone's input anything like that like

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,519
i said like our

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,959
decision making is is um gonna prevail

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,920
in the end but we do wanna

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,000
be open to influence from our community

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,519
but also sometimes

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,600
um if we don't put up boundaries at

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,600
upfront of like what kind of things do

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
we absolutely don't want to look at

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,520
right now

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,280
um so um maybe there's some feature that

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,760
requires us to tap into some like

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
semi-private or very newish github apis

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,439
that is something that we we would

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,720
definitely like to explore ourselves

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,919
and then we label those um

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,439
features appropriately so that we

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
would like to avoid somebody really

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,839
spending a lot of time working on those

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,000
just to

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,160
for us to tell us oh sorry we won't be

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,720
even reviewing this poor request because

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
so and so reasons right so we have some

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
of the least of those things

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
in the please avoid or the don'ts

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
because we've been getting

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,480
um yeah we've had to disappoint a lot of

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,520
people by telling them oh

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
this was a little bit too hasty and we

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
need some time to

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,200
look it into this ourselves now i've got

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,679
a little bit of confusion in the chat so

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
i'm going to

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
clear out this confusion for you right

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,760
now so the github cli

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,200
is open source so anyone who's thinking

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
that it's not open source

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,799
um github cli is 100 open source it is

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,640
free

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,919
you are able to contribute to it as well

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,160
and they're welcoming

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,200
contributors uh from everyone we're

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
going to talk about a little bit

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,640
about the types of contributors that

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,840
you'd like to see to this life now we've

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
got some questions about

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,720
actually supporting or participating in

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,039
hockey fest now people have realized

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,919
hacktoberfest this year for the first

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,520
year

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,120
is opt-in only so the project you want

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
to contribute to for octoberfest

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,320
uh must be opted in so that's one of the

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,200
questions i was about to ask you next

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
miss livers

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,440
is the github cli um participating in

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,440
hacktoberfest at the moment

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,080
i'm only learning right now that the egg

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
oktoberfest is obtained so that was the

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,600
difference than before

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,000
and i don't think that we've explicitly

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,320
opted in so i have to look up into that

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
so there you go so i'm assuming you

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,919
would like to participate in

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,000
october 1st and yeah it only happened a

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
couple of days ago but i'm opt-in only

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
now for hacktoberfest

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
so miss life is going to go check that

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
out for people so

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
if anyone wants to check out the

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
projects that have opted in for

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,080
hacktoefest you can jump over to the

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,080
oktoberfest website there's almost 34

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840
000 open source projects that have opted

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
in for hacktoberfest

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
um feel free to have a look at those as

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,720
well but github cli should be on there

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,720
very soon right

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,039
now we're looking at the types of

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,640
contributors that you would like to come

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
to the project now lots of people look

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
for

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,080
you know a certain type of contributor

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,200
on their coder

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,880
people looking at contributing to

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,320
documentation with different projects

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,240
now what are the kinds of people

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,840
or developers you're looking at for

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,840
contributing to the cli

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,360
for the first thing is go developers

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,240
considering that 99.5 percent of this

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,880
repo is written in go

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
yeah right now the repo is really

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
straightforward most of the code doesn't

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
go

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,160
uh there's of course a lot of

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,919
documentation because all of the

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,799
documentation for commands is embedded

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
in there in the go

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,880
source so it's uh um i guess

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,559
the documentation here is counted as go

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,960
code even though it's just

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,240
long multi-line strings that can be

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,919
edited by anyone

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
and for instance now that i'm saying

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,640
that i'm also wondering about oh would

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,679
it lower a barrier of a

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,120
barrier of entry if uh documentation was

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,919
extracted out of

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,440
uh go files into markdown files so that

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,559
somebody doesn't feel maybe don't

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
that they have to edit a long go string

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,880
when they feel they have no go

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,080
experience and that is something

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,520
also that we considered and um we're

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
going to look into even though they will

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
make

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,200
maybe the build process slightly more

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,600
complicated

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,760
but i firmly believe that a project

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,440
needs all sorts of contributors

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,200
uh not just the code ones

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,159
i used to believe that the code ones

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,159
were the most

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,159
i would how would they say

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,320
i used to strongly feel that i really

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
like to see the code ones the most as a

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,440
maintainer

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,039
because those were the ones that will

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,880
help me out the most like if somebody

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,400
sold the bug then i'm just saved

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,880
hours by um not having to find it

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,480
myself especially if it's obscure and

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
another system that i don't use every

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,600
day like windows

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,840
and um but now i believe that there's

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,760
sort of like a long tail effect to that

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,280
as well that even though there's some

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,960
contributions that are really heavy on

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
code first and foremost and they

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
look really big and they seem like

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,799
they've

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,200
saved us a lot of hours or something but

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,320
if behind that one there's also a

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
100 really small ones ranging from a

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,280
type of fix to

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,039
just a small documentation change those

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,320
really help as well

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,000
and i feel that contributors

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
contributors especially those who

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,520
contribute documentation they have a

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,919
really good outside perspective because

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,280
they just went probably half an hour ago

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
through the process of setting up the

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,760
project or if something didn't work for

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
them

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,520
or anything like that when people

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,720
contribute installation docs

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,280
or tips how to set things up on another

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,520
system

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,200
that we haven't covered really well

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,960
that's amazing as well

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:23,039
not because um that

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,039
helps us as much because we

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
probably not going to set it up on the

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,000
same system but yeah

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
you're worried about the code right you

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,799
don't want to worry about all the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,280
documentation and all those other things

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,240
you have to worry about right

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,679
yeah and i feel that in that way people

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,039
are looking out for each other so

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,120
contributors are looking out sometimes

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,520
for other contributors that way

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,039
um and the project that's more larger in

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,120
size the github cli

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,960
is also going to have

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,240
different types of contributors as well

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,280
which is outside

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
of code or documentation which is

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,200
something's design

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
and things like that so ours being in a

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,240
terminal we don't do

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,360
much graphical things except the color

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,360
and spacing but i do believe that

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,640
there's should be room for everyone so i

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,039
think we've kind of

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,400
phasing out that mentality that that

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,039
people involved in open source could

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
only be

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,120
people who are really intimately

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,720
experienced with a certain runtime or

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,159
sydney programming language

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
and i think that's what's happening

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,159
across the open source community as well

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
we're seeing especially like with

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
um things like oktoberfest and new

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,679
projects that are coming up they're

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,679
saying they want contributors from

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
like a bunch of different walks of life

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,559
i know one of the

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,320
teams that we interviewed on this a

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
couple weeks ago have have their hack

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,320
trouble festival and they have

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,240
columns so contributors uh you know

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,799
requests for contributors from design

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,279
and

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,880
documentation and writing and graphics

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,000
and things like that so it's really cool

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,600
to see that

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,039
that kind of mentality is changing and

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
people realizing that

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,480
a project doesn't just involve just

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,799
developers

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
like yes you've got to actually write

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,320
and develop the code base and the

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,600
product itself there's so many other

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,360
things that go on top and it's really

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,200
really cool to see i think

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,960
now i want to talk a little bit about

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,159
your experience at open source because

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
eventually you've got like

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,559
10 plus years experience which is insane

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
so how did you actually get

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,840
into open source and get involved to

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,840
start with

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,520
well back when

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,559
back before there was github which is

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,159
this murky era of my memory that i can't

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,279
really remember but i remember like

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,880
it was very long ago we just used svn

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:42,080
to um to uh

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
obtain code and still there was this era

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,000
of sending patches to mailing lists

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,480
which was you know for me a distant

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,600
memory and it's still a reality for

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
some communities like the linux kernel i

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,360
would

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,440
guess and uh things like that but i

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,520
i do remember that back then i was a

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,559
contributor to

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,200
early on rails but before that's

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,000
a php framework of sorts i would say zen

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,559
framework

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,279
and that was still before i was really

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,679
big on

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,200
on php and later i transitioned into

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,840
ruby because i just

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,200
i was following more kind of exciting

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,600
and scripting

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
language that will allow me to do meta

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,520
programming and create dsl

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,279
dsls and things like that so that got me

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,520
really excited about ruby and eventually

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,440
i landed up in rails world

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
and i think those specifically things

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,080
led me onto github

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,559
because this kind of ruby community and

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,039
rails community came up with

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,039
um or a few individuals from that

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,880
community came up with github and then

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,960
later on the first

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,640
a few high-profile projects that would

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,320
have moved on to

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
uh github was this uh rails related

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,200
project and uh

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
since i was a maintainer back then off

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,720
of a plug-in for rails called will

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,159
paginate i just

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
i think that was probably my first

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,279
project that i migrated over

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,799
from svn to git and had to teach myself

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
git in the process because i wanted to

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,200
be a part of this thing called github

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,720
but i didn't know

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,919
good at all and started learning it from

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,159
the command line

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,919
back then there was probably not so much

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,799
of the nicer interfaces like it of

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,000
desktop and

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,919
and some other guise form

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,600
for git so the literally the only

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
way you could learn it and use it first

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,039
from terminal

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
and then i was as i was learning it i

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,320
would be writing my own scripts and

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,760
little workarounds

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,080
and eventually start writing

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,760
the first get up cli or start

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
contributing the first git of cli that

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,760
was

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,279
that's called hub and still exists but

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,279
someone in the chat was just talking

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,159
about hub they were saying that they've

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,919
they've just

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
installed hub now they should go get

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,360
github celia cli so

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,360
is that the following is it

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,039
yeah the the hub was created by the the

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,520
ceo of github

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,559
back then chris weinstra and it was

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,159
mostly like a

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,640
proof of concept in a sense like oh

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
tiny little ruby script that wraps kit

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
and does

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,200
magic with it and it was like whoa and

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
then

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,399
i liked it a lot because it helped me

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
learn as well

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,360
and also dissecting it and seeing how

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,960
things are implemented and then of

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,440
course i had my ideas to add

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,640
and um the project wasn't really

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
strictly maintained

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,600
in the sense that it didn't have any

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
kind of direction or vision what it was

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,640
to be

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,440
so it was kind of like oh you had this

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,559
weird command

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,279
and you had this one um but

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,559
the creator's involvement with it it's

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,120
kind of like

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,840
fell off after a while like it often

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,039
does and

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,559
there's no um it's

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
it's just i feel like it's a natural

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,840
cycle of a lot of

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,760
business project if nobody picks them up

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,200
but in case this case i really picked it

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,039
up because i was really enthusiastic

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,159
about it and kept adding and adding and

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,880
adding to it

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,840
and was maintaining it actively for 10

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,440
years

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,919
during which time github was

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,919
really grew and growing features and

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,279
when those features received apis we

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,960
would add them as support

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,960
to um to hub and therefore get up

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,240
all this time since almost since

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,760
inception did have

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,880
a cli it's just that the cli was

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,720
um i wouldn't say a toy

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,880
because that really feels like i'm

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,159
trying to under

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,120
um underplay its role

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,640
and the the fact that it's like really

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,480
useful i still use it

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,399
for for some things that github cli

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
doesn't do so using the same computer

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,919
both hub and

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
get up cli and i'm going to maintain hub

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,760
for a little bit more

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,360
and and

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,600
i feel that after a certain while

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
i realized and also we just realized it

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,080
get up that

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,919
uh that it's that the scope of the

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,399
project wasn't really well defined

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,080
and that it would be really kind of

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,880
risky and shaky to continue with its

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,200
code base

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,880
it would need a lot of it would need

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
definitely breaking changes a lot of

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,520
breaking changes to

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
put it at some point in which we could

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,559
call it okay it's now some official get

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
a product that we call

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,799
1.0 or something like that and because i

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
didn't think that that was a really

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,679
healthy thing to do

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,919
to people who are currently using hub to

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,360
start like reshaping it in a way that

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,360
would break in a lot of ways for

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,200
existing users it was a much better idea

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,960
just to start a fresh code base

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
it was not an easy decision it was a

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,279
very hard decision people are still

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,600
questioning

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
it today and thinking oh couldn't you

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,159
just

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,799
this or that but i feel that breaking up

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,240
with the old paradigm of how hub was

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,200
designed and starting with the

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,840
the new one was really necessary to

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,919
ensure

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
that maybe this project now lives for 10

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,200
years more

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,880
so when did the github cli really break

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,200
away from the hub and start becoming its

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,520
own project obviously it's only been

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
released out of beta and publicly

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,080
available recently but when did the

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,399
project itself really start

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,640
i think we wrote the first lines of code

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,240
exactly a year ago because i remember

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
it probably was october yeah so really

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,399
short

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,320
turnaround time and for a project you

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,720
mentioned that like um

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,159
when you started working on the hub all

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,039
the other maintenance left and you

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,159
picked it up

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,919
um so obviously that is a breaking point

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,200
if you will of open sources

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,760
you know all the maintainers going to

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,440
stay um so with the github cli how many

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,840
maintainers are there like core

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,640
maintainers either to the project

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
or is it just you

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:48,720
on the get upsili no thankfully

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,720
you're not the only one

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,559
thankfully it's a whole team right now

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,840
we're three engineers and a designer

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,640
and soon our product manager is

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,840
uh coming back from parental leave as

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,360
well so

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,080
will be a really different experience

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,960
for me

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,039
working in a whole team than it was on

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,559
hub working on weekends in my free time

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,519
definitely and making decisions for

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
myself

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,399
i feel with um a whole team of people

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,640
bouncing ideas of each other and getting

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,559
that initial really healthy perspective

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,519
from others is is what makes

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,480
just it better that we could make almost

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,080
surpass the

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,240
initial tool that was built over 10

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,399
years in just a year

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,159
and having a team around you just makes

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,720
things a lot easier right

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,200
just yeah yeah you can bounce ideas off

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,799
people

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,399
you know obviously you get more work

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,000
done but just having that your

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,519
team driving the project i think is

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,120
really key now i've got a couple of

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,960
questions coming from the chat so

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,720
keep the questions coming we're going to

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
ask this song feel free to

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,320
shaft it back to me if you want to but

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,080
uh is the github client going to be an

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,840
npm package like git

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,679
and others talk about github for cli and

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,080
npm there

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,919
yeah i i wouldn't say necessarily no

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,600
completely because i was actually

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,480
surprised at what sort of

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,559
things were packaged in npm um

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,200
successfully and then distributed like

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
that

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,960
i used to think that it's only for

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,159
javascript libraries and then

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
later it dawned on me that the

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,880
javascript community is actually using

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,399
it a lot

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,960
as also a distribution tool so

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,000
i think when i realized that was when i

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,120
would see

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,760
maybe binaries of phantomjs the the

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,799
headless browser test runner packaged in

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,039
npm

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,960
and people were really finding it much

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,720
easier to install that way

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
so i wouldn't necessarily say no but

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,360
right now we're not

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,039
um we feel that the current ways and

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,720
installation of the binaries

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,840
are are pretty much available to

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,600
anyone on any system and that

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,679
we don't feel strongly about necessarily

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,480
making available trim pm especially then

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,960
because

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,679
that's a commitment that we have to keep

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
up

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,840
and we can't just try it out for a month

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
and see how we feel about it and then

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,880
when people have bad experience with it

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,480
we can just kind of backtrack out of it

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,720
and stop publishing updates no

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,480
as soon as we commit to it we need at

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,679
least for a while kind of like all

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,559
in right yeah we need to go all in so

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,440
we should first see how we feel about

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,360
that but i think

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,279
people haven't there's only been maybe

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,679
two requests so far

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,360
um that are hinting at that and i feel

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,600
that everybody else was

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,600
finding it really easy to install using

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,679
their package manager of choice

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,760
um on a system and i now i ignored npm

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,360
as a package manager of a choice but

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,440
um like a more os based one

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,480
like uh apt-get on ubuntu or debian

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,399
or homebrew on mac os which is not

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,640
official but i think it's

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,559
almost like positioning itself as an

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,240
official package manager for

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,799
uh os access as as

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,360
far as my experiences definitely now

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,000
we've got

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,600
um obviously it only got released not

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,799
that long ago we've already got

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,720
github one cli 1.1 out already

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,200
so what other kind of things are you

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,639
looking at for the future of cli now

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,159
obviously you're taking a lot of

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,240
feedback from the community

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
what sort of some of the big picture

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,839
goals or some of the

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
uh the plans the cli in the future

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,919
well i feel that that we wanna

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,520
we wanna definitely figure out

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,359
what are the sort of workflows that

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,960
people do through the terminal still and

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,359
how we can expose some things um

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,760
that otherwise people have to jump in

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,240
between the browser and the terminal for

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
and not all of them are equally good

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,159
ideas for cli for instance some people

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,079
have suggested projects and project

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,359
boards and cards to be exposed somehow

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,520
through cli

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,960
and we consider that briefly but then we

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
try to imagine

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,560
this like highly visual tool which is

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,000
split into these columns or something

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,599
even though you can technically force

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,880
that output through a

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,440
terminal using ascii tables or something

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
like that

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
it's not really experience that we want

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,040
for users

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
so instead we're not gonna explore so

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
much too much in that direction which we

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,119
still

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,040
believe that uh the graphical interface

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,800
like literally projects boards on the

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,720
web would be much more effective to

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,920
manage that

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,359
but i uh i'm more looking towards things

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,520
that

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,480
first of all my primary

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,320
way of thinking about projects like this

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,280
so that get up cli would be how much we

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
can expose

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
raw data to users for them to write

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,800
their own scripts

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
and that is always going to be a sub

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,240
feature that is built a little bit

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,040
underneath the surface of the cli and

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,680
that is that it's

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,520
really handy to use for scripting so i

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,520
do want to continue investing into like

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,119
oh what sort of data could we liberate

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,480
through the github cli

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,920
um to people who want to write scripts

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,680
but they necessarily don't want to write

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,880
scripts that

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,720
directly interface with a github api

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,320
because there's then a lot of json

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,599
parsing and notification and things like

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,359
that they want to handle

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,640
and with this they have a tool already

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,079
that went through all of that that can

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
do the parsing to them they can do

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,000
identification for them

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,760
and then if they can access a lot of

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
their data in a sort of like a lower

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,599
level format then

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,920
maybe they could write their custom git

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,920
workflows and aliases and scripts

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,400
like that so i see it really like it's

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,040
like a lego playground for

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,640
instructors yeah that's something that

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,000
excites me about terminals is that

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,359
basically all the tools can

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,880
be made to communicate to each other

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,440
because they all operate on lines of

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
text

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,160
and that's like a shared paradigm for so

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,040
many of them that that can be then

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,079
combined

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,280
like legos in that way then

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,680
some of the tools that are highly

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,000
requested of things like to

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,480
manage repository secrets which makes

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,880
absolutely sense for

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,079
a tool like this and i would like us to

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,760
look into

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,359
this as well especially now after 1.0 um

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,720
and small things like adding gpg keys

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,440
to somebody's account which kind of

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,240
seems

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,240
maybe like too specific but it actually

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,440
makes absolutely sense when we think

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,760
about when people

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
setting up with code with signing their

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,560
commits in gpg they mostly do that

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
from their terminal right and if there's

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,920
a tool already to

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,520
kind of capture that whole process

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,280
streamline it for them and connect it to

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,359
their account immediately with them

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
without them having to like well copy

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,520
this code now and now open the browser

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,839
and log

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,640
in and paste it there over your account

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,520
so if we can

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,599
help people not having to already make a

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,000
complicated process more complicated

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,680
then

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,599
we'll totally gonna jump at the

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,480
opportunity

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
100 we've got uh some people in the chat

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,760
we've got um

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,680
lost algorithm has said thanks for your

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,079
work on cli has changed so many

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,320
workflows for the better over this side

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
so thanks for that uh lost algorithm we

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,240
love people showing their appreciation

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,079
so you're talking literally to the

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,160
man who's been heading up the whole

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,800
project and we've got some questions as

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,440
well around

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,960
um what's the uptake of like cli like

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
obviously we've got lots of

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,160
oh look again we've got 280 open issues

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,320
there's not to say anything about the

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
800 plus issues that are already

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,359
closed and we've got lots of poor

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,760
requires but what's the

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,720
uptake of the actual cli like like have

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,839
we seen

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,839
lots of people download it enjoy it

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,720
what's the kind of feedback been like so

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,440
far i think

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,440
the feedback has been lots of people

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
have definitely tried it because we

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
the only way we can see the people's

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,720
activity because we cli doesn't have any

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,440
kind of tracking

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,000
uh in it uh the only way that we can see

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
activity

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,680
is by just looking at the traffic

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,839
generates to the github api which is the

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,240
only way we have of it right now

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,280
and uh even though we had a really

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,760
active

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,880
beta uh period we've seen

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,480
four or five times as much activity just

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,480
a few days after um the announcement so

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,720
lots of people are trying it out

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,359
and do we wanna we want to

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,240
position it as a sort of like an

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,119
indispensable

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,720
just part of of a tool set um when

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,400
somebody's working with github

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,160
uh and of course this is just for people

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,599
who are using their terminals so i

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,200
understand there's a lot of github users

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,200
they're not like me they don't

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,640
live their whole days in the terminal

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,160
yeah i definitely don't live my whole

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,560
day in the terminal i've started using

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,440
the terminal a lot more since github cli

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,960
got released

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
and i started playing around with it a

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
little bit more i'm like well this is

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,720
actually really fun

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,920
but yeah i've been really enjoying it so

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,599
yeah it's been

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,200
like this is really cool i can write

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,920
something and then something happens

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,680
over

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
there and then you go into the website

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
and or like the browser you see it

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,240
change

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,920
it for me like i'm i'm not a developer

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
by background i've been doing more dev

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,240
work

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,839
but um for me to be able to go under the

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,640
browser and actually see all that change

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,640
is really really cool

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,480
it makes me really happy that we make

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,400
this

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,079
tasks of version control and things

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,359
around it like project management and

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,960
issues and things like that more

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,200
accessible to everyone

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,800
because then like we said earlier with

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,359
the code contributions and then not

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,040
being

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,880
the only kind of contributions i think

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,680
just generally raise lowering the

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,400
barriers of

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,920
entry for all kinds of people in in the

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,680
tech space is just a win

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,640
in in my view and if we can help that

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,040
with this tool and make it like powerful

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,079
for power users but accessible also for

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,240
everyone else that's that's my

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,000
main goal i would say yeah and i think

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,720
i'm going to ask you a question so for

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,680
me

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,599
i've been really loving the clone repo

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,839
because i work a lot with um

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,960
like projects and i'm doing like

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,640
learning the code

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
and so for me being able to like clone a

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,960
reaper and put on my local desktop

00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,920
and then throw it into github desktop

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,520
and then like

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,440
do all the changes it needs and then

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,119
like see the outfit i think that for me

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,880
is like probably my favorite

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,160
um thing as well as like being able to

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,040
open an issue

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,400
so what is your favorite thing um about

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,920
the the github server like what is your

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,920
favorite like command basically

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,000
well i would say that the swiss army

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,760
knife

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,720
of github cli would be the api command

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,400
which is just

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,839
something that i touched on previously

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,400
like a

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,119
lower level command to just make raw api

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,680
requests but

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,040
also without having to figure out a lot

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,240
of encoding

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,920
uh by yourself and right now it's still

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,359
it is a little bit manual still because

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
you do need to somehow process the

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,240
result of that

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,680
um but it it makes a lot of api

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,839
tasks a little bit easier just a tad

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,839
easier for everyone and i would like to

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,160
also continue in that fashion and make

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,280
it

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,040
even more uh accessible to the point

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,319
that even no json parsing utilities are

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,079
needed on the other end

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,440
and things like that and

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,440
so one single command that would

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,200
definitely be my favorite is that one

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,520
but then also my favorite feature is

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,079
spread across

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,599
uh multiple commands and that would be

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,920
the fact that

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,359
um a lot of the outputs like for

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,000
instance listing issues

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,400
uh is formatted really nicely for for a

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,319
terminal but then it's got emojis in it

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,599
i love that when i like first said i was

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,119
like

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,119
in the tunnel is a cycle

00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
and we try to make it nicer without

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,480
going over

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
over the top but we try to support

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,440
anything that the github already

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,720
supports

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,079
and and i feel that for those commands

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,319
that's what's happening under the hood

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,160
is

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,760
if their output is redirected to script

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,680
instead of straight to your terminal

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,520
which is formatted really nicely then we

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,520
don't do the colors we don't do the

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,040
nice formatting but we kind of output

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,839
these raw data streams

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,280
so people can choose how they want to

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,280
see the data they can either

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,720
intake in their terminal visually or

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,520
they can pipe into a script where they

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,280
kind of further filter it and process it

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
so my favorite feature would be the fact

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,160
that it's so adaptable that it's

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,400
versatile

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,680
to different styles of views yeah i

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,680
think it's really cool and i

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,359
obviously did the the github command

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,280
line little two-minute

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,560
social video that went out and there's a

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,760
few of the things that i was doing i'm

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,599
like wow this is

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
this would be a really really cool

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,440
feature that's going to just blow

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,200
people's minds we've got a question in

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,440
the chat um

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,599
from techy man which says he's asking

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,319
like what feature of the github client

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,160
do you think

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,280
actually has the most value you talked

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,240
about some of your favorites but what do

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,920
you think actually has

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,920
the most value to developers

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,440
well it's hard to just select one

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,040
feature but definitely what

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,800
is proven to be the most popular feature

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,640
set and that's not a single command i

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
would say the set of commands around

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,680
pull requests they're kind of closely

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,280
related

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,160
you they flow from one to another so for

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,319
instance

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,839
checking out the pull request um and

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,680
then doing some other tasks

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,440
while you've have the checked output

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,400
requests like for instance merging it

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,920
from the

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,680
github cli or um

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,319
or or

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,960
basically we have a bunch of other

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,960
operations

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,000
yeah that was the one that i did in the

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,560
short video that i'm like this is

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,400
this is cool that you can actually like

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,280
check out the pull request

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,839
comment on it review it merge it close

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,240
it

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,480
all from the terminal like it's it's

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,560
pretty crazy

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,920
so if i could pick a favorite of those i

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,599
would say definitely checking out pull

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,160
requests because that helps people so

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,240
much

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,800
that they could basically paste in

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,200
either url or just type a number of

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,560
requests and have it uh have it be

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,839
checked out and they can immediately

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,319
then go into

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,000
maybe running the test suite and making

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,760
some changes they want to add to this

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,440
pull request as a maintainer

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,280
but i would say just this whole set of

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,839
operations on pull requests

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,520
makes the most sense for the terminal

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,800
because this is already where people are

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,960
editing their code

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,599
and running tests and maybe running some

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,720
of the other tooling for

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,119
rest of their code bases and

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,520
that we brought this set of like poor

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,240
request related actions and tools there

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,440
i feel that

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,680
makes almost the most sense for

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,680
people who need this sort of access

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,079
who would otherwise have to jump to

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,480
between github.com and their terminal

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,280
so i feel that's in and that's not only

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,760
my feeling

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,560
i think that from the stats that we got

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,800
it it looks like the pull request

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,319
set of related commands including poor

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,280
request creating as well from the

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,079
command line is

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,760
by far the most used set of commands and

00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,640
we've got a copy of the chat saying

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,680
we like creating issues so that was one

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
of the things that i tried out and

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,880
that's what you see in the emojis so if

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,319
you've got an issue template the mojit

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,000
comes up and it's really cool

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,079
now we haven't got that long left and i

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,839
did want to jump back a little bit

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,920
so again to your experience because

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,640
you've got so much experience in this

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,560
space

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,640
uh you talked a little bit about how you

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,640
got involved in open source you kind of

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,079
like just fell into it after

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,119
finding something that you really were

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,480
passionate about all the other

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,880
maintainers left and then you're like

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,400
cool

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,040
i like this project so i'm gonna take it

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,480
over um but for those people

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,359
out there we've got people in the chat

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,880
we're going to people have been

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,599
listening to this afterwards

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,280
what are kind of your top tips to those

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,440
people out there who

00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,359
may be thinking about contributing or

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,800
getting into open source but

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,880
maybe you don't know where to start or

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,040
just don't have the

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,480
right mentality to get started like what

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,480
is your tips to those people

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,160
i would say the strongest motivation

00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,720
that i ever felt for contributing to a

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,520
project

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,760
is something that was i either intended

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,280
to use it or was already using it

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,839
um and maybe that only works out

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,119
when somebody is already into the

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,560
development world which i really

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,640
definitely was i was

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,560
was using all these tools like php

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,960
libraries and ruby libraries initially

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,880
when

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,560
learning into development and i feel

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,160
that in this space of

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,480
all these open source tools for instance

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,160
ruby itself being open source

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,160
or node.js or um

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
sets of all this related tooling around

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,079
it um

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,200
it's it's impossible to even like move

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,800
an inch without

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,960
using some kind of open-source tooling

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,640
and inevitably it's gonna either

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,880
not do what it was supposed to do what

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,079
it says on a on a tin

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,839
or it's going to miss something

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:49,359
and i think the open source

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:51,280
contributor mindset comes with the

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,480
with just daring to ask yourself oh

00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,960
could i be a part of

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,400
making this better for not just thinking

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,240
this is something that other people

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,400
have this is something that other people

00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,680
have created and i am just kind of a

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,280
consumer all of these

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,960
things but to remind yourself like quite

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,040
ordinary people in their

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,880
living rooms in their bedrooms and in

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,640
their weekends have created

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:20,640
uh these things in their free time um

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,680
without much often without so much

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,040
forethought or um

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,599
or even research so i think

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,079
the primary thing that i would suggest

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,000
to

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:37,280
anyone to who's considering contributing

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
is to not

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,280
to try to dispel completely the impostor

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,559
syndrome because i i notice

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,319
something's too strong i have it

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,559
definitely myself that we can't just

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,319
wish it away but at least try to resist

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,359
it like put up a little bit of a fight

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,319
by reminding yourself

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,960
rationally kind of these are people just

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,079
like me

00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:00,000
and i feel that i also have some input

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,800
to to do and to technically find that

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,800
project

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,119
that's the next step after the courage

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,559
step of the summoning the courage step

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,280
i would say the next step would be

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,079
selecting the project and the task to do

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,400
on it and for me it was always the

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,880
easiest to select something that i was

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,079
actively using as i said already or

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,640
considering using

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,920
or or had even trouble figuring out how

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,720
to start it up sometimes my

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,640
contributions

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,640
came from the fact that i tried to use

00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,240
something and it didn't work at all and

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,400
like other people are gonna have this

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,160
problem too we gotta fix it

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,480
yeah or um or i would

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,400
uh i would just maybe contribute the

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,160
communication that explains

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,760
what this thing is because i was reading

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,359
i was reading the marketing page and

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,359
maybe some project wouldn't even say

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,119
what it is and then i'm shaking it

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:50,400
virtually by the shoulders and

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,000
and thinking what are you telling me

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,599
so even just like that would be like

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,680
here here's a contribution i'm never

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,200
going to use your project again

00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,359
i don't say that but i'm thinking that

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,520
but here's a poor request for you

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,720
and maybe it get merged maybe it doesn't

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,200
uh

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,559
and oh maybe this last point could be

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,720
actually also a very good

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,599
thing to keep in mind the fact that if

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,880
we go

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,200
really emotionally heavy into attaching

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,640
that uh whatever our contribution be is

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,440
going to immediately land into the

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,800
project and

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,559
people are going to carry us out of the

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,720
building on their shoulders

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,920
um sometimes it's not going to work out

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,240
like that most of my initial

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,319
contributions were just rejected as

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,160
wow this is just too much like the diff

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,720
is too much it just

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,760
doesn't like fit into the philosophy of

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,119
our project

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,720
and now i understand

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,319
those reactions from maintainers back

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,319
then to my contribution because this is

00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,440
exactly how i react now when i get a

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,640
pull request that for

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,760
small relatively small changes has a too

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,400
big of a diff and

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,400
i would say

00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,480
go going into the discourage also means

00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,160
that

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,160
it's like asking somebody a question

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,119
that has a yes or no and being ready to

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,200
get a no back

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,960
as well that's a part of asking and i

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,640
feel a part of contributing is also like

00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,119
accepting that it might be no back

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,079
and that it's nothing personal but it's

00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,440
mostly just

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,960
um an opportunity to you to kind of then

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,880
reshape how you think about this project

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,160
so maybe the feature was too large what

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,720
if we break it down

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,520
and to bare minimum that could still

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,599
help you

00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,800
but would be maybe acceptable by

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,079
maintainers

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,000
and then um i think with my initial

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,920
contributions after a while i learned

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,839
that i need to think more like

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,040
how maintainers felt about their project

00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,440
and align more with

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,559
with their idea and then i would make my

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,319
contributions more

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,200
viable and therefore more uh

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,640
more easier for them to review and

00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,240
eventually to merge

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,760
so there was a lot of mistakes made

00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,680
initially but i feel that

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,440
nobody should try to really skip past

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,240
them like there's really no shortcuts

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,319
that

00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,760
um we should go through them and we

00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,839
should just all have

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,000
patience for each other and support

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,520
while we all go through that as well so

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,760
basically be humble

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,720
and don't get discouraged if your pull

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,440
request doesn't get merged right

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,359
definitely yeah that's a lot of really

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,800
really good tips second tutorials

00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,640
we do have a lot of people who are

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,280
dropping into these open source streams

00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,559
uh if you are maintainers or who are

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,160
starting a project

00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,839
so what kind of top tips do you have for

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,800
those especially as someone who's been

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,319
maintaining

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
projects for 10 years you said you've

00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,839
learned a lot so what are your some of

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,839
your top tips and maintainers

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,319
for maintenance of the project i would

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,400
say

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,640
to i would say that very important is to

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,880
make the project feel welcoming

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,640
and not to count on the fact that

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,160
people will push through if they have

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,000
enough energy to fight through your

00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,520
barriers as a maintainer because only

00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,119
then a certain kinds of people will

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,160
actually push through the defenses and

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,119
then the

00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,280
um the types of people involved in the

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,000
project would be like very uniform and i

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,359
i value diversity a lot so i feel that

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,359
a project on its face which is often

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,119
most the primary phase of a project on

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,359
github is maybe it's readme

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,280
and its official site and this

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,079
description and tags and things like

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,559
that

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,920
so often it's worth to step back and see

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,599
how the

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,599
the first surface of the project might

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,400
be perceived from outsiders and how we

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,680
can

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,720
signal the fact that um maybe the

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,520
project is

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,559
more than just what meets the eye or

00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,960
maybe the project

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,800
needs more help than what it appears and

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,599
from different kinds of people

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,319
so i would suggest often taking a step

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,440
back and

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,359
and and really

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,800
reevaluating how welcoming of the

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,280
project it is

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,040
but that may be is only valid for

00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,079
existing project that only gains some

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,440
tractions for new

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,040
ones i would say that the most important

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,960
thing would be

00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:09,520
to just really focus on solving

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:12,800
your initial idea well and then to

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,520
find ways to get people on board

00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,839
with the idea and that that part is like

00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,520
the

00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,599
organic growth of the project that part

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,960
is the hardest because i feel that

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,440
a lot of people are thinking oh my

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,079
project is not getting so much

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,839
um stars or attention or something like

00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,640
that but that is the hardest part and

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:34,319
sometimes that part is really hard to

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,760
uh hard to emulate the success of

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,760
another project or

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,359
it's hard to really force if it's not

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,559
really happening by itself

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,000
and i feel that um if the project is

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,599
really

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,960
something that solves an itch and

00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,960
that souls image in a way that is also

00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,640
communicates that really well and is

00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,359
transparent about what it's doing it's

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,920
going to be much

00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,200
easier than for others to discover it

00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,640
and

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,520
to start get going with it

00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,319
as well so it's not really a competition

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,440
in this

00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:11,359
in a sense of a market as in like

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,119
an economy opens this project but it's a

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,599
competition in the sense of

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,119
how we can be more approachable and

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,319
eventually the kind of frameworks and

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,880
libraries and

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,440
all sorts of other open source projects

00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,680
are

00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,559
going to be always more approachable if

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,079
they

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,319
um lower the barriers of entry

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,599
and if they improve documentation and if

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,599
they

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
are committed to nurturing a

00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,920
relationship

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,720
with a community uh and nurturing trust

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,400
from people

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,920
because i think fundamentally it's all

00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,440
about trust when we download other

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,839
people's

00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,200
code from the internet and executing on

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,119
my machines that's

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,880
a very vulnerable interesting thing to

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,880
do so i feel that

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,079
as open source maintainers we need to

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,799
recognize that

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,000
how much people are potentially going to

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,640
put trust in that

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,280
and really do the work to go and meet

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,359
them

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,520
in that way that's where it's like any

00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:07,359
startup right like you can't just

00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,799
you know build the thing and then hope

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,240
people come you've got to solve the

00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,280
problem you've got to market it in the

00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,799
right way you've got to attract the

00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,720
right people to come to

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,480
the project and just start using it

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,119
right and like you said it's a

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,440
a lot is around trust you know whether

00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,440
it's if you're building a product people

00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,359
you know download or people take that

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,920
product and trust that it's gonna work

00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,079
if it's

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,520
open source software as you said people

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,880
download that product they don't just

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,920
trust that it's going to work with it

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,760
they're trusting

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,599
that you're not going to you know break

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,359
anything else that they've got going on

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,880
as well right so i think you know those

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,359
are such important things and you know

00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,799
this is

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,200
many of those people listening into the

00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,000
chat this is like the goal that you need

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,640
to be listening

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,599
to right now this like these tips are

00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,200
just like

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,640
what you want i remember someone saying

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,960
to me like um

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,000
talking to mentors or people who have

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,079
done it before

00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
is the only legitimate form of time

00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,760
travel so we're getting all the

00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,079
knowledge and experience you have

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,680
from you know your work in open source

00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,119
over the last 10 years and

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,960
working projects and maintaining

00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,960
projects um

00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,240
it's just so valuable to have and to

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,079
hear from you so

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,599
i just wonder if there's any last-minute

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,280
thoughts you wanted to

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,680
put out to the community or anything

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,520
else you'd like to say before we

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,040
sign everyone off for the night or the

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:27,359
evening or after the morning wherever

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:30,720
you're tuning in from

00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:32,400
well i would say for since it

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,599
sounds like a lot of people are really

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,799
interested in the world of open source

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,839
and i would say that

00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:44,240
the most just important

00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,599
thing to keep in mind is that this was

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,200
all built

00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,040
based on people's kind of input

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,880
and their energy that they really put

00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,480
and i would say maybe the source of that

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,400
energy was their love for whatever

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,920
they're creating or the the problems

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,640
that they're solving

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,520
and that effectively being a part of

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,559
that is also

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:06,720
understanding it and figuring out

00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,000
what do you also have to contribute with

00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,040
where does their energy come

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,160
from and and what motivates you

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:16,720
and i feel that the rest is gonna fall

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,319
like domino's after that initial

00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,799
figuring out that initial

00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:26,400
thing the initial motivation and um the

00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,839
single most important skill in in what

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,760
people like me are doing i would say

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,559
that it's just persistence

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,920
and sometimes it is hard but sometimes

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,079
we're faced with the stack trace and

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,000
we're looking at it there's no uh

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,680
rhyme or reason to it but i would say

00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,440
that persistence is the most important

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,440
skill and that is also in contributing

00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,160
and that is also in maintaining

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,520
and um it needs a lot of energy and

00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,280
sometimes it's hard but i would

00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,839
definitely encourage everyone to keep

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,520
up with it because what's on the other

00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,319
side is a lot of connection

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,359
and a lot of creation and um we didn't

00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,359
get to enjoy the

00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,480
the tools that we use and use them for

00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,319
great things

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,400
definitely i think you you started touch

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,359
show before too but people just need to

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,680
understand that

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,760
whatever kind of skill level they have

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,680
and whatever kind of

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,280
programming language or anything like

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,839
that that you've got

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,480
you your skills will be valuable to open

00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,319
source

00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,200
so don't ever think that you're not good

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:22,720
enough or that you know you can't learn

00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,319
as well or you can't learn from the

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,839
people around you you know a lot of the

00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,799
streams have been talked about people

00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:31,040
like miss lab and the maintainers here

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,400
are saying you know come along and you

00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,640
know they'll help you

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,680
get through what you're trying to get

00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,520
through and you know

00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,880
build better issues and things like that

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,000
and write better codes so

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,119
this is what i love about the open

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,480
source community right it's just

00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,400
everyone coming in and

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,480
helping one another out and you know

00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,400
supporting one another and so i think

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,760
you know what the key things you said

00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,240
were amazing which was

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,760
you know if you are a maintainer you

00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,359
know think about how to make your

00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,119
project welcoming

00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:59,359
get people involved you know build a

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,400
culture that is diverse rather than just

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,520
one-sided

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,880
you know if you're thinking about

01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,240
contributing you know block up the

01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,640
courage to contribute

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,079
and then find a project to contribute to

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,599
you know hopefully it's something that

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,280
you're already using

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,880
and then once you've you've got then you

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,559
start contributing to that project don't

01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,760
get disheartened if your full request

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,680
