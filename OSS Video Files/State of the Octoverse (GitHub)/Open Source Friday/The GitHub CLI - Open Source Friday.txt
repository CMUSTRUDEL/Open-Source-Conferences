Title: The GitHub CLI - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2020-10-12
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 9th October 2020, 5pm AEDT. We interviewed Mislav MarohniÄ‡ from the newly launched GitHub CLI. We talked all about Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Mislav has been in the Open Source community and working as a maintainer for over 10 years so he has lots of words of wisdom.
