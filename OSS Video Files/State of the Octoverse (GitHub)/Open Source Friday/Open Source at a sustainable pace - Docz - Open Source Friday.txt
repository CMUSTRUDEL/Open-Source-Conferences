and i'm i'm always working as a frontier

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,280
but in 2004 uh 2014

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,320
i knew react in a talk i was

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,680
working with angler at the time and

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,560
angular was a little bit tricky

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
and a little bit there's a lot there was

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,320
a lot of be

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,600
messy around angular 1.

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,200
1.0 at that time and uh

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,799
a guy that's like a lot uh

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,840
to be some uh some kind of architecture

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,680
you know just a guy uh operate

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,200
things so when i saw reactive rectus

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,479
uh something very very awesome

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,320
for me uh and

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,399
i'm created i'm the creator of doxy uh

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,520
in doxie came to to be alive because of

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,720
uh reacting and all

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,439
these component-based uh

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,560
searchers that he have react to have so

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,840
i think that my journey uh

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,200
until here is very uh

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,600
working with react a lot and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
and trying to to be part of the

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,520
community i really love

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,120
uh to be part and contribute to the

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,840
community

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
excellent and this is a beautiful site

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,959
uh i did see

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,599
gatsby here as well um as

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,040
being powered so this is a a framework

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,560
for folks to

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,040
build docs for their site uh

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
yeah uh doxy is is sometime the tool to

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,200
[Music]

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,239
make easy for you to document your

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
things and when i talk about things i'm

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
talking about

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,959
when you have an open source project and

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,720
you want to create some kind of

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,040
documentation for it

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,000
or when you have some kind of design

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
system

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
doxy is a very good tool to

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
create some kind of easy and quick

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
documentation

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
we know it as a little bit hard to start

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
a project

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
set up a lot of things and and create

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,959
type of

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,920
stuff uh in front-end setup

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
things is i think is the hard part of

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,519
the

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
the work now we have a lot of tools to

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,519
help us

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,200
with that next yes is one of them that's

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:27,040
got to be another one but i'm

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,599
a little bit old and i'm

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
at my time was very hard to set up

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
things we

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,760
spent more time setupping the project

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,120
than

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,480
working on it and web pack was very hard

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,440
but now there's a lot of tools to help

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
and doxy is one of them a tool that will

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
help you to have

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,159
some kind of playing ground for your

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,920
components some kind of

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,599
uh easy and quick documentation

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,599
yeah and in the chat vortex has

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,959
mentioned that doxy for folks who are

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,760
familiar with jekyll

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
uh it does a great job of like it's

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,480
fixing that

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,720
extending the it wouldn't get a pages in

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,319
jekyll it combines pretty well a lot of

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,159
people leverage that for their docs

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
it seems like an evolution to that that

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,040
solution

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,799
yeah of course jq is a very good tool uh

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,199
i'm working with it a long time ago

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,519
excellent and uh remind me where in

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,720
brazil are you based

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,080
uh i am the uh near a city

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,240
uh called florianopolis in the south

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,919
yeah in the south of the country santa

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,880

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
actually one of the contributors from

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
one of my projects

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
they mentioned you in my tweet uh and

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
was like hey

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
you should connect with pedro uh and

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,960
it came out with this issue right here

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
which this issue you created eight days

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
ago

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
um i would love to hear the story behind

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
this issue

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,199
uh and sort of how you got here and what

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,320
was the response after you opened it

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,360
yeah of course uh i i'm really uh

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
didn't have idea when i uh posted this

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,720
issue that

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,360
will uh sound so loud to the community

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
uh was something that i made in uh in

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
the middle of the night

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,600
because uh the last years

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,479
the last year uh was a little bit tough

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
for

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,000
everyone because dynamically all of this

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
stuff

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,800
but when i started to work with uh doxie

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,199
uh was something very uh

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
it's it's kind of passion for me because

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,680
uh

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,440
i'm started to work here with react uh

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:11,600
six years ago and i always had

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,680
the the idea science i i knew react

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,440
to create uh two like doxy because

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,080
i saw oh uh here we have very good

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,280
way to create our component or our

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,319
structure

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,039
and we need a tool for that so

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
at the time i'm working a lot of time

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,039
with storybook

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,199
and at the time starbuck was

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
a little bit tricky and a little bit

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
slow as well

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,280
had some problems and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,720
i really wanted to create a tool

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,520
and was just for fun was just for

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,039
something that i really liked it and

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,599
and wanted to and i started to work a

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,479
lot

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,520
uh i wake up on wednesday happening

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,759
three hours

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
earlier and going to the back three

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,440
hours later just to

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,720
be able to code in the project and

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,360
in the middle of the the process and i

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
think that

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
that is the very good part of open

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
source you can

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,280
erase all the code and make it

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,880
uh again in the middle of the process

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,120
uh i i remembered uh

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,639
the guys from xjs launched mdx

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,720
so i already almost the entire code that

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,479
i'm writing at that time and started to

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,680
to code again to put mdx in doxy

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,479
because when i when i saw uh i talked

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
for myself

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:51,440
oh this will be a game changer for

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,759
for doxie and in fact it was

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,879
was a very game changer because i was in

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,240
a trip

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,800
uh with my wife and i was with

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
all the things prepared to make the the

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,560
launch of the project

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,560
but uh i never never never thought that

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,000
will be something so big and

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,680
we'll have had so many people's uh

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,039
people liking and sharing the project so

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,599
when i posted the the video uh in the

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,479
tweet i had a a

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,960
a small video with a quick and very

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,400
quick

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:34,000
and easy just uh showing how

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,680
doxy worked and when i posted this video

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,080
was some kind of a boom in the in the

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,360
community because

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,760
in the first day it

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
had

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,320
15 or 16 000 stars just in

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,600
in one day was sometimes saved because

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,880
guys from zeid started to share the

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,920
the tweet uh matthews cairo from gatsby

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,120
uh shared as well kenzi does uh dan

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,279
abramov

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,279
shared when they shared the project the

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,120
project

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,240
make an explosion and a lot of the men

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,760
start to to growing with the doxy

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,040
and be able to uh make a conciliation

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,399
between your

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,959
work in open source is something very

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
hard

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,519
very very hard because

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,279
open source gets a long time

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,399
in your day just to respond

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,959
issues and get demands from people and

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,160
and thinking the road map of the project

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,360
and thinking

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
and all this stuff around a good open

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,320
source project

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
and you have people all day uh creating

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
issues for

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,519
for the project and people think that

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,720
uh you kind of

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:03,920
need to to resolve their

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
issues and sometimes they uh they want

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,360
to

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,920
the the fix of the issue in in the same

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
day

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,399
and and be a little bit angry if you

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,839
don't respond it this is very uh

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
is something that starts to consume

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,440
yourself

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,560
so i was very fat i'm

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,399
i was with 30 pounds

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,279
more than i have today and

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,079
very stressed i'm was fighting a lot

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
with my wife

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,000
because you know you need time for for

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,000
our wives

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,680
and and i was just in coding

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,360
all day and in the weekends so i got it

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,399
very fat and a time

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,920
i needed to to stop and thinking myself

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,959
and when i saw uh will be hard

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,120
or i maintain my work

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:06,079
18 hours per day and strike and try to

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,360
start to to improve my healthy

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,880
or uh i'm trying to to

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,839
keep going in doxy and this was very

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,360
hard for me because

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:23,519
after launch doxy with gatsby

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,160
was a massive revamp of the project

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
and gets me supported me with that but

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,959
after

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
this uh reconfiguration of the project

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,560
was a little bit hard because start to

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,839
uh

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,560
growing a lot of demands and i'm trying

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,800
to

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,600
get a sponsor with some companies

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
uh i'm starting to to get sponsored with

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,880
uh

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
some guys and people that i know that

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
are used

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,079
that was using doxie but uh was very

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,000
hard so

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,720
i lost the motivation because i thought

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,160
i'm just in coding for everyone and

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
making a very good job

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:10,000
and didn't have uh one people that can

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,279
uh gave just 10 bucks a month

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,920
this is very awkward for me so

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,920
i'm i'm

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,160
my motivation was a loss that's the

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
the right thing to say my motivation was

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,120
lasted and

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,240
i'm started to focus on my health

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,760
and so uh i didn't more

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,120
time to working on both my work

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,839
and my health and doxy so i needed to

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
choose

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,839
and uh i chose myself yeah

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,720
cool and that kind of summarizes what

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
was mentioned

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,720
in your um in your issue as well that

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,399
you opened up last week

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,920
being able to focus on yourself which is

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,160
important mental health

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,480
uh when it comes to like writing code is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,000
it's a mentally taxing thing where you

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
have to think through problems and

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,480
solutions

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,920
but to do that for um

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
i'll go ahead and start the repo too as

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
well but do that for 20 000 people

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
per se that are watching this not to

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,399
mention the people that are using it

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
um that number could be higher or lower

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,959
um

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
it's it's admirable that you you did

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
take make that decision to say okay

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,320
we're going to

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,800
do something different um which i'm

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,120
curious in the response to this like

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,720
i don't see many internal issues at

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,120
github that get this much

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,639
this many reactions so can you talk

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
about the reaction to the issue when you

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,320
sort of just said hey

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
sorry not so much effort has been put in

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
the project

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
as of late um what was the what was the

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
response that you

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,000
you received yeah uh

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,680
was something uh very impressive for me

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,560
and uh

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
uh i'm very surprised until now because

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,720
uh

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:02,000
in fact as i mentioned in the issue

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,639
every day that i can't work in

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
the project was something very hard for

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,720
me because

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,160
i was thinking a lot about hey i needed

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
to start to

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,440
work in doxy doxy was

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,480
will die if i don't work on it

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,360
and this was hurt me a lot but

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
i have a lot of troubles in things to

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,040
manage

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,320
so this year a lot of good things

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,760
uh happening with me uh i'm very

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,959
very good now in terms of a healthy uh

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,240
mental and physical uh mainly

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:46,320
physical because uh i think that

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,839
developers uh are very worried about

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,040
mental healthy and and

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,560
have a good code and a lot of things but

00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,399
developers in in general

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,680
uh they forgot to to keep

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,480
and and care about healthy

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
and have a lot of troubles with healthy

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
so

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
i started to

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,639
be more careful with my healthy and

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,079
improve it it's a lot so

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,399
when i saw the reaction of the the guys

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,040
and

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,160
a lot of things a lot of people

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,279
supporting me

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,399
uh because the history i thought i

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,519
have a lot of people with the same

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,240
uh passing the same thing uh

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,040
i i think they have a lot of open source

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
guys

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,480
that uh especially uh uh

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
in the same situation i think they have

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,519
a lot of developer

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,000
uh having the same situation uh maybe

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,680
with mental healthy or maybe with

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,199
physical healthy we eat and when as

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,920
uh i see something like that i see that

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,800
uh we need more people talking about

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,320
this

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,920
we need more people talking about hey

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,279
companies uh you don't need just to

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,839
worry about your money or

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,360
how much you are growing but you need to

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,160
start to think that

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,519
your software is built around open

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,480
source tools

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
so you need to give back to open source

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,800
because

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,399
companies uh i i a lot of companies

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,639
don't have the idea that

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,759
uh open source is something free and

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,720
i think that they just ah

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
we're just using this this tool that my

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,920
guy my developer

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,199
says that we needed to use but they

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,839
they don't have any worry about uh oh

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,519
this project is a free project and

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,800
we are using it so we are giving back

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,240
to it so uh i think that

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,720
uh people need to start to to talk about

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
this

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,919
and they need to start to

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,640
talk to companies that hey your software

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
is built

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
around open source you need to give back

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,559
to the community

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,559
yeah yeah and it it looks like that you

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,799
you also announced uh this week so this

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,919
has been a very fast week for yeah

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,600
uh but you do have uh connected github

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,480
sponsors to your your product too so

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,120
folks can

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,640
contribute uh and help sort of support

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,400
your work

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,520
yeah sure uh one or two days after

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,039
i posted the issue and

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,760
started the buzzy uh and it was

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,880
uh i think very surprised because hype

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,280
it a lot

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
there's so many people who had to eat in

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,320
the project and

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,960
i had more than 100

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,960
000 uh impressions in in the tweet

00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,000
and two days after github contact me

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,679
and says oh pedro you will be the

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,280
second person in brazil to be part of

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,080
the sponsor program

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,880
and this was very awesome for me because

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,919
i know that github is helping a lot with

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,360
that and it's very good to see

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,360
to have a company

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,400
thinking about the the front-end the

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,440
the community the open source and trying

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,000
to to put this to another people

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
yeah excellent well i'm i'm happy to

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
hear that
