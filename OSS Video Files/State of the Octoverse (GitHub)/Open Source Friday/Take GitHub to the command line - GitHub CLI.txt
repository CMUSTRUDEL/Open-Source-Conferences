here maybe the first time you actually

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,400
sort of strolled through either twitter

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
or a meetup page

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,599
uh this is open source friday and uh

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,599
it's an opportunity to talk to

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,400
maintainers and learn how open source

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
works

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,080
um or how what how open source doesn't

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,160
work too as well

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,920
we're happy to have both conversations

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,160
and um if you are

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,439
in the chat to say hello um definitely

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
give us a wave

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,119
um tell us how you learned about this uh

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,039
the stream

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,559
also if you've been here before just uh

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
give us a shout out and say

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,160
you know i came in for this project or i

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,360
came in for this other stream

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,399
um but nate uh do you want to give us

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,920
like an introduction of

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
who you are and what you do and uh what

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,000
project you're working on

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,000
sure yeah um uh so

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
uh my name is nate uh everywhere online

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
i'm building a bim

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,879
um i usually say my name is film a bim i

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,239
just play an avatar called nate

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,719
elsewhere um but i i work for github

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,720
i've worked there for almost three years

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,760
um and i work on gh so

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,400
gh is the command line version of

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,640
github.com

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
excellent and uh it sounds like uh the

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
notification was in spanish too as well

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
i totally forgot to change that

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
uh we had the octogothos conf so it was

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,799
a conference in espanol

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
um so if anybody was was uh confused on

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
why that was in spanish and they didn't

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
understand it

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,479
there you go um this present ten day

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,920
is uh uh going to be presented in

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
english

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
that was horrible but uh we'll we'll

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
move on

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,200
to it um i know i know a bit of spanish

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,840
but not

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,040
not great um oh yeah you've actually um

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
you actually started to get around the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
same time we just learned that before we

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
went live

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,479
uh and you've been working so you

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,799
haven't always been working on the cli

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
then

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
you were we working on before oh it's

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,680
super exciting

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
uh well so before github i worked for

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
venmo

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,360
uh oh nice it just happened by accident

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,040
kind of like i i wanted

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
three trips to new york and i was like

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
one of the python companies in new york

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,640
so ended up at venmo

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
uh but then that puts the the taint of

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
fintech

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,599
on your resume yeah and so when i was

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,720
looking for a new job

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,360
uh my girlfriend is actually a hover um

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
she's been here um almost four years oh

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
cool uh and i was just getting jealous i

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
was like wow it looks like a pretty

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,599
sweet place to work i've been

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
a user of github forever and they had an

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,840
opening for billing

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,080
so um so yeah so you know thanks to the

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,720
finances

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
i got a job uh doing uh working on

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,319
payments

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,519
um like enterprise side of payments

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,800
um and uh yeah but when you know when

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,800
the cli team

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
got formed like the second i heard about

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
it i was like like this is the team that

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,959
i

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,519
i want to be on um so i went to the

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
manager and just kind of showed her all

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
of my

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,879
my adventures in the terminal that i go

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,519
on and here i am now

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,640
awesome cool yeah that's one of the

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,920
programming things there's two things i

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
don't want to do in programming one's

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,080
time zones and the other one is billing

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640
um i've had experience of both of them

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
and i've sworn them off so if i have to

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,159
touch you know the braintree api or

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
other things like i'm just like you know

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
what

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
uh i'm gonna either offload this to

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
somebody else

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,080
or like politely bow out but um

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
definitely definitely a hard problem

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
and i totally get the whole um

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,840
containing your resume with the with the

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,360
finance

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,080
fintech uh definitely a thing you get

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
sort of

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
sort of like typecasting and when it

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,480
comes to like movie stars

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
you've escaped though you're not working

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,120
on a nice cool open source tool

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,239
uh which is gh i'm a lot happier yeah

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,080
definitely

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,480
uh i'm curious though your background uh

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,760
is in python then

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,120
uh it's yeah it's kind of all over um

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
i you know i've been doing programming

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
for

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,159
like probably 12 12 years or something

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
like that

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,920
uh i've like by the bulk of my code has

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,959
been python um

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,159
but for jobs it's been a been a really

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,040
weird like a weird mix

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,799
my career started in pearl um you know

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,519
so i have a big big soft spot for pearl

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,440
still

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,560
uh i've done closure ruby um

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
java all sorts of stuff but yeah outside

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
of work it was pretty much python for

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,600
for a long time i had a weird

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
like couple of years the javascript

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,759
person

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
um and uh now actually because of gh

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
i've gotten really into go

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
so i've been like porting all of my side

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,880
stuff in the go and it's been all fun

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
nice so you're you're is that your first

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,320
experience though with go

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,199
is from uh this project

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,919
pretty my first like you know real

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,880
experience

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,120
um i had started a a project and go

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,040
well i tried to learn rust like a couple

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,280
years ago and it went terribly and i was

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,280
like well i'll fail and to go

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,320
and so i was already learning it when i

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
heard about this team

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
um but i had only done like some toy

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
projects and really small stuff so this

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
is my first like you know actual

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,400
project and go okay awesome uh

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,320
i i've always been interested in go um

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,240
ironically my last job i interviewed and

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
go but when i got there i wrote only

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
javascript

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
um so it's a it's a it's a story i tell

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
all the time

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,560
but yeah that's my i've always like been

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
tangential to go projects so when i saw

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
the cli

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,919
was written in go and i was using it for

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
my own streams i used the cli

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,960
um had an opportunity for a feature and

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
then saw it was written and go i'm like

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,639
oh this is awesome i can actually

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,720
use the all the knowledge i do which i

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,560
joke i learned go once a year

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,560
um just to keep up the up to speed

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
i i've been really happy with it it's

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
like uh moving

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,560
i don't know for whatever reason i found

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
it really weirdly intuitive and the

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
parts about it that were weird

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,319
i got really used to it now i really

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,080
appreciate and it's just been great i

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,440
i'm i'm so happy i don't have to think

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
about virtual environments

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,000
and packaging and python versions and

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
i didn't expect that to be one of my

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
favorite things but uh

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
it's really cool to be like i can write

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,880
a little script compile it and i just

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
have that now i don't have to like do

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
maintenance on my little scripts you

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
know which is what has

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
been happening over the years with my

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,840
python stuff

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
all right so we're getting uh some

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
comments about the

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
the buffering and the lagging i just

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
lowered the bitrate so hopefully that

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
sort of gives us a little more space and

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,680
lowers the lag

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,039
i apologize for folks who are not

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
getting the best experience

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
uh perhaps you're on the twitch is not

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,759
leveraging the local aws server for them

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,199
um disable low latency mode

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,720
that is something that i

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
definitely don't know how to do um

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
but i will say the recording will be on

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
on youtube so if you cannot stick around

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
for this

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
um do the buffering uh feel free to

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
check it out on the youtube and we'll

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
still continue to power through

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,400
it's uh you know we're doing it live uh

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
so speaking of live

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
i can switch to the the share and we can

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,360
actually jump into the project and talk

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,560
about what we actually been sort of

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,560
alluding to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,880
which is the uh the actual cli itself so

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
we had a big release uh was it uh last

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
week or the week before

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,080
oh my god time is incredibly meaningless

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,160
uh

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,800
two weeks ago was the big 1.0 yeah

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
yeah and uh so do you want to give like

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
uh we can give like a brief overview of

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,840
like what the cli is and like

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
why it exists yeah sure um

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,360
i mean the way that i describe it is

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,400
it's it's a port of github

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
uh you know like between video game

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,919
consoles kind of it's we have it on the

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,639
web and now we have it in the terminal

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,160
so

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,400
it's it's more than just um like an api

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,000
wrapper um i know there's a lot of there

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
are many really cool projects

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,440
um out there that just kind of like wrap

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,599
all the api endpoints um so this does a

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,160
lot more than that it like tries to

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,800
take a whole entire like github

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
workflows

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,639
and and present them in an intuitive way

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
um and in a way that like we hope

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
reduces

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
context switching um you don't have to

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
like switch from your code

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,800
to your browser um as often if you're

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,400
using gh is the hope um

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
and don't know just like to provide an

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
experience that is just feels

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,039
comfortable for people that like to be

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,560
in the terminal and are already there

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,760
most of their day so what is uh

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,640
i guess what's the difference between

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,479
this and the

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,479
uh the regular git cli

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
so it's they're they're pretty different

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,800
um

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,000
uh you know get like we we intentionally

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,279
don't try to replace git

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,320
ever so we call git for you uh

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,519
to do things you know like

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,880
getting commit logs uh pushing branches

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,560
stuff like that it's like we call git

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,480
but we don't ever try to replace a git

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,720
command so like gh is is kind of

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
it's it's like a i don't want to use the

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
word successor because we're not trying

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,920
to replace this other project but

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
there's an existing project called hub

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
that is an open source project

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,600
very pretty similar to gh and it's the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,519
same person

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
is kind of behind both uh my co-worker

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,800
mieslav um

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
has been in charge of hub now works on

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,720
gh um

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
and what he kind of learned over there

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
is like hub really tries to replace

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,200
git and like you know let you call hub

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,480
instead of get and then it'll add a

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
bunch of github stuff to

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
to get and he just he found that to be

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,040
really difficult to maintain

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,600
and so like you know gh is just github

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
and git is just get uh sometimes we

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
might call it to get but we're never

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,240
gonna replace git you're always still

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
gonna call git to do low-level things

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,519
like

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,360
stage files commit files create branches

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,000
stuff like that

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,000
okay cool yeah so that is that and um

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
i'm a big fan of the the cli too well it

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,760
gets it gives a lot of like context

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,839
um for just operating with with the

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
github itself like github.com

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
uh i also use hub back in the day so

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
being able to create repos from the

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,279
command line without doing this sort of

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
dance

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,680
of going to the ui creating the url

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,360
or the repo and then i guess

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,959
pushing that branch up into there like

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,600
there's always that awkwardness

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
of trying to teach people github or yeah

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
just

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
teach github and teach them what a repo

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
is

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
open a repo and then there's nothing

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
there and then they have to go and

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
go to this magical place which is the

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
terminal so

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
consistency being consistent on how you

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
can approach teaching it

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,440
is helpful um speaking of consistency it

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,120
looks like the lag is

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
improved i think the bit rate might have

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,560
been the fix um

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,040
so everybody yeah go ahead

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
oh i might be quiet also i can uh i can

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
yell if that's helpful

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
oh i can actually bump you up your

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
volumes here as well uh which is not a

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,760
problem

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,399
um and i can lower myself down yeah hey

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,000
feedback

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
live feedback this is how open source

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,279
works uh

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
like what you see i'm actually doing the

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,399
mixing i'm doing the streaming

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,680
and uh this is all bootstrap for us so

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,839
happy everybody's stuck around and

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,480
giving us a hawaii feedback as well

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,680
uh but speaking of live feedback uh i

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
wouldn't actually talk about the project

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,839
itself so this is

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,200
you're more than welcome to uh gh garden

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,160
is fun actually i'm not sure about that

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
command

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
what is uh

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,640
it's uh i moved it to gh repo garden

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,880
um it's also i i want to give the caviar

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
it's

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
it's an easter egg that i added uh to gh

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,279
um

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,480
it's it's broken in 1.0 for like

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,360
a lot of repositories yeah if it's fixed

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,360
and trunk so

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
it'll be out in the next release but uh

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,240
it's if you run it it'll take your

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,720
repository

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
and drop you into kind of like a a

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
roguelike

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
uh environment where you you the

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,160
repository is rendered as a big garden

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,200
uh and so all the commits or flowers and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,399
there's just a couple of

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,079
cute details and uh yeah i did it we

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,360
have hack days on our team and i i

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,639
wanted to like

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,320
explore being like in a repo like

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,760
like what if the repository was a space

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
and like what would that space look like

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
and so

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,680
yeah that was my little attempt at that

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
and

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,880
uh yeah if you run it against the repo

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,480
with enough commits

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,360
should work i am for some reason my

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
terminal was

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
dying on me so i had to open up a new

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,839
one

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
but i think i have one that i can test

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,880
out

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,639
uh i'm just curious because i've not

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,519
seen that but also i haven't been

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,839
watching the uh

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
the commits like a hawk at all so gh

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,360
repo garden

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,000
yeah we'll see if it crashes

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,600
i also have not updated it as well uh

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,279
updated

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,639
oh if you're not at 1.0 it might not be

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
in there then

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,160
oh no oh i'm definitely a 1.0 okay

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
you're in there

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
uh so oh man so this is a fun bug um so

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,760
i'm using

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,600
uh rgb color and yeah if for some reason

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760
whatever i'm doing this might have been

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,120
fixed but those letters aren't supposed

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,880
to be blinking um

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
it's something to do with mac i i

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
develop on linux like exclusively so

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,680
like

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
i had this kind of stuff i have to do

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,079
like some low-level

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,839
uh escape code stuff and that's not

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,440
always super consistent and then yeah

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,959
something about when i switched to using

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
the rgb

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,880
um escape codes it leads to this

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
blinking i don't know what the hell i

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,480
did

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,279
on the mac because it doesn't fit on

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
linux so it's a lot prettier on linux i

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,600
i

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
i i think but if you can walk around

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,440
with wads um

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,519
this should be able to yeah oh and

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
yeah there are watts okay yeah yeah so

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
you can wander around and then

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
you know it tells you what you're

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,800
looking at so every flower is

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,399
every flower is a commit and so it tells

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,320
you who made it and then

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
so the color is supposed to be a

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,120
derivation out of the hash

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,600
um nice this is my favorite committer

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
dependibot right there

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
it needs it needs the box flag like you

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
added for credits yeah

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,040
i mean everybody i would say the last

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
month is nothing but dependable because

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,160
i've shipped zero features to

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,240
my project um yeah so it's all depend

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,279
about who's contributed

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
but that's pretty cool i'm actually

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,399
going to play with it and i can get a

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,959
linux environment not now but i'll do

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,920
that later

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,279
to see what the uh what the author had

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,760
in mind and envisioned

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,639
yeah i have a mac somewhere in my house

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,160
i can

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,600
try to fix it hey there's some one of

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
the terminologies i think it looks fine

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
and not much

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,000
or something maybe i'm just uh dreaming

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,199
but

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,120
um yeah i know yeah so that's

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,199
i i'm you know i've got two little

00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,399
hidden commands like that in gh i'm

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,399
hoping to add plenty more cool

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,839
yeah well i'll i honestly i need to

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
actually just watch this repo

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
because i don't mind getting the uh

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,240
notifications for this since i

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,600
am now a committer on it um but i just

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
want to talk about the sort of

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
the approach to the project too as well

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,320
like folks can look up all the commands

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
and check out the documentation

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
and how to use it uh but i want to

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,519
understand the approach um

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,040
so one uh why go why was that the choice

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,040
when like there are a lot of other tools

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,800
you can use to create clies

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
uh and actually let's just start with

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,440
that like what was the decision

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,920
behind uh choosing go in cobra

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,360
yeah so i mean so i mentioned hub and

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,199
when we started this team on day one

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
it wasn't like oh we're just going to

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,120
make something new like we really like

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
are we going to just maintain hope are

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
we going to maybe

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,199
change hope drastically are we going to

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,320
make something new we didn't really know

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,560
and we talked about it a lot uh so when

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,399
we

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
when we did decide finally for a bunch

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
of reasons uh let's let's just make

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,959
something new

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,519
um you know mieslav had pointed out like

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
well hub

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,600
had been in ruby for a long time that

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
led to some performance

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,880
and packaging problems a community

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
member just

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
offered a full rewrite and go and misal

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
just took it

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,600
and was like pretty happy with the

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,399
result and so

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,279
he had that positive experience i was

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,040
really interested

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
from mainly from a packaging standpoint

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
like i i just

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,880
i we wanted this tool to be available to

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,040
people in as many places as possible

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,040
and to just be able to do

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
cross-compilation and release binaries

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
and then

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
we really wanted that that nice

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,920
experience and i have been using enough

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,440
um there's a bunch of nice go commands

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,079
like uh like micro as a cool little

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,279
editor

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,399
yeah um and some other stuff and i love

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,079
again like when you're talking about a

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,839
programming language it feels weird to

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
talk about how great it is to release

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,959
but but i really feel that like

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,320
compiling and

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,800
shipping go is a breeze it's so nice uh

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
it's so much easier than compiling c

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,440
plus plus

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,760
and it's so much easier than packaging

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,240
and shipping ruby or python so

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,720
that was like a really big sell um and

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,720
then performance like we're trying to

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,799
you know tell people hey you should use

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
this all day like you're a programmer

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,839
you're going to be using this tool a lot

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,280
if you're going to use it we don't want

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,240
it to be slow so

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,919
we set a pretty um a pretty high bar for

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,959
ourselves in terms of what

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,880
what is you know how fast it should go i

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,240
i think some of the commands we could

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
actually even go faster

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,919
we're trying to we're fighting mostly

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
network latency but

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,039
uh yeah so that was another huge reason

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
to go to

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,760
go with go nice yeah and like the

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,440
when you say you're fighting network

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
latency maybe i have a nice network

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,039
outside of streaming and getting

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,919
buffering but uh like just

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,280
i've done i've used the gh for cloning

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,600
forked repos

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
and just getting the context of the repo

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
to my command line

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
really quickly uh it seemed like very

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
fast

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,480
like faster than actual get cloning um

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,360
so i've been oppressed

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,160
so far we're just calling good clown

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
under the hood

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,520
yeah there's no magic there okay maybe

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,039
there's no magic yeah

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,799
i think i think conceptually it feels

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,799
faster because you just get the type

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,640
gh reboot clone yeah you don't have to

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,880
grab the url you know food

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
yeah so like it always feels faster but

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,360
um but yeah

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,640
it's um yeah some some of the stuff

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,880
around like uh pull request listing um

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
commit log polling that can be a little

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
bit slow just from networking

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
stuff sometimes but yeah it's not so bad

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
yeah and like the

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,280
the one thing that i even noticed too as

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
well because like um i

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,039
i think i joked on stream i'm sure if i

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,840
record if it was on the recording but

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,120
um i've always learned go i joke that i

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
wouldn't go once a year

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,320
um because i don't really have like an

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
actual product

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,679
project that i'm working on or like

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,799
something i do at work um

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,120
so even doing my commit which i think

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,000
oh you know i did assignee i wanted to

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
find mike

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
my pr uh because i actually did a pr a

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,520
couple weeks ago

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,640
um uh assignee b dougie okay let's

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
delete this

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,679
uh but what i was getting at is like

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
understanding how to actually run the

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,320
build locally

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,320
is something i always have to look up

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
with like uh with like javascript

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,280
projects

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,280
uh and node because there are very

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
different ways to approach that problem

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,880
um and it's just like not consistent as

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,720
far as when it goes to

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
javascript projects but like with go

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,200
with the binaries built

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
directly into the the i guess is it is

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
it built in the standard library

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,400
i believe so um it was a breeze actually

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,799
run

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
to see my changes working like

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,559
immediately once i did i wrote the code

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,679
um which was nice go with go yeah

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,880
i'm a big fan of that also um yeah and

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
like you know we can talk like the

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
language itself there's a bunch of stuff

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,679
i like about

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
the actual language but yeah i'm super

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,520
relieved i think

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,520
these days it's it's like kind of a

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,520
no-brainer that you want

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,080
you want to think holistically about the

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,760
whole practice of programming and like

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,960
a programmer's task isn't just

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
programming like you have to have

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
development environments and releasing

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
and like

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
yeah see i i appreciate that um and it's

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
it's you know i i would say it's really

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,799
worked out

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,520
for us um yeah i've been

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,200
been happy with the development for gh

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,200
for sure

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,960
i had one question and i want to jump

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
into the contributing md and talk about

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
that a little quick

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
uh but my first question is why is the

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,640
contributing the not in the root

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,760
and it's under the dot github folder is

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,799
there a special reason for that

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,520
uh i have no idea

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,679
so somebody put it there yeah i think uh

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,039
somebody at github that um

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,880
is involved with uh open source

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
you know making sure that we do things

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
correctly that's i think that's where

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
they put it so

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,880
i i think this appears magically

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,799
somewhere in the github ui

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,880
but i i'm not actually sure yeah it's

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,120
supposed to show up here

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,520
on the right which i think if i am

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
correct

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,520
it's not there anymore it might be in

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,080
the in the insights there's a really

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,200
cool

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,360
uh feature uh that i like the community

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
yeah the community insights page yeah

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
it's really cool

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,559
there it is yeah so this just tells you

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
um

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,320
yeah it'll link it there so i think that

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,360
we put it in the github to

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,039
uh make it show up here okay yeah

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
because i know uh like even my projects

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,760
i put in the root and when i went to

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,720
contribute to this project

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,640
i was like oh they don't have a

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,679
contributing md and then i found it by

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
searching

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
uh which is people don't know you can

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,559
hit t uh and on the root of the project

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
and search

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
uh which i've shown that before a couple

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,039
times uh you all need a pull request

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,679
template

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,240
you'd be 100 complete we have them i

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,600
don't know

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,640
why we're getting a a yellow on that

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,880
yeah they're in there if you look in uh

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,080
oh there it is uh maybe it's just it's

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,200
the structure

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,840
uh maybe uh because you have you have

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,760
it's uh in a

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
folder anyway you could talk to github

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,720
about that

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,159
uh anyway i was just i was just curious

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
because i know i noticed actually all

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
github open source projects do it in the

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
dot github

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
uh and you're the first project i've

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,159
actually talked about on stream uh about

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
this so i figured i'd ask that question

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,159
um but yeah this is the contributing md

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
and this is like so i had i i've been

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,480
using the cli

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,159
uh on stream uh i i actually stream uh

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,799
here on bw

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,960
if you want to actually check that out

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,360
but i do some open source contributions

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,799
uh because i use uh gh i want to

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
actually make a contribution on stream

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,679
and i think uh

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,679
uh cohost you were there i think for

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,080
this contribution you were egging me on

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,679
um but yeah it was like first time did a

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,720
go contribution to a public project that

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,240
was like

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
of this size i know it's still kind of

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
beginning uh but i found a lot of

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
context that was actually super helpful

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,960
and going back to the build um like even

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,120
understanding how to

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
run the the build command over then run

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,919
and see my changes right away

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
again this is something i've done in

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,039
javascript projects which it's usually

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
like a make file

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,400
um that that you do to build with but

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
this is actually built

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,080
directly within the language which was

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,840
pretty cool

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,159
you can use the make file too here um

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,679
but yeah it's i appreciate that

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
we listed it out just because like if

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,200
you're on windows um yeah

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,720
you're probably not going to have make

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,640
so yeah we want to make sure

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
it's it's clear how to build if you're

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,039
in an environment without make

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
yeah i understand like the challenges of

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
building

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,440
a project that needs to run in the

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
command line for multiple environments

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,159
so you have linux the different

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,520
flavors of linux mac and windows i just

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,080
recently paired program with someone on

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
windows yesterday and i was not very

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,880
helpful

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,559
at all and uh yeah

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,799
yeah go ahead oh just yeah i've been um

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:54,000
like i said i work in linux but i

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,960
i i recently got a surface book

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,840
uh laptop because i i wanted something

00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
that i could draw on

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,520
and like you know play some light games

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,880
on uh and so now

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
so i've actually been experimenting with

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,720
having windows 10 be like my laptop so i

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
work on a desktop

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,440
just about all day and then go to the

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,600
couch on that so i use wsl so i'm still

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,480
technically using linux but i've been

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,520
trying to

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
do more like tasks and just like the

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
default

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
windows experience and like it's very

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,159
different it's been like a big

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,360
learning curve for me and eye opening

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,279
like i think we could do

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
a much better job in gh of like

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,640
supporting that environment so if you're

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,400
watching and

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,039
you've been using our tool in windows uh

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,440
i i apologize for any rendering errors

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,679
we are aware of them uh and i'm trying

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
to learn more so i can fix that

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
yeah and what's the i guess what's the

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,440
process for folks who want to leverage

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,520
the

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,200
tool and provide feedback like how are

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,640
you sort of taking feedback for

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,480
from the millions of users

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,559
yeah well so um

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
the i think we mentioned like i think in

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,559
the health docs or somewhere like you

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
can just

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,600
you can open an issue with with the tool

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,240
i mean if your issue

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,159
isn't it's broken uh you can use it to

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
open an issue with a feedback label and

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,600
just kind of

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,080
give us general feedback uh or open a

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,919
bug

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
but otherwise it's going you're just

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,000
going to.com and opening an issue there

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,440
but we do everything through issues so

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,679
yeah we've talked

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,760
we've discussed like should we have like

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,000
a discussions

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,159
thing or i don't know we haven't we

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,240
haven't moved beyond issues yet

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,000
uh but yeah but as part of the 1.0

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,880
release we added the feedback

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
um tag and there's a feedback template

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
so

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,200
you can do issue create from the command

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,520
line just select feedback and then

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,039
it's just kind of a general you know

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,760
tell us what you think kind of thing

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,520
oh so you're just saying can i just do

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
gh issue create

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,679
yeah just do that and then you should

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,440
get the feedback as an option uh

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,880
well you're not you're in yeah yeah you

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,320
do dash capital r

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,159
cli cli well that might be a bug

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,320
actually i'm not sure if we pull the

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,159
templates uh for

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,840
non-vocal repositories so if you don't

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,360
feel like checked out we can see

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,880
yeah so this is this these are my

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,640
templates here

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
uh so i think it's it's actually

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
inferring that i want to do the issue

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,919
on my template um yeah you could do a

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
dash capital r

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,000
and then clf cli but i i'm not sure if

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,440
it'll pick up our templates

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,279
yeah this one's a simple title

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,039
so i'd have to be in the cli repo which

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,679
i think in most cases people aren't

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,320
don't have the cli repo local um but

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,159
interesting

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,559
if um folks want to provide that

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,600
feedback um

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,000
it might be until we talk about it yeah

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,279
now i know we should fix that yeah and

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,880
this is uh this is why we do these

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
streams as well so i actually have been

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,039
ignoring chat for a bit but uh

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
yeah um for the the stream that i did

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,919
when i contributed to

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,240
this project it was the stream where i

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,679
called you dutch uh coast he's actually

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,880
belgian so my my apologies

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,000
a big very big difference and um yeah it

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,360
sounds like people are just sort of

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
shouting out their features that they

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,640
like

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,400
um with the with the cli which is nice

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,640
nice to see

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,919
yeah so as far as the operation of the

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
project so you mentioned

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
um support is actually going through the

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,679
proper github support channels so if you

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,960
are having issues with like windows and

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
such you should definitely go there

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
uh you can go there that's you know we

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,480
have um

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
we have an official github support

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,640
person um

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
that will kind of come to us with any

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
issues that come in through official

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,480
github support

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,240
um but for you know for the most part an

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,600
issue is okay like we've been doing

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,799
support through issues

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,760
um like usage support in addition to

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
like bug

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
support

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,760
excellent sorry i'm just uh going to my

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,679
uh twitch hearts in there for

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
people saying the stream lag is gone so

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,720
it seemed like the low latency

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,360
turning that off and then also lowering

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,799
the bit rate was what did it which is

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,360
ironic because i've definitely lowered

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,919
the bit rate in the past but um

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,000
yeah it defaults at some high bit rate

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,799
um

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
anyway um yeah so talking more about the

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,799
cli

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,279
process and the project itself um

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,360
sort of how do you i guess you just

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,520
launched 1.0 so i'm not sure i'm sure

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
not sure how much engagement you've had

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,240
um as far as

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,640
feedback and interactions with the

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
community are you getting any

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
outside contributors that are consistent

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,200
and sort of

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,039
have any ability to sort of shepherd

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
that um

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
we've had really awesome outside

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,760
contributors

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,360
um and uh yeah i mean definitely uh

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
deutsche t

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,640
has done contributed a lot in the lead

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,440
up to 1.0

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,960
um avaliable's merchant is uh

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,200
cool dude has been been helping out a

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,760
lot um and it's been

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,880
active in like issues and pr's just kind

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
of

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,240
answering questions and stuff which i

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
know i really appreciate um

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,000
yeah there's a few a few other folks

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,559
that have been helping out i think

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
in a contention with this project that

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,640
has

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,880
has always been around and it's

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,480
definitely still around with 1.0 like

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,640
you know this is this is like it is a

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,600
corporate project you know like we're

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
we're we're a team at a company we're

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,159
paid

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
this is my full-time job and my my

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
teammates full-time job

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,919
to kind of design and guide this project

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,799
so we want it to be open source because

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,640
you know we want

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,919
uh people's suggestions and

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
contributions and

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,000
they've definitely like tweaked our flow

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,320
a number of times

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,760
but we do have like you know we make

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,440
plans like we have

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,279
you know we have like a road map we have

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,320
we try to keep things designed and

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,720
consistent

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,080
and so there's some tension there where

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,440
like

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,200
a lot of the feature requests that come

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,320
in like if they don't really fit into

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
that workflow

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,520
uh somebody from the art fit or the

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,720
roadmap brother somebody from their core

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,399
team has to kind of come in and be like

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,679
well this is a great idea but

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,600
here's the direction that we were kind

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,200
of going in and we'll have a

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,720
conversation about

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,320
can we capture the spirit of what you

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,919
want and like incorporate it into the

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,919
roadmap that we're doing

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,279
and that it's kind of hard to have this

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,960
conversation without the core team and

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,480
so i don't like

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,720
it's uh it's it's

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,480
can be kind of hard sometimes i think to

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
incorporate like every

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,760
future suggestion uh but something that

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,760
we want to start doing

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,840
now is just publishing a roadmap like we

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,919
would like to have a completely public

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,279
like here's what we're designing here's

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,120
what we're you know hopeful

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,559
here's what we're hoping to get to um

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
and have that be something that people

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,720
can interact with

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,960
and and understand what's coming um

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,559
and hopefully once that exists it'll be

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,840
a little bit easier for the community to

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,200
kind of help each other because right

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,399
now i feel like

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,120
a lot of things are just kind of stuck

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,720
until one of us full-time people has

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,240
can come into the issue and kind of

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,159
facilitate the conversation

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,399
yeah um and you know the roadmap's not

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,039
public yet because we're tired

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,519
we just did 1.0 and it was a lot of work

00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,279
yeah

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,559
so we're working on that like we don't

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,679
have it yeah you know we're working on

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:06,080
that right now

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,159
um after i take some time off and

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,360
we relax and do do bug fixes and stuff

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,880
for a little while but

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,799
but yeah making it a lot easier for

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,679
people to know what's coming and know

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,200
how to like fit their ideas and their

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,000
suggestion kind of into that overall

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
plan is

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,080
a big deal for us yeah there uh question

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,600
in the chat too as well

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,840
um can we leverage gh as a library or is

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,799
it only a cli tool

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,559
that's a really good question um so

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,600
right now it's just a tool

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,559
uh it would be not worth it

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,640
to try to use it as a library um you

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,720
know

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,919
what we have we haven't talked about

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,880
making it both

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
um what we have talked about is

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,480
extracting

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,000
uh some of our api and authentication

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
stuff and putting making those

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
standalone libraries

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,480
and so like we just don't have the

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,640
enough engineers to maintain

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,080
like this as a library and as a tool but

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,360
we're hoping that we can take certain

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,519
bits of it out

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
isolate those and make those libraries

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,000
and then people can use that to build

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,640
stuff using github uh so yeah like

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,960
that's

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
right now our org on github is very

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,480
empty

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
uh but we have a lot of plans for uh

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,480
filling it with

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,200
the stuff that we extract out of gh yeah

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,960
and i've

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,799
i've seen people um

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,159
go says i only do good questions people

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,039
saying that's a great question

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,080
um i only i've seen some people actually

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,120
um

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,120
embed like the the gh inside of like

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,799
actions themselves to do some cool

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
things uh i've also saw

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,480
pretty much out the gate when actions

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,760
got shipped a couple years ago uh hub

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
getting the same sort of treatment where

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,399
there are like specific hub

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,440
specific actions um so like what are you

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,640
what's your thought around

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,200
people actually injecting that in the

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,640
github actions

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,200
i think it's great um yeah like

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
you know something that you mentioned

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,919
earlier about like

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,200
it's great to have this in the command

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,760
line because it's easier to like teach

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,960
github

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,960
um yeah and

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
something that made me think of is you

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,679
know

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,039
gh is simultaneously for people that are

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
like learning the command line learning

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,480
git learning github but it's also for

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,640
people that are already super advanced

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,440
and just want to script and get going

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,720
so we try to you know take all the

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,279
things that gh

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,559
uh is supposed to do and we try to

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,080
expose it in two ways

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,000
uh we try to expose it in a sort of

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,120
human-friendly like intuitive kind of

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
interactive mode

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,240
but every one of those workflows you can

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
script by

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,600
just invoking the command a little bit

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,279
differently so like

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,640
we don't consider either of those use

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,799
cases superior like

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
we want them to be on equal footing so

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,360
using ghn actions i think is awesome

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,799
like we

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,399
that's and that's one of our goals for

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,799
us for ourselves internally because like

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
we use hub in our actions you know

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,159
because for a while

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,120
you couldn't do uh release automation

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,159
with ghsn

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,320
now but so we had a goal of like well

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,919
we want to make sure that we can use gh

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,559
in all those same scenarios

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,000
um yeah because like hub is very much

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
hub is a little bit more skewed towards

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,639
like

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,960
power users and automation and stuff

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,480
like that so we

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,320
we want to make sure that we're we're

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
not leaving those people behind if they

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,079
want to

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,159
switch and use gh yeah and i one use

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,159
case that i saw from one of my uh

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,000
uh friends in open source uh he was

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,200
leveraging gh to auth

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,839
um into a an environment uh because the

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,159
generic

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,280
github token from actions uh is

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,720
definitely very limited and i think a

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,200
lot of people when they sort of really

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,040
try to

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,599
become a power user of actions they find

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,280
very quickly the limitation

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,520
so his use case was like he just wanted

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,919
to be able to have more access without

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,919
doing the extra work of like

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,720
provisioning tokens and stuff like that

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,119
um

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,960
which i think he ended up getting it um

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,520
working without auth to be honest but

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,800
he leveraged uh gh to basically do some

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,079
of the menial work that he does to

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,560
manage his project

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,880
which was interesting to see yeah

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,480
so as far as the um uh i want to go back

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,680
to because everybody was like uh sort of

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,920
like really riled up in the the

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,720
conversation on managing open source

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
at a corporate company uh and sort of

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,000
like the direction

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,520
of that too because i think that's a

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,960
that's a common thing that i'm seeing

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,079
with a lot of projects even projects

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,160
we're having here

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,200
uh where folks are

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,240
um like open sourcing a portion of their

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,800
business so like

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,760
i don't i don't like this term open core

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
um

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,359
but like when the core of your project

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,320
itself is not

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,000
um like github github's not open source

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,400
um the actual github github

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,440
uh but a lot of pieces around github are

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
open source

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
so that kind of feels like what this is

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,480
uh

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,079
like that term that i i avoid using

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,160
again or even mentioning again

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,520
um but like what that looks like for

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,200
like the future

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,560
of the the road map and i know we sort

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,480
of touched on this a bit for like things

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,520
like rc's and like

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,040
um actually contributing this ideas to

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,000
the road map on the project

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,720
like do you think there's going to be

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,240
like a space where we have like a

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,520
sort of like a github cli

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,800
summit or meeting or contributor uh

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,119
engagement activity in the future i mean

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,240
that

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,680
that's the dream right i mean um

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,520
i would love for us to be going in that

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,040
direction i think um

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,800
so you know one thing i'll talk about

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,280
like like again we haven't we haven't

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
written our

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,880
map yet and yeah um but one of the

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,119
things that

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
uh you can actually there's a pr it's a

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,000
closed pr that you can look up

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,160
um uh something that mislove worked on

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,359
for one of our actors uh is is called

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,560
extensions

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,040
um and it's a

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,680
like a pretty lightweight way to just

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
write

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,960
any program in any language and have it

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,359
be uh

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:59,920
it kind of injected as a gh command um

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:02,480
so if you use it'll be an older one um

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,520
there it is the 1037 support for command

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,079
extensions

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,839
okay uh yeah so this is a really cool

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,240
system

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,720
um we shelved it for 1.0 just because we

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,720
were

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,359
adding support for aliases which is like

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,400
a much more lightweight version of this

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,320
but this is something that we've talked

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,880
about coming back to um and this would

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,760
allow

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,040
any contributor to extend gh in like

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
pretty complex ways

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,240
and create kind of their own gh

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,200
experiences

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,160
and this is kind of we've been talking

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,839
about this as a

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,200
as a path towards that like greater

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,400
community involvement where

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,079
people can um you know

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
they can basically propose pretty

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,599
significant changes to gh and say

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
and here it is and people can use it

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,760
today and then we on core can say like

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,359
that's awesome do you want to get it

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,240
into the main line or like

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,280
yeah stuff like that so that's that's

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,720
one route i think

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,920
um but you know in terms of like the

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,160
overall

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,320
uh overall structure of it like yeah i

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,320
mean

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,839
we are like we're this like open source

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,880
edge

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,000
on a very big graph of of you know a lot

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,920
of close sort of stuff

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,520
uh and you know there's some there is

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,320
some contention there

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,720
um and i think that

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
my hope is that the work that we're

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,880
doing

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,760
uh around like command line user

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,359
experience

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
is something that is inspiring even

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,400
beyond this tool and like

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
my hope is that some of the stuff that

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
we extract can be useful even outside of

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,359
ph and so

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,720
um i do like i still think of gh is like

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,520
a very

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,760
um gh itself feels like a pretty

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,280
mostly traditional open source project

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,040
just with the exception of the the kind

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,960
of romantic core road map

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,599
um because there's no part of gh that's

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,359
off limits to suggestions or

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,440
um you know future changes

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,960
yeah i mean i like this idea too as well

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,000
around the extensions and like whatever

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,960
it looks like when

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,160
it gets shipped or opens up as a part of

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,480
the roadmap

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,480
because i uh integrations is something

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
that it'd be nice to be able to say gas

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,079
extends

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,760
or extend uh like depend the bot like if

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,000
you wanted to actually enable that

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,119
and then get interactions with the ci

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,599
that's what one of the things i feel

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,520
like that

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,920
i think the mobile app is actually

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,000
working on uh hopefully soon

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,839
uh but like i build a lot of actions so

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,680
like i want to see my actions logs

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,240
uh but i also wanna i wanna see the logs

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,240
for things like my netlify deployments

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,400
um so like being able to have that sort

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,000
of like closer interaction to some of

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,760
the integrations that happened that

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,119
through through github would be an

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
interesting like uh direction

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:45,599
yeah i mean right now you can already do

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,119
this with um with the aliases and like

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
i've been i've been writing a little

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,359
suite

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,880
of uh of commands using aliases to do

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,640
open source uh triage um and so

00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,119
i i use the api to ask things like um

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,000
show me all the issues that either have

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,359
no comments

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,560
or no comments from like a staff member

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,160
so that i know

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,160
like what haven't we acknowledged yet

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,079
let's come in or show me everything that

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,359
has the bug label but not a priority

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,560
label like one of the three priority

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,040
labels and so

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,920
um i've been extending gh a lot with

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,400
aliases and

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,359
that's you know it's simultaneously like

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,079
super useful

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,760
but also kind of limiting because like

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,119
using the graphql

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,280
api and like a one-liner it gets like

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,200
it's like 300 characters long and so i

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,680
think like extending gh

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,960
is fun and really useful and a great way

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,880
to kind of contribute

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,400
from outside and i think the extensions

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,200
will just make that even even better and

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
even more

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
more cool and fun cool i was going to

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,680
ask the question um

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,119
are you currently working on anything

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,839
right now do you have like an open pr

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,599
that you

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,520
anything of interest that we that you

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,040
might want to share

00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,160
i know i've actually barely programmed

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,920
in like two weeks i i mean

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,319
it says we've had so many issues coming

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,520
in and we have a first responder

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,920
rotation so

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,720
somebody it's each week one of the

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,680
engineers

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,720
um and there's three of us now it was

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,119
two for a while

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,880
uh we just got a third engineer uh sam

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,880
if you see him around the repo he's very

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,319
very nice

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,280
and so yeah so one of us is on is on

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,640
call basically

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,400
uh and so i i just happened to get

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,880
this week um and so i've been doing all

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,359
issue triage um just responding to

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
people prioritizing things helping

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,119
people debug issues

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,640
um and then also trying to clean up our

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,640
issues so i've been doing like these big

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,480
audits of everything that's open

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,079
is this still valid you know just trying

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,440
to prune the

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,359
you know all the stuff that we

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,079
accumulated during the beta so

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,520
yeah i haven't done any coding and i

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,760
feel i'm getting like

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
like you know nervous like yes yesterday

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,280
i i

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,240
two days ago i think i processed over

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,240
100 bugs

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,440
in a few hours and i kept starting to

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,520
fix things like

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
i would rather be programming i think

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,920
but

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,920
yeah so not for me i think there is uh

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,960
there's some open stuff from myself that

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,119
i know i need to review

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,640
okay cool well i mean honestly i

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,599
appreciate your response to answer

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,440
because i think

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,880
self-care especially in the open source

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,839
world um

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,280
is should be more of a common thing uh

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,359
being able to take vacation

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,319
there was actually a tweet um a couple

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,200
weeks ago

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,839
of a maintainer who wanted to be able to

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,599
go on vacation so he actually

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,800
uh opened up an issue and then tweeted

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,800
out and shared it with his community

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,040
saying please don't open the issues

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,480
during this week um it ended up being

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,280
not it ended up not working

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,560
um but we just instituted a uh feature

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,960
uh yesterday

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,400
um in response to uh hacktoberfest

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,599
directly but um

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
actually not we're actually working on

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,280
this feature already but anyway the

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,880
it's be able to limit interactions so

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,359
you actually limit interactions to only

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,760
maintainers so if you happen to want to

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,920
go into a vacation mode uh that's a

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,560
pretty cool feature so everybody who

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,440
doesn't already like follow the github

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,560
change log

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,839
um you can read more about that here

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,319
so like take it out of the context of

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:18,800
hacktoberfest just generally as

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,880
um being able to um

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,079
uh limit those interactions that's this

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,960
is how you would do it so

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,960
how i recommend that

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,680
yeah this feature is awesome uh i was

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,119
really excited to see it

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,160
happen um yeah you know like i put get

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,920
out of my phone

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,000
um and i could definitely feel myself uh

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,960
responding to issues more and more when

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
i was out of the house

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,119
and at night and it just it creeped up

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,640
on me i don't know if it's like that for

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,280
other people but i didn't at any point

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,480
be like

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,599
i'm gonna work extra uh but it was just

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,880
hard you know because i knew that the

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,319
next day well there's gonna be some more

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,160
issues coming in so

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,760
you know the more issues i respond to

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,839
now maybe i'll have more time for

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
programming and so it's

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,079
eventually you burn out on that so um

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,760
you know i i

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,359
was really thankful for that i'm about

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,319
to take you know two weeks off of work

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,960
and

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,560
um i i'm definitely going to be putting

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,520
myself in that vacation mode

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,280
uh for those two weeks um so yeah i'm

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,680
i'm really thrilled that that got

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680
gotten

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,000
nice yeah i'm just looking at some of

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,200
the open pr's too as well

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,800
to be able to um

00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,480
yeah it looks like there's some like ghe

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,839
stuff so some enterprise stuff to make

00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,640
that work

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,240
um oh i even think about using gist in

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,920
the context of the cli

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,400
as well yeah that was something um

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,000
that we we wanted just support forever

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,520
but we just like couldn't justify the

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,040
prioritization

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,880
and that was something that a community

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,440
member just was like i added a just

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,599
command

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,920
uh and i was really thankful for that so

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,359
like this was during the beta we got

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,760
just create um was provided to us by

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,359
a community member and we kept talking

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,359
again like this is awesome we want even

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,000
more just uh but we just didn't really

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,680
have time

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,839
um but we managed to get done all of our

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,240
all of our wants like all of our big

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,640
desires for 1.0 and i just

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,000
i uh you know i don't want to promote

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,560
this behavior

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,599
don't do this but i spent a weekend i

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,520
went to the bar

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,040
i just balmer peaked and i wrote it much

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,880
more just so

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,359
there's some bugs with the gist commands

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,119
i'm sorry but you can now list them

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,880
and you can edit them interactively from

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,079
the command line

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,400
and so yeah it's you can do um

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,160
a bunch of things with just now the the

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,040
we don't have we don't have deletion yet

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,680
uh editing could be better um but yeah

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,640
you can do

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,440
something just and i really like it i um

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,400
i know i mean

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,599
you you saw it um the other week but we

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,280
did an internal

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,680
internal i did an internal demo for this

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,760
that i did all my all my slides were

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,040
just uh gists that i was rendering

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,119
with gh and use aliases to move between

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,880
them and yeah it's a lot of fun

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,480
yeah that's awesome and there was a was

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,839
a question uh someone came in about

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,359
making val

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,640
quality and valuable contributions and i

00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,599
think the answer you just kind of

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,000
mentioned it

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,760
uh in passing and your last response but

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
i think using the cli is probably the

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,720
best

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,440
way to make a quality contribution um

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
and i think

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,960
using the things that you could we want

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,800
to contribute to is much better than

00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,720
sort of blindly looking for bugs

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
um because you could actually you'll

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,440
probably run into those bugs you'll see

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,000
the issue there and then you have a use

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,480
case

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,119
to then sort of test your way to

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,520
actually make a contribution so

00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,480
my recommendation is use the cli uh it

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
sounds like just there's some

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,319
opportunity there

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,359
in the way just work to leverage that

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,920
maybe

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,760
make a presentation using only just and

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,359
see how that sort of works for you

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,800
and if it doesn't work for you uh come

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,800
back with feedback uh

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,720
with what how it sort of worked with you

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,000
um yeah did you have anything to add to

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,520
that nate

00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,800
i think that's a great suggestion um

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,319
and i mean yeah like i i i use gh

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,240
i try to use it as much as possible all

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,200
day and that's that's like we all do on

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,440
this game we all use it

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,280
um and yeah that's that's the best way

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,040
to figure out

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,560
where like you could in using it you

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,520
could find some little paper cut that's

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,040
really easy to fix

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,240
but because you've been using it you

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,599
know it's gonna feel really good to have

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,960
that merged and we love those kinds of

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,599
contributions um

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,480
but alternatively like uh i we've been

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,599
trying to get better

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,200
using a health wanted label um so

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,880
one of my tasks for this week i'm hoping

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,040
to get to is just kind of

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,160
we don't want any enhancement issue that

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,960
doesn't either have

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,599
a help wanted label or a core label so

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,160
we're

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,680
using core to signify like you know we

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,200
want to work on this internally

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,520
because not like privately but just like

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,800
we have a lot of this like this is maybe

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,400
involves a bunch of refactoring or

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,680
involves a lot of design decisions we'd

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,839
like to do it ourselves so that's

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,200
a core issue and then everything else

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,599
should be a help on it issue

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,200
uh and you know a lot of the

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,520
contributions that we get are like

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,520
out of the blue prs for things that

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,240
weren't labeled help wanted

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,480
maybe like had open questions about how

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,160
it should work and it's like we

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,839
it's really hard for us to accept that

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,000
kind of work you know like we

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,359
we're not really ready for it um we

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,720
weren't even really sure what direction

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,319
network should go in

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,760
so definitely like looking for that help

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,839
wanted label is a

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,280
really good first step and we're going

00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,520
to be helping out by marking way more

00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,079
stuff help on it to make that easier

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,280
um yeah and then finally just like

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,559
checking to see if anybody else is

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,960
working on it because i

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,720
you know we've had a couple instances

00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,839
where you know contributors

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,680
two or three people all want to do the

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,160
same thing and we've actually on the

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,280
same day got in prs for the exact same

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,280
oh really yeah and and um i

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,359
get like i feel i i really feel bad

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,119
whenever we have to

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,440
close the pr like i feel really guilty

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,599
like it hurts me inside uh

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,040
and uh but yeah so just definitely to

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,839
say like i want to work on this

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,880
uh and put a comment on it on the issue

00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,680
saying that

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,319
um and uh that way other community

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,119
members

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,400
can see that and and they might

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,119
collaborate with you and that maybe

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,119
that'll be fun

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,880
um but at the very least you won't be

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,680
like stepping on each other's toes

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,240
yeah so i actually same reason i've had

00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,559
some low

00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,720
like underhanded pitches for my uh my

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,559
contribution or my good first issues

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,000
where i'll get the same thing uh so i

00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,359
created this github action

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,520
to take action uh which is essentially

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
um one of the limitations for assigning

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,839
yourself to an issue is that you have to

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,079
be in the org

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,880
or you have to be an outside contributor

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,319
so

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,160
i created an action so someone just

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,400
writes the the word dot take

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,079
um onto the issue and then that way

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,520
whoever comments first like that's who i

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,319
expect to

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,640
to sort of ship the pr and if you aren't

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,839
i politely ask you to like please

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,640
you know let the other person have the

00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,280
time to to fix it um because they did go

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,200
in and say

00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,960
like i would like to fix this and like

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,160
majority that where that happens are my

00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,160
good first issues

00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,160
uh where people sort of like they i

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,520
don't know like the race error errors or

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,440
whatever race conditions

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,040
uh of everybody sort of jumping on the

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,359
same thing that's kind of really easy to

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,760
do

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,800
that i leave as like i guess at open

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,839
source maintain and relieve the

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,839
breadcrumb crumbs

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,119
in our project like yeah this would be

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,559
great to work on

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,839
uh but like i'm going to work on

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,640
something that probably is going to be a

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,119
core issue

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,559
as you mentioned um and leave this open

00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,200
up for other people to work on which it

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,800
sounds like

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,280
going back to your example of like

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,920
having the gist things work but like

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,520
i could see that not being a priority um

00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,880
just for the overall project even for

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,760
like future releases

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,680
um yeah this is really cool yeah i

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,680
we have that the exact same problem

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,000
where like i mean for i felt like such a

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,280
jerk for a while i was like

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,880
um asking people to add me as a reviewer

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,760
and everything and they're like

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,880
we can't you can't add you can't assign

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,160
you can't add your viewer unless you're

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,000
in the org and like yeah

00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,000
yeah so that's that right now it's just

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,319
manual like i i just try to check

00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,839
i go through all my notifications and if

00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,520
somebody says i want to take this i

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,559
manually assign them and so like this is

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,319
really cool tooling

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,319
yeah and it's it's this amount of bash

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,680
code um to make that work

00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,000
well this is pretty much all the work

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,079
like this could be the uh

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,359
use the gh client if i wanted to but

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,880
this is something i i talked to a

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,920
maintainer about like as

00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,240
as their issue they had um so i've had

00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,680
this

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,440
this bash code sitting around for the

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,119
longest time to make it work

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,359
uh and it's the beauty of actions is

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,800
actually to shove it into a uh

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,680
at this point now it's a well i don't

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,960
know how many people know about the

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,720
composite runs

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,559
um inside baseball i'm gonna actually

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,720
have a youtube video about this

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,319
uh in the future uh but you don't

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,240
actually have to even do a

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,359
docker container anymore you can just

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,839
shove the bash code

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,720
into the action.yaml similar to github

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,119
script

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,720
um and i'm i'm speaking of it as

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,720
everybody knows what i'm talking about

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,319
all these terms as if you follow me on

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,119
the internet but um

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,319
yeah bwo search that on youtube uh

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,520
you'll you'll see the video and i'll

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,839
explain that more in detail

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,720
uh in the future um but yeah we're

00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,640
starting i don't

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,240
i don't know anything about it yeah do

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,119
you i mean it's funny because i talked

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,520
to a lot of hovers

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,160
uh at github and like there are a lot of

00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,000
blind spots

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,200
like this like if you just use it this

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,599
way or use the

00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,480
github this way uh you might not even

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,839
use like you might

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
not even be using actions to be quite

00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,800
honest like which is um

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,920
pretty common internally because like i

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,280
don't know how much

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,000
actually not a lot of actions on github

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,359
github um mainly just ci stuff

00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,720
i yeah i learned it for a gh uh and i've

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,960
gotten pretty into it i think it's

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,040
uh it is actually really useful i i'm

00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,040
like um

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,599
uh very i i don't like

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,720
in a purely technological sense i would

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,760
describe myself as

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,440
conservative uh in that like new stuff

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,359
is like oh i don't know i have all the

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,240
things that i know uh and i like those

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,280
things and i

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,880
i really like old ideas and and

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,040
dusting them off and seeing if they're

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,800
useful like just in general i

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,160
just kind of intentionally don't look at

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,400
new things so yeah

00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,920
even as a hubber like actions i'm sure

00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,200
that somebody's excited about that i'm

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,240
not going to pay attention

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,720
uh and i didn't and then you know but

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,559
because of gh uh i needed to learn it

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,800
for doing like release automation

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,640
yeah and now i'm on board it's a good

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,640
thing uh you know i don't i don't

00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,240
reject new things i just kind of put off

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,079
learning them until i have to

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,359
uh and i don't i don't assume new things

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
are good uh because

00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,040
they're usually not there's a lesson

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,200
i've learned in my career uh you know

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,480
usually somebody is lying to you so but

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,800
action's not a lie

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,920
i think they're actually really awesome

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
there was a lot of there was definitely

00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,880
a lot of pain in actions

00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,400
up front you know we had we changed the

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,240
entire api and how it works

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,319
uh between one point and 2.0 so a lot of

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,599
people sort of got burnt out from that

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:44,000
um but i think the payoff of actually

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,880
you know even waiting for actions to

00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,839
even like be developed and have like

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,880
really cool hooks into your code base

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,680
and stuff like that

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,720
um it's wonderful and uh as you bring up

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,680
the uh

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,880
uh feeling pain and the pain point uh i

00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,640
actually wanted to show

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,319
how i i mentioned this in the video i

00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,880
created but

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,680
the way i was able to run test uh for

00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,760
the cli

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,359
was actually through code spaces which

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,000
i'm gonna have to use the uh

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,599
staff bar to get this but um everybody

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
don't pay attention to the the black bar

00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,400
at top

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,520
um yeah for whatever reason code spaces

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,079
has to

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,720
the way i have access to it it has to

00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,440
have staff bar which i'm not

00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,359
i have to clear the cache all right one

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,640
sec

00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,839
all right come on code spaces

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,520
i believe in you there we go yeah so the

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,079
way i ended up running tests because i

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,839
had a

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,160
i actually had an older version of the

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,480
cli or sort of go

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,559
locally uh and the cool thing about this

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,799
is because i'm not really

00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,319
uh it sounds like the best ring is up

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,079
again but um

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,200
i'm not a regular user of go so i had

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,400
like a version that was like three

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,480
versions old

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,319
um but i was able to just throw up a

00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,920
code space and then have that run

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,200
and then the tests were running so i

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,400
don't have to actually show this but you

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,599
all can watch the video

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,799
um and speaking of which we're actually

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,920
winding down anyway and since the

00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,319
buffering is like back

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,359
up again uh i want to thank you nate for

00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,240
chatting about the

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,440
the cli the the gh uh now everybody's

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,079
got questions about the staff bar

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,319
at this point i i i always am shy of

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,799
showing that and make sure it's off um

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,319
but anyway you could ask me more

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,000
questions and some dms

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,200
i'll give you very much no answers

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,880
because i don't know much about it

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,720
myself i just know

00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,400
i know that sometimes features can show

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,160
up in the the way people write branches

00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,799
and i don't want to

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,160
i don't want to share future things um

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,799
but yeah nate where can people find you
