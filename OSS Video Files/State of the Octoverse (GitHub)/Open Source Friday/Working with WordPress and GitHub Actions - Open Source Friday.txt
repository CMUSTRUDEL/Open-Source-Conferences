so enjoy yeah hi everybody i'm helen

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,239
good to be here do you want to briefly

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,040
talk about your background how you got

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
the programming

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
and then how you got to wordpress as

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000
well sure

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
yeah this is the part that people always

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
really like i feel like

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
um so i actually my background's in

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,760
music

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,280
um to have my undergrad and my master's

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
degrees in music

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
and i've actually like i've given talks

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
with like self-promotion i guess but

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,039
i've given talks about the skills that i

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,960
learned as a musician and how they

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,760
translated to being

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,479
a really good well hopefully a really

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
good

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
open source software developer and

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
programmer um

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
so what ended up happening i mean i feel

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,040
like it's important for

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
people to hear this stuff so when i

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
finished grad school it was like

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
uh i don't know what to do with myself

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,960
and i need like a paycheck

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,840
and health insurance you know

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,680
and so they were hiring a web developer

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
at the music conservatory that i had

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
gone to

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,720
um and so i applied

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
and uh like i've had some you know

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,680
background tinkering with

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,119
web stuff and programming um but

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,799
you know really was just like a trained

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,799
musician but they hired me

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
uh figuring you know the stuff i knew

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,479
about the school

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,200
uh gave me a serious advantage because

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,920
you can learn programming and pick it up

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
i started this project migrating us to

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
wordpress

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,759
because we had like you know budget

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
stuff this was like 2008 right so

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
everybody had like budget problems

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
it's a recession and so we were having

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
some budget stuff and you know around

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,840
software and whatever and so we were

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
like oh yeah like wordpress makes sense

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
and

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
there's this like multi-site thing where

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,760
every like department or office could

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319
have its own little

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
like piece of the site and like manage

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,959
their own stuff and we don't have to buy

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
them like adobe licenses and whatever so

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,040
i

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,680
started developing stuff on wordpress um

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,519
and then went to a word camp where i met

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
a ton of really cool wordpress people

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
and was like oh this is like an open

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,280
source thing where

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
i could contribute myself what does that

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
mean you know

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,319
um and then i don't know several months

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
later like

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,160
made my first patch for wordpress

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
because of a

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,239
missing or like a miscolored border i

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
think and uh

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
and it was merged and i was like oh

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
that's that's pretty cool

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,440
subversion is kind of weird but it's

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,080
pretty cool uh

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,599
so so yeah and then just kind of got

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
sucked into it and

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,040
started working as like a full-time

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
wordpress developer at an agency which

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
is

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
where i still am now uh it's been almost

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,920
10 years

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
and yeah it's just been a ride it sounds

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,599
like you learned a lot of this on the

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
job

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
as like part of a need yeah absolutely

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
yeah that's

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
i think that's the really cool thing

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,959
about like web development

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
um so just just for like full

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,920
transparency i did

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,760
take like computer science in high

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
school like a you know ap computer

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,360
science and that was c

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
plus based um and then i did one

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
semester

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
as a music and computer science double

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
major and

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,000
hated computer science but i did have

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,360
one semester in java

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,120
uh but i did so i do have some like very

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
basic underpinnings of like you know

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
programming logic and that kind of stuff

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
um but that's what's so cool about the

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
web i feel like is that you know you

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
start out

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
when you start out with learning stuff

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,959
like c plus plus and java everything's

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
compiled right

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,879
and so it's just this like huge rant

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
to like something that looks and feels

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
interesting

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,760
right but on the web i mean you can have

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,360
a website up and running

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,519
like immediately right and like we're

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,920
like i'm from the geocities era

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
so for me that that idea of that instant

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
gratification kind of like and

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,840
especially something like php where it

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
just like

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,919
runs there's no build there's nothing

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
it's just you edit the php and it's

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,120
there

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
yeah it's uh working with wordpress

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
still

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
in that same vein where you could just

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,400
edit php files and it sort of works

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
yeah for for a lot of use cases yeah

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,240
it's

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,080
still just yeah php so

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
excellent and uh zak katz mentioned in

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
the chat uh svn

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
still remains weird yes that might be a

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,160
good segue into

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
uh the actions that i wrote i guess yeah

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,639
i would love to

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,919
talk about that but there's also a

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,280
question about your shirt too as well if

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,160
folks are asking oh yeah

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160

honor with the extra you in it

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
but yeah that's this is my this is my

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,639
shirt so

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
well thanks for wearing it thanks for

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,560
sharing and thanks for the question in

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
the chat too as well folks

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,880
but yeah i we we got connected through

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,639
the get up action so did you want to

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,479
share and uh what you've been working on

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
also for background for the chat i live

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,680
in uh san jose costa rica

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
so sometimes my uh my lag can get a

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
little bit

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
bad just because of like physical

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
location so

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,440
github actions for wordpress so um

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,759
when when actions came out as like i

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,639
think

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,479
when it was like a closed beta phase um

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,759
like i i try to keep on top of like

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
things that are coming

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
um and like you know what are some

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
interesting things that we can do and

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
that's really like my job as

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,360
director of open source initiatives is

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
to keep an eye out for those sort of

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
like opportunities to

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,720
you know better the open source

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,319
community to push ourselves forward like

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
both as a company and the broader

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
wordpress community

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,080
right in our relationship to like what

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
is open source what does it mean

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
and so when i saw the action stuff

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,400
coming there were two things going on

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
one was that

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,759
like hopefully this is a controversial

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,199
to say but at the time i think this was

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,080
right around the time

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,759
the travis sale to like private equity

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
was announced it wasn't right before

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,199
yeah when the travis thing hit it was

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
like oh like

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
we need to think about like what if

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
something happens here right and like we

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,720
need to make moves somewhere else

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,400
and then also this is just something

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
that could solve a lot of problems right

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,720
so

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,639
so on the wordpress side i thought you

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
know the number one pain point that i

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
hear from the broader ecosystem

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
right so like i work on the core

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,759
software there's like the whole movement

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
to like contribute to wordpress and all

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
of that

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,759
but i think the the broader ecosystem of

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,599
wordpress both commercial and free

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
is really where the power of wordpress

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,280
is right and so one of the biggest

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,720
places that is is with plug-in

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
developers

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
um and a lot and when i say a lot i mean

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,240
like

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,960
50 60 000 free plug-ins in the central

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,720
wordpress.org plug-in repository

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
and these are people volunteering their

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
time right in their energy to

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
to make that happen and so one of the

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,639
things you hear a lot is

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
that it's really hard to remember how to

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
do stuff

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
in subversion um so like especially now

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,800
so like

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
10 years ago more of us were using

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
subversion

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
across different projects or whatever

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,560
but today it's like i would say it's

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
super uncommon to see subversion i would

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
say the

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
vast majority of time uh with version

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
control you're going to see git

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
these days and then you'll see still i

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,479
see some mercurial

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,160
hanging around here and there but like

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,960
you just don't see subversion in use

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
anywhere

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
um and so when you're not using it on a

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
regular basis

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,080
it's really hard to remember like what

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,400
are these commands that i have to run

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,759
what folder do i operate out of like how

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,759
does this work right

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
and so i thought you know a really cool

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,560
thing would be to take

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
um where people are now so a lot of

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,879
people are developing their stuff on

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,520
github

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,759
right running their process doing the

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,800
code all of that right there on github

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,800
so why not bridge between github

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
and the subversion repository right so

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,319
like wordpress.org

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,599
does need to remain the source of truth

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
right because we're not serving

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,479
downloads directly from

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,759
like an external source um

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,120
but we could bridge it right

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,800
and so my thought was okay i'm pretty

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
good at writing

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
you know half fake bash scripts that get

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,360
the stuff done

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,719
so why not why not do that here um and

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
so that's what i did i wrote like a

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,080
little bash script so

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,040
i have this um this is like an umbrella

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
repo um at ted up slash actions dash

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,200
wordpress

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,720
um so this is an umbrella it does have

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
these directories that have the original

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
actions on them you can see they haven't

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,880
been updated for two years

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,720
um this was before the marketplace

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
listings and the marketplace listings

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,360
require that each action live in its own

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,600
repo so we had to split them out

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
just you know for discoverability but we

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
do have this umbrella repo that lists

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,519
what we do have

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
and so i'm going to talk through there

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
are three things in here um and so the

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
one that i think is the most interesting

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
to people

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
is this deploying a plug-in to the

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,800
wordpress.org repository

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,399
um and that's here again in its own

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,279
little repo

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
and so there's a whole readme but

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,920
basically what you need to do

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
is you set a an svn username and an scn

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
password

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,399
secret in your repository because you're

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
in your repository settings these are

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,000
encrypted and i don't know

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,440
ryan you probably know more about how

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,160
exactly all this works

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
but you set these secrets um what's

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,560
really great about that is that you can

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
set

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
like you could create just a committer

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
user right like you should you don't

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,040
necessarily even need to add like your

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,519
own actual credentials

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
so like for 10 up plugins we have like a

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
10 bot

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
user that is just the committer on these

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
and that way if something happens we can

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,440
revoke it for everything right

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,519
yeah um nice and easy so instead of

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,800
going one by one

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,000
and so um you set some stuff

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,720
and you can set up a file for excluding

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
files and so this is really helpful for

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,360
if you do a build

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
right so you could like exclude source

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
files that sort of thing

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
and then there are some sample baseline

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,120
files so with actions

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
some people here probably are pretty

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
good with actions but like are

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,440
kind of skeptical about wordpress and

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,200
they're probably some people here who

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
are really into wordpress but have like

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
no idea what i'm talking about yeah with

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,959
actions

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
and so what actions does is it um you

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,000
have what's called a workflow file

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,360
that defines some things that you need

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,640
a github computer to do for you yeah

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,079
right um and so what we have here is we

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,600
have some example work

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
profiles and i'll just talk through this

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
one

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,560
so um this one what it says

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,399
is like anytime you create a release but

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,160
publish a release on github so this is

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,920
like in the github ui where you can

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
create like make a new release and it

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
creates a tag with it

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
so anytime you make a new release on

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,000
github um

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,839
it's gonna spin up an ubuntu machine so

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,440
a fancy little github computer

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,240
it's gonna check out the code this is

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,839
literally doing like a git clone

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,640
of of the uh of the tag that you've just

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
created

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
yeah in the release uh and then you can

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
run

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
build so here um this run command this

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
is just like

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
just executing commands on the command

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
line basically right so

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,279
we're doing the npm install npm run

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,920
build and then this is where my action

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,000
runs

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,200
so this is the 10 up action wordpress

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
plug and deploy

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,720
um and this is where it actually runs

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,120
and i'll talk through what it actually

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
does

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
and then we have one argument where you

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,680
can generate zip true

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
some environment variables with your

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,000
username and

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,399
password and then that

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,800
ends and that part itself does the stuff

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,760
to deploy to subversion

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,639
and then if you've generated a zip it

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
will upload it

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
to the release um right here in this

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,440
step

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
so that's what the workflow does and so

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
you commit that to a specific place in

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,639
your

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,560
plug-in repository this workflow

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,040
actually does okay

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
sorry this thing just i don't mean to

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
slow you down a bit but

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
the workflow is this uh process you're

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,440
already doing manually

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:40,560
uh in like another environment

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,560
oh man uh yes

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,120
it's uh it's replacing things that yeah

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,920
i would have had to run

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,480
locally okay um and then like copy stuff

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,600
between

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,200
folders and again remember like where

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
stuff belongs

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
okay gotcha so yeah you basically be

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,519
able to automate a portion of the

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,480
workflow that would

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,440
take more steps perhaps um but through

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,079
the sort of releases

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
event workflow on github actions uh and

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,959
then also

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,399
curious in the chat we do have quite a

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
few people here today too as well so if

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,120
you do if you know actions

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
uh let me know in the chat if you're

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
familiar with actions if you do not know

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,639
anything about actions let us know in

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
the chat

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,720
we can we can slow down speed up uh and

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,560
also same thing with wordpress

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
any wordpress developers currently

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,839
listening to this

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,079
yeah i'm totally happy to take questions

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,560
i do have it open

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,160
look over every once in a while yeah so

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
i'm not going to walk like step by step

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,639
through a bash file um

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,399
yes i will talk about the hook docs um

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,480
so this batch file

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,600
uh it's doing a lot of stuff that you

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
would have had to do

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
manually previously like locally you

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,160
would have to be like okay if i have an

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,120
assets directory where does it go um

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
because the plugin repository so each

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
plugin

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
has its own full it's actually one mono

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,279
repo

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,920
all those like 60 000 plugins is a

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,680
single subversion repository

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
and that's where is the version actually

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,440
works well for that case because

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,600
subversion allows you to check out

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
just one subfolder and assign

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,000
permissions based on subfolders so you

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,600
can kind of operate within just one area

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,079
i've heard stories yeah they're also

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
bad stories but for this case it does

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,160
work well

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,720
um and so uh you kind of have to

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,279
remember

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
in your in your actual plugin directory

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,480
itself

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,560
there is an a top level assets folder

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
then tags branches and trunk

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,800
um and so trunk represents what would be

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,399
like your primary your main branch

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,920
in git um so it can

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,839
can reflect a development state and then

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,760
the tags themselves would reflect like

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,639
actual releases that are packaged into

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,440
zips and

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
um served up for download um and then

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,880
you know

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
sometimes people named you have like an

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
assets directory

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,320
right in your actual plug-in and so you

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
kind of get into this mess of like

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
which are my actual plug-in assets which

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
are the assets that are specific

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,399
for the plug-in directory right and so

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,279
we kind of do some magic here

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,880
um to move stuff between a specifically

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,079
named folder

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,639
um there is a setting for

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,000
it uh and then we do all the subversion

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
stuff for you like we

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
got your subversion repository um

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
based on a slug uh and then it'll copy

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,040
files over

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,720
uh respecting whichever ignore file that

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,320
you decide to use

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,839
distignor is probably the one that most

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,839
people want to use at this point

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,120
so copies that stuff over copies over

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,480
those specific

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,519
plugin repository directory assets into

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
the right place

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,839
adds everything in subversion um checks

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,720
the status it copies the tag

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,480
for you from trump to the tag that's the

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
part that many people either forget to

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,880
do or i'll see like actually copy

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
the directory locally and add it but

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,120
there is subversion

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,279
copy as a command so you don't have to

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,160
like copy the files yourself

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
um it does some more subversion stuff

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
and then yeah

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,399
it commits those to subversion for you

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
uh with a little

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
it's a little message and then if you've

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,480
opted to generate a zip it'll

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
create a zip of that same plugin uh

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,519
deployment

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,199
and that's what it does and so those are

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
all the steps that you would have done

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,560
previously manually right like you would

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
have run the build locally copied

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,279
the you know necessary files over

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,560
remembering which ones you actually need

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,920
having to add them in subversion um

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,839
and then you know having to commit them

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
into the right place create the tag and

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,600
subversion right all these things that

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
like people just don't

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
remember to do because it's a lot of

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
steps yeah and you don't use subversion

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,639
all the time so

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,560
this just does it for you you create a

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,279
new release on github and it just

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,120
puts it out there for you i think it's i

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,639
use it a lot because i maintain a lot of

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,199
plug-ins through tena

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
uh and and that's how it goes so i have

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,040
an example here

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,800
um i updated this plug-in recently and

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
so yeah this is my little action

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,560
it took a minute and a half and all i

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
had to do was create a new github

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,400
release and it

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
put it out there for everybody so uh

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,880
with the build and everything so that

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,919
makes me

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,319
really happy um there's a question in

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,679
chat

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,000
i'm not sure if it's a meme or a

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,959
question but uh svn greater than uh

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,559
are better than get i will tell you

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
there are a couple things that i do like

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,160
about subversion

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,160
um i do like that subversions revision

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,360
numbers are sequential

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,280
um i understand like you know why git

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,960
uses hashes and all that stuff but

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
um when your revision numbers are

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
sequential it actually gives you like a

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,720
human insight into like how old

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
something

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
is right like was it a commit from a

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
really long time ago or was it something

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
super recent

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
i just feel like that's a little more

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,160
human and easy to understand off the bat

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
rather than like having to jump around

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,919
and like

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,039
every git management tool has to build

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
its own little like

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,640
jump to the commit before this one yeah

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
ui right

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,240
because you can't just like back up

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,720
sequentially yeah

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
um yeah yeah i still don't understand

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
the whole get magic of like when i open

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
my git log and understanding like why is

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
this commit over here and not

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
like right before it um so the way it

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
works um

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
it's something i've never looked into it

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
but also i don't really have the

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,559
bandwidth to

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,960
really get into it because i got some

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,559
other stuff i got to work on but um

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,120
but yeah sbn is something that i don't

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,440
have a lot of experience with but i do

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
i've chatted with project scara and they

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
had a very

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,840
they actually migrated to github uh

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
actually they didn't migrate to get up

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
there

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,919
they migrated to like a wordpress setup

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,679
where they do have

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,320
a um a mirror uh on github

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
and they they use mercurial so they had

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,960
to do

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,280
something similar but now with actions

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,080
but it is a similar process if you're

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
looking to leverage github uh for your

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
projects

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
uh but you might have a whole community

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
somewhere else which i wanted to ask too

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,640
as well because it might not be clear

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,840
this is a github twitch stream and a

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
channel as well

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,120
but wordpress currently not on github

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,480
no well sure i'll just talk about it

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,200
um so yeah uh wordpress um the way we

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,240
run things

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,720
is yes the the central again central

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
source of

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,919
source of truth for the wordpress core

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,960
software

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,080
is on subversion posted on

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,679
wordpress.org servers um this

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,440
subversion repository gets mirrored to a

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,520
git repository also on wordpress.org

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
that git repository is then mirrored

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,720
onto github

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,880
okay um and then on github you can

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,160
submit pull requests

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,559
you just have to attach them to um

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
a track ticket so we use track for

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,640
actual like

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,320
issue management um

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,919
lots of reasons um and there are some

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
things that i like about track

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,919
much more than github issues so this is

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,520
kind of like an internal

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,360
struggle um but yeah we you can uh

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
no you don't need to attach a zip um so

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,919
there's a field in track and also

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,679
i think we do some magic associations so

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,559
if you just

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,960
um the the full like track ticket url in

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,240
the

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,480
pr on github it'll associate it for you

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,080
and it syncs back like the pr status

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,039
like check status

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,320
and i think uh review comments um back

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,240
over to track

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
um so we're kind of syncing stuff back

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
is there is it similar to your

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,960
the way you were deploying with github

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,919
actions is there another sort of tool

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,400
that's powering the sort of syncing

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,600
uh there is a tool i don't know what it

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,679
does um i

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
i don't work on dot org infrastructure

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,480
so yeah somebody wrote something

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,760
that associates all these things um it's

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,520
pretty clever so

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,840
so we do have that going on so you can

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,159
contribute code through github

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,760
and we do use github actions in the core

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,840
software to run

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,400
tests now because we got like super

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,600
uh i don't know there's not a nice way

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
to say it we just had problems with

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,760
travis

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,280
uh so um we ran into like an emergency

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,280
sort of situation we had to like swap

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
everything over this basically two weeks

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,400
um

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
so we yeah so we're on github actions

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,679
now for testing

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
as well um and we're like sort of slowly

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
expanding

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,240
um the editor project is its own repo

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,799
and it

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,000
uh so we have this block editor so yes

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,200
most of wordpress is

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,600
like largely php based um but the editor

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,159
is

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,159
written in react um it's called

00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,159
gutenberg

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,520
yeah so gutenberg um runs as like a

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,760
parallel project right we

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,280
you know periodically sync it back um

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
but gutenberg is like it's like a mono

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,559
repo

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,440
it releases actually to many npm

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,559
packages

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,760
uh from that one large repo um

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,960
and that entire development process the

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,000
entire cycle

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,919
runs on github and they run a ton of

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,960
actions for a lot of things cleanup

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,159
deployment releasing all kinds of stuff

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,440
um and so yeah so as a project

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,120
like we very much you know

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,960
it's hard it's hard to balance because

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,200
we very much believe in

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,320
open source and the stewardship of it

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,799
and using

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,480
open source software ourselves right and

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,000
you know github is a service

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
where the service side is not open

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,280
source and so that's like a constant

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
conflict for us

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,960
but at the same time one of our values

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,880
is

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
there's the democratizing publishing

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
that we talk about like for the

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,080
the software goals but like as an open

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,799
source community that's also our goal

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,159
right to be as inclusive as possible

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,559
and sometimes that does mean that you

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
have to go where the contributors are

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,520
right you have to go where people are

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,799
comfortable where people are able to do

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,320
their best work with

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,600
fewer barriers and so right now

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,360
this is where we are okay and so we just

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,039
constantly constantly evaluating like

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
what are the best tools to like

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
accomplish it's also fair to point out

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,760
too is wordpress uh predates the

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,960
existence of github too as well

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,039
wordpress has been around

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,159
and they had systems and svn as well

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,200
existing

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,799
so to at the time and when you were

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
getting involved in 2008

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,840
to attach yourself which was when github

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,760
showed up as well

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,039
attach yourself to a new shiny thing it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
might not be the best

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,080
for the community uh so it might be best

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,880
to

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,760
figure out oh wordpress turns 18 in may

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,200
excellent

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,640
um yes hundred nodes yeah and like i

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,799
respect that too as well and like

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,480
i i don't want it to be like uh why is

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,600
wordpress not on github like that was

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
not really the mention

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
for the question but i wanted to make

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,919
sure folks were educated and that there

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,039
are other

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,880
there are other ways people are doing

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,400
open source so just know that those are

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
the ways if you want to get involved

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
um but i think there's a nice little

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,240
on-ramp if you do go to contribute with

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,279
wordpress and you join the community

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,720
you'll be um kind of

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,640
shepherded into that situation um

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,559
also gutenberg looks amazing i haven't

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
even looked at the editor

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,960
in such a long time and it's um yeah

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,960
it's a beautiful editor and i spent some

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
time working on cms's at my previous

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
employer

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,279
netlify and i mean wordpress's editor is

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,840
like the

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,520
the thing that we point we point to as

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,360
like a great experience

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,120
yeah yeah i feel like for full

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,279
disclosure uh tenoff actually

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,320
did the the redo of the github vlog i

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,440
don't i don't think we

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,799
like continue to do work on it but you

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
are on wordpress and we

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,799
need to have create github.com it's a

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,840
wordpress blog

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,320
yep all right so

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,440
i guess back to actions yeah let's get

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,000
back into action

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,440
yeah um one other thing to mention i'll

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
just mention this one briefly

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
uh is there's also a parallel action

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,080
which is a

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,600
an asset updater so sometimes um

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,039
with your wordpress plugins it might

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
continue working right especially

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,080
because we have this like

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,840
commitment to backwards compatibility in

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,360
the software um

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,679
which is you know village sword um

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,520
but sometimes you need to just update

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,039
your plugin to say it's still

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,880
compatible with the latest version of

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,400
wordpress right so you don't need to tag

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,919
a whole release you don't need anything

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
it's just like updating one

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,919
line in a review file um so there's also

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,320
a parallel action

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,840
that needs some love right now so i need

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
to get back to it

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
but the intention of it is that it goes

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,159
through your

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,840
like any time you commit something to

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
the primary branch so this is sort of

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,679
assuming more of like a git flow work

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,600
style where you have like an integration

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
develop style branch right and then you

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,440
have like your

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,120
main trunk is actually what i name it so

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,000
that it's very clear this is what sinks

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,440
back to trunk

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
on subversion um and so

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,799
anytime you make a commit to that

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
deployment

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,360
branch right the the like release branch

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,000
um it goes through it it checks and it

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
says like

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,600
you know does this have any differences

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,240
from the subversion repository

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,919
um other than readme and asset files and

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,320
if not then it will go ahead and

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,520
deploy just those readme and asset files

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,559
for you

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,919
which is also pretty slick uh so again

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,320
you you just like update

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,760
the stuff in your release branch and it

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,679
will put that out there

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
um for you so you don't again don't have

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,080
to remember subversion

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,440
you don't even have to check it out

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,200
locally like you could do all of that

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,159
just in the browser right like you just

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
edit

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,480
the readme in the browser and be done so

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,360
that's super nice

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,120
and then the thing that um i think a lot

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,000
of people don't know about

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,880
uh and i think has been picking up more

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
interest recently

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,440
is what are called hook docks um so in

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,640
wordpress we have

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,000
we're called hooks um react people

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,200
uh there are also hooks oh yeah now um

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,039
but wordpress the hook term is being

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,679
used a lot in the javascript world at

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,080
the moment is

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,600
frameworks um but is it it's a similar

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,120
construct when you think of hooks

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,880
in wordpress yes um hooks in wordpress

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,679
are very similar to the way they

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
they work in jquery i think if for

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,480
people who

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,480
maybe lived in jquery land back in the

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
day or today i don't know

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
um so they're the same thing so in

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,799
wordpress there are two types

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
um we have filters and actions and so an

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,840
action

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,600
is something that just it says hey i've

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
reached this point

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
here's a place where you can say i want

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,480
to execute some code

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
right in this moment right at this point

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,640
in this action

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,039
and then it has what are called filters

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,720
and what a filter does is it provides an

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,279
original value of something and it

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,480
allows you to alter that value so that

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,279
going forward the next part of the code

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,640
path has

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,960
this altered value for you um

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,480
so that's those are the two types of

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,320
wordpress hooks and

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,840
one of the one of the hardest things

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,799
especially when you get into like custom

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,159
development

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,559
is trying to find all those hooks

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,600
um so like how do i know what action

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,840
runs where

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,840
how do i know what parameters are passed

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,640
to this filter so that i can like

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,039
you know change my content based on you

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,679
know the post id or something right

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,320
yeah and so the wordpress core software

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,679
project

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,600
spent years documenting all of the hooks

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
and then creating a generated hook

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,720
documentation resource

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,720
and that's at actually on

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,600
developer.wordpress.org

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,000
and there's a code reference here um and

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,840
so this

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,279
is where you can see all of these uh

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,799
yeah these are hooks so

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,640
this one's a filter for instance so

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,679
block type metadata so metadata

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,799
associated with a

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,520
type of block and you can filter

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,720
alter that array of metadata based on

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
you know whatever it is that you need to

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
do

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,120
so these are the hook docs that

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:44,159
wordpress core software has

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,080
but in your custom plugins right and

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,600
especially for large plug-in projects

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
or ones that are geared toward

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,279
developers and meant to be extended

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,080
using hooks

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,720
what do we do for creating documentation

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,000
so

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
i have an action i'm going to show you

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,520
what the output looks like first

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,799
um so this is a plug-in that i

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,399
maintained through tenant called

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,080
classify it's like to

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,720
bring um you know mlai stuff services to

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,159
your

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,000
wordpress site so it can like

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,520
automatically generate alt tags for

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,880
images and that sort of thing i think i

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,640
think it's super cool

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,159
but i'm not here to like sell you on my

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
plugin um

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
you can ask questions about it uh but

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,320
what we have here is

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,760
um we generate this documentation

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,080
and it's hosted on github pages so you

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,880
can see it's 10out.github.io

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,919
classify um this is just hosting github

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,000
pages

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,080
and what we have here is all of our

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,120
actions and filters

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,279
uh right here so um let's

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,600
say we want to check out this one

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,520
classified should classify post

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,640
right so um this shows you like

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,559
what does the call look like um

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,039
gives you some plaintext description all

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,799
of this is generated from the php this

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,440
is all inline documentation that is

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
pulled out

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
and turned into these cute little static

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,320
pages

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,320
so it tells you what kind of parameters

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,279
you have the type of the parameter

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,559
what it is um so like this case we

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,960
default to

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,000
true like yes we should try to classify

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,799
this post

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,440
um but you could say like i'm gonna make

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,039
it false

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,039
if it's tagged with something in

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,559
particular right so you can go through

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,279
and kind of detect that and be like okay

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,440
actually i'm gonna

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,120
set this to false because it gives you

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,559
the post id so you can like retrieve all

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,559
the information about the post and be

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,559
like okay based on this

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,600
piece of information in the post data i

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
don't want to actually run the

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
classification

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,320
um so this is what hooked augmentation

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,520
can look like and again this is all auto

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,840
generated so what i have here is

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,600
this actually is not an action that i

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
wrote this is using

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,279
other people's actions and that's what's

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,960
so cool to me about github actions is

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,159
that like i don't necessarily have to

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,200
script anything

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,640
myself i can go and get some different

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,039
pieces and put them together into

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,519
something that does what i need it to do

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,480
so rather than providing an action what

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,799
i have here is i just

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,080
i just have a documentation page a

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,039
markdown file

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,240
explaining to you how this works um and

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,240
so what you need to do is

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,760
it does use the js doc standard that

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,200
sounds very weird we're putting js doc

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,960
standard on php doc

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,399
they're extremely similar there's only

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
really one difference

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,559
which is there are two differences one

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,000
is one of the app parameters and then

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,480
the others like it has curly braces

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,080
around the

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,960
type um but it's it's like super super

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,760
simple

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,720
um to kind of format it that way if you

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,840
want to use this

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,720
and so it explains what you need

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,080
there's js doc formatted doc blocks um

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,799
you create a build command

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,200
in your npm typically in your like your

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,279
package

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,720
json file um configuration file

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,320
the workflow file and then you need a

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
personal access token because of

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,440
deploying github pages

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,360
i don't know if this has changed yet i

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,679
know that they were talking about it

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
but right now or as a as of the last

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,559
time i checked you needed to generate a

00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,360
personal access token to actually be

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,640
able to

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,919
deploy to github pages

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,480
and so it just talks about like what do

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,919
you need to do for templating

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,000
what are some other options that are

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,760
there how to test it locally it's super

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,159
easy to test locally

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,000
and then here's some examples of what a

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,159
doc block looks like

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360
again the minor differences from the php

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
docs standard

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,559
uh what what some parts of your

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,159
package.json might look like

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,559
what the configuration might look like

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
for you

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,720
again it's very very small

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,000
and then an example workflow file and so

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
in the workflow you can see again all we

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,039
do is we check it out

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,399
we set up node to be the correct version

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,840
again i know sometimes

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,760
i don't check this stuff i don't know if

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
this is still necessary at the time it

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,840
was

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,080
um we do the install we run the build

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,760
right this is the the command we added

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,399
to our package json

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,720
and then after we run the build um it

00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,679
deploys it to github pages just like

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
that uh

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,799
and so what the build command is doing i

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,000
guess i should show but

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,960
uh yeah it just does that it

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,760
builds into a directory called hook docs

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,760
and then

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,799
that directory is then deployed to

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,399
github pages

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,159
it's like magic and it's super cool so

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,679
that makes me really happy and i've

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,640
started to see people talking about like

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,480
how do i

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,320
you know provide people with developer

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,320
documentation and i just think that

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,519
again we're we're on github as

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,200
developers right

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,000
and so to be able to kind of leverage

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,240
the same platform that we're already on

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,519
and use github pages which lots of

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,600
plugins like we're not doing anything

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,440
with github pages as it is so

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
why not put the hook documentation there

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,799
right um and so that's that's been super

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,200
fun for me is like

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,320
figuring out again what's something that

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,559
could be usable

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
for everybody solves my problems but

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,960
also

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,880
it should solve a lot of other people's

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,679
problems yeah and i think the one thing

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,360
you pointed to

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,200
as well is the fact that you had just

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,000
the markdown page of explaining how it

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
works

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,919
uh and in the workflow uh the fact that

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,440
again we are on github uh you could i

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,320
could say the steal ideas but

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,000
i guess yeah steal ideas as long as mit

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,240
or something open license you can steal

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
it

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,000
all into your heart's content um but

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,320
being able to

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,280
build on what's already there i think is

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,159
like where the

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,960
real win is there yeah absolutely i see

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,359
it as like

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,119
putting like lego together right it's

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,760
like here's a bunch of stuff that exists

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,919
for me

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
like i don't have to do like i don't

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,040
have to inject

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,320
the plastic myself right like i don't

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,240
have to do that i just

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
grab the bricks and put them together

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,320
and it does the thing that i wanted to

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,480
do

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,919
uh and so that's yeah that's what i've

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,520
really been enjoying about

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,079
messing with github actions because like

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,520
historically i'm kind of like a devops

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,200
dummy like i'm really good at breaking

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,320
stuff i'm famous for i'm really good at

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,399
breaking stuff

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
um and so for me to be able to like

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,000
actually figure this out and

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
and provide something that's helpful has

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,800
been fun for me

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,320
too yeah yeah yeah yeah well uh i did

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
also point out that dimension data has a

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,560
better let's just borrow the code

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,040
right steal it i think that's better and

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
uh

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,720
philadelphia welcome from royal town i'm

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,599
not really sure where that is but

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,800
thanks for calling it out um and the

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,640
other thing that you also mentioned too

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,000
is around

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,320
the understanding of things like

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,839
gutenberg and how it's it's using

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,079
you know react and javascript and on

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,599
github the full experience is there

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,359
and acknowledging that like there is a

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,000
movement of people doing open source

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,800
on github uh maybe people other people

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
have noticed

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,000
um but the fact that we're able to tap

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,160
into all that skill and talent

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,119
um because i also don't come from a sre

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,520
background um

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,359
i kind of just really picked it up when

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,440
i joined github because a lot of that

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,400
sort of devops stuff i had other people

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,480
in my company

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,520
in my company at my the company i worked

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,440
for uh

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,119
that was that did that much easier and

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,880
faster than i did so

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,160
i just fixed stuff that broke if i broke

00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,960
it but move away as fast as possible

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,960
yeah absolutely

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,560
cool um i'm curious though uh from your

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,599
vantage point um and do you see other

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,920
wordpress devs who are tapped into the

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,359
uh the sort of idea with github actions

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,640
and powering their

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,480
deployments of their plug-ins and stuff

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,359
like that yeah

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,599
uh definitely so i know internally at 10

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,760
up like we do have some like actual like

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,119
cd going on it's like we're using it to

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,880
deploy places

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,160
um i get you know the plug-in deployment

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,079
is also

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
sort of like that but you don't tag

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,520
plugins nearly as often as like you

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,320
deploy a website right

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,680
um so so i do see people doing that i

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
know that they're

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
some other people who do a lot of work

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,480
on the core software as well

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,480
and are like me and also work at

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,839
agencies right so like

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,079
there are a number of us who are like

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,680
sponsored through agencies or

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,000
plug-in development shops and we're

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,240
sponsored to work on wordpress

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,280
which is a big part of that ecosystem as

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
well

00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,920
so i do know that there are a lot of

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,280
people who work on things like linting

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,119
actions

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,560
we have our like a specific phpcs so

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,520
like coding standards

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,480
specific to wordpress styles and so

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,240
integrating that

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,400
and taking advantage of annotations

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,839
which i think are really freaking cool

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,880
um in in the way that uh those can run

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,920
on github so if

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,240
people haven't seen this i should have

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,599
pulled up an example but if you haven't

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,520
seen this like if you

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,720
if um somebody sets up minting

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,200
correctly in

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,720
using github actions um there are other

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
services that'll do it but honestly look

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,240
it's just

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,920
easier to just run in on github um it

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,119
supports annotations and so what it does

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
is instead of just like spitting out a

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,079
report of like

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,680
here are the lines and like the problems

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
that were on those lines it actually

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,680
injects this directly into the pr view

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,760
so like when you're in the code view and

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,800
a pr under line

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,440
you know 13 in your pr it'll be like

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
here was a php coding standard error

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,200
you're missing

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,839
a space or something right um and it

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,960
does this like

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,040
inline in the code review view um

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,119
in a pr and so like if you're the

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,920
contributor or the maintainer you can go

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,200
through and like

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,280
apply those changes um like again in the

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,520
web ui which is um

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,560
a thing that i'm really on about is

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,440
that's a big part

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,359
to me of like how do you include as many

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,440
contributors as possible right

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,480
is understanding that your contributor

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,520
base

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,200
may only have one device right

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,960
so like and especially like newer

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,599
generations like they may only have a

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,359
phone

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,800
right they may not even have like their

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,400
own computer or they're

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,240
on like a chromebook or something where

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,560
you don't actually have

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,440
like system access right all you have is

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,440
a browser

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,440
right it's very common or maybe it's

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,200
somebody who's only accesses through

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,680
like their local library or something

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
right

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,720
these are all people who are perfectly

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,960
valuable

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,000
have just as much to say and so this

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,000
idea of

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,680
like being able to bring more of this

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,480
process into

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,560
the web browser is super powerful right

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,800
the ability to like do a code review

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,839
to apply small changes or make big

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,520
changes

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,440
um and then one of the other things like

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,119
that github is working on i need to

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,920
figure this out for wordpress

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,960
um the code spaces stuff is super cool

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,280
to me yeah

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,240
because to me it's it's this idea of

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
like

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,800
what i haven't figured out is how to

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,320
make it actually run a wordpress site

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
because wordpress stores

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,079
the site url in the database so i

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,480
haven't figured out that part yet

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,000
um with the with the port forwarding um

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,440
but like imagine

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,440
sorry i'm not trying to be a your

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,680
solutions engineer uh the

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,400
database that wordpress uses is it sql

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,839
based or a certain flavor yes yeah okay

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,920
yeah i wonder if you could use one of

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,160
the um one of the cloud

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,520
so if it would it be sqlite could you

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,320
use that

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,720
i don't i don't know okay probably not

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,079
yeah

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
because i've been playing around with a

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,320
lot of cool of these hosted uh

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,599
sql or postgres database solutions right

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
this is like outside of my work at

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,079
github but like i've been flying around

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,520
like

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,280
some of the postgres solutions like

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,680
planet scale and super bass

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,040
um that you can just pipe it to a url

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,839
that's already hosted

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,200
um it could be a solution uh it just

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,720
depends

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,359
yeah i think the the problem i was

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,200
running into is that because we store

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,040
what we what we do is we store the site

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,040
url in the database

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,640
and so with port forwarding and code

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,359
spaces it's like dynamically

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,359
generating a url and so there's i have

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,000
not figured out how you can get that url

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,680
and then

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
shove it into the database or write it

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,240
into a config file as an override

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,359
so that you can actually access the

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,040
wordpress site through the port

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,720
forwarding yeah um

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,240
i i should introduce you to someone on

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,599
the team and they can they can help you

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,800
out with that

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,079
make it work for me yeah

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,359
that's what this is that's what this is

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
all about right it's like finding the

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,240
right people

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,680
but yeah like i just imagine that you

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,839
know you're working on

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,839
something as complex as the editor right

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,599
which is this huge react app and you

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,560
want to test a change

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,000
but you're like on the go or like i'm a

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,599
parent right so like i might be like

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,480
sitting in my kitchen on my ipad or

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,240
something

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,839
and so the idea that like i could spin

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,079
up a remote environment

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,079
that does the build from that pull

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,520
request from that branch whatever

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,280
and be able to test it like wherever i

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,960
am on whatever device i have or if i

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,480
need to do mobile testing

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,400
right and not have to worry about like

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,000
building it locally

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,720
trying to set up a web server inside my

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,160
house or you know whatever

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
so if i want to do this sort of mobile

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,760
testing to be able to do it all through

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,760
you know one place again um is super

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
powerful to me and so that's like

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,480
i think to me that's probably like my

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,119
next big thing that i need to

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,240
dive into on the like how does wordpress

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,000
use github front

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,359
yeah yeah but this was a fun

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,960
conversation i really enjoyed

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,599
learning about wordpress learn about

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,480

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,079
keep the system or the lights on i guess

00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
uh but yeah it's nice to hear

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,440
to look over the shoulders of other

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,359

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,359
