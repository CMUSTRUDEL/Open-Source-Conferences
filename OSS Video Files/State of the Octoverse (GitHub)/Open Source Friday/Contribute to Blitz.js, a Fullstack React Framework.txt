Title: Contribute to Blitz.js, a Fullstack React Framework
Publication date: 2020-10-20
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	“Zero-API” data layer lets you import server code directly into your React components instead of having to manually add API endpoints and do client-side fetching and caching.

Includes everything you need for production apps. Everything end-to-end from the database to the frontend.

Blitz brings back the simplicity and conventions of server-rendered frameworks like Ruby on Rails while preserving everything we love about React and client-side rendering!

essentially just learn about uh how to

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,039
contribute projects how projects are

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
built

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
uh on github and um here today brandon

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
you're a maintainer of

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,440
blitzjs so do you want to give an

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
introduction of like

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,680
who you are and how you got into sort of

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,879
making blitch.js

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,600
sure so um i've

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
i'm i've been a full stack web developer

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,840
for

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
um i don't know five years now and then

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
before that i was doing

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
i was doing c and c plus plus i have an

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,560
engine

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,400
a college degree in the electrical

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
engineering but i kind of left that

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
behind and

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,680
i like software just a lot better so

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
anyways i learned ruby on rails

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,119
like five years ago or something and so

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
that was that was really influential on

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,079
how i

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,840
learned web development and doing full

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
stack apps and so forth

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
and mostly what i've done is building

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
sas app you know type products for

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
smaller companies and startups

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
and then three years ago i started doing

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,360
consulting so i've been consulting as an

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
independent freelancer

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
for three years and again building a lot

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,560
of apps

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,960
and i really liked the ruby on rails

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
you know like how it how it worked um

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
the productivity of it you know

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,200
everything's there

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,040
you kind of it's just it's pretty

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,840
straightforward um

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,360
but yet i i really hated the templates

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
like i really want to react for the

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,080
dynamic uis and stuff

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,920
yeah and so

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
like we didn't really have the rails

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
experience for react

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
and i just kept wanting that more and

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
more but didn't really know what it

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,480
looked like

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
like does it have got ql in there or

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,879
like

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
because you have this api layer and

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,319
that's like the biggest kind of uh

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,680
like not in the whole thing because

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
rails doesn't have that and if you have

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
an api

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,840
then you can't really have the rails

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
experience

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
so that kind of brought me up to

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
february of this year

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
where i realized that you know what i

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,400
think we can make this happen somehow

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,319
with next js because of all the awesome

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,040
features that they've been putting out

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
and then also prisma 2 has a really

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
awesome database client which we hadn't

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,599
really had yet

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,800
and so that's that's how it started yeah

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,560
that's um

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
that's awesome too and like we were

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
chatting before we actually went live

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,040
here and i didn't even realize

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,519
that blitzjs has only been around since

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
february of this year uh which honestly

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
that's been a pretty wild year for you

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
then

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,239
um because i mean that and also other

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,239
things of obvious nature but uh

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
yeah and i also came up learning uh ruby

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
on rails as well we actually learned the

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,080
same way

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,519
uh which also i discovered when i first

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
met you yeah

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,159
um from sorry i learned from a boot camp

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
the same boot camp that uh that brandon

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,560
attended as well

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,239
um which is like a testament of like

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
you don't have to have 20 plus years of

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,159
experience in programming

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,519
um you can just have a nice interest and

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
learn how to get stuff done

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
and then share your knowledge with with

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
folks through open source which is uh

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,680
like really the value of like

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,400
conversations like this

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,959
yeah to be clear yeah just to clarify

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
like you don't have a cs degree

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
no i have electrical engineering degree

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,599
which they teach you

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,680
two classes on software uh or

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,080
three i guess one on one on java and two

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,879
on c

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
so excellent yeah and um yeah so

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
listeners uh who are

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680

let us know if you are interested in

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
ruby on rails uh the blitz framework if

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,199
you do react

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,840
um definitely let us know what got you

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,440

with us this morning uh also

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
i see a bunch of people hitting the

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
follow button if you follow the channel

you'll get updated with

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
every week we'll have open source friday

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,400
chats for the next six weeks

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
uh so i'll mention a couple of those

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,440
later on that we have in the future

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,360
uh hello from costa rica tandoor hello

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,960
and uh we got uh some react lovers too

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
as well and graphql f

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280
graphql fm they're coming in here

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,320
they're they're stalking us

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,160
they're gonna make uh make some uh

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,160
some clips for their uh their future

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,280
podcasts all right so

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,520
um so brandon i'm curious of like why

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,720
why i guess why now like did you have a

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,080
goal of

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
solving a problem were you building a

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,320
product or did you just sort of like

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,320
have some free time um

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,039
i i just like the pressure build up

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
enough i guess where it's like

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,240
okay like this is this is it and then

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
like i mentioned

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,360
with prisma it was like i think it was

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,600
in beta

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
it just released in beta maybe or maybe

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
it's still alpha when i

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
when i first started but i knew that

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,759
like yeah this is going to be awesome

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,400
um and then peridot's next js and so

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
like originally i thought it would be

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,919
like the goal was to eliminate the the

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
api layer so you don't have to do data

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
fetching and

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
build the api and all of that and so i

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
thought it was going to be server-side

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,400
rendered using

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,759
i guess server-side props in xjs and

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
that's what my initial prototype and

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,600
announcement was

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
but then after we were just exploring

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,880
like i got a bunch of

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,400
i think there was i had over it was over

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,080
45 people

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,000
um that responded to my launch tweet

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
that were interested in helping because

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
i was like yeah this you know

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
there's not much here we need to build

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
it i need help and so there's over 45

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,520
people who responded

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,639
and then i think about roughly 10 that

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
that actively like got in and helped and

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
many of those are still

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,880
still active contributors today um so

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,479
they so

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,039
as we were kind of working through like

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,600
what is the architecture going to be

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,639
um we're exploring all kinds of

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
different stuff like if we're going to

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
use model view controller

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
like rails and laravel and that sort of

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
pattern

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,639
are we going to use something totally

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
different are we going to use graphql

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,560
like that was on the table at one point

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,960
um and one day i was just

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
laying in a hammock in thailand thinking

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,039
about

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,199
like how how can we make this easy

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,039
and and so i i literally i might ask

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
myself what would this look like if it

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
was easy

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,240
like for to install i was like okay so i

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,199
want to write some server code

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,479
uh code that runs on the server and then

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,479
if it was easy i could just

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
import that directly into my react

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,479
components

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,280
and just like use it like a function and

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,000
i was like oh

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,440
that's actually pretty cool let's maybe

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
we can make that work

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,039
and so that's that's literally uh what

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,560
we have today

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,039
is we abstract the

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
api layer into a compile step and so in

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,759
development you write your server

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
functions you import them into your

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,280
components

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,599
and use them there and then at compile

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
time we swap that import out with a an

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,000
api

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,000
call and so you do get client-side

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
rendering um

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
but you can also do server-side

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
rendering if you use the git service

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
like props

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,840
um you can do static generation like

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,039
gatsby with get static props

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,400
and so blitz is awesome because of next

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
and it's fully hybrid you can do

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
you know you can have a marketing site

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
that's all static

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,680
in the same app and same code base as a

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,599
monolith and you can have your app

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
uh section that's fully dynamic

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,759
client-side rendered

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,199
and so it's super flexible yeah that's

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,879
awesome so like if you don't mind i

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,280
think i'm going to transition us to

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
looking at the uh the site itself is

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
getting people sort of like the the idea

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,160
of what

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
we're talking about too as well so like

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
if that wasn't clear

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
you're you've built on top of next.js so

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,960
nextgs actually was on the stream

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,240
uh back in i think early june late april

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,440
uh you can check out the youtube channel

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,120
github's youtube channel if you want to

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
actually see that conversation

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
um but they've done a lot of really cool

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,120
things uh this year and like making it

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,440
easier to sort of like attach things to

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
nexus but you've got that you've got

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
prisma

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
which is handling the data layer and

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
then you

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,279
if i understand this correctly uh do you

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
have like a documentation that can

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,360
actually see this

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,360
um like a quick start somewhere

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,760
um right there you have a quick start on

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
this page you were just on

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
what part do you want to see uh so when

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
you you're passing in the data from from

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
prisma because you're saying that you

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,240
could uh

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,600
pass it as a function um

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,480
let's go to the tutorial yeah it's the

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
on the left side yeah i think this will

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,200
show what you

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,279
what you're looking for okay so yeah

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
this is the the file structure

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,720
uh so somewhere to the next it has a

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,080
very so you have like

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
very clear uh opinions on file structure

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
and things like that

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
um so a lot of this a lot of the files

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
default file structure is not enforced

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
okay you can totally rearrange it yeah

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
um

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
so we do have the same type of pages

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
folder like next js

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,800
uh but unlike next.js you can have mini

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
pages folders so you can

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,240
have multiple pages and organize

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
your code versus having all your pages

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,839
in one single pages

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
you can have like a pages in each uh

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,080
folder for different features

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,080
okay oh yes similar yeah excellent and

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,600
i'm curious so since february

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,360
um you all have gone from zero to 4.3

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,560
000 stars so like

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,560
people are paying attention at this

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
point right it seems like

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,680
uh how has it been like as far as

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,399
adoption so i also see

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,000
103 issues uh which seems like there are

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,839
there are people requesting things and

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
finding finding things as well

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
the insights tab is uh interesting to

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
look at too

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,279
and you can switch to the month viewer

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,800
and see like it's pretty act so that's

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,760
one week we've had 31

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
merch full requests

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,200
that is uh it's not too bad 35 authors

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,760
so yeah so like what was the sort of

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,760
like

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,760
ramp up or was there a promotion period

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
outside of that tweet and also we didn't

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
even we didn't bring up your

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,600
your twitter um i've got your twitter

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,279
here that i can drop it there but uh

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,440
like you tweeted out i'm doing a thing

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,800
it showed up on hacker news and then now

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
we hear now we're actually

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
i don't think it it still hasn't uh

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
gotten traction on hacker news oh it

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
doesn't

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,560
okay it's just literally just tweeting

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,440
the the other hacker news for

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,399
developers okay excellent that's that's

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,839
pretty amazing

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,079
um yeah so it's

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
i mean there it's just been slow steady

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,640
growth basically

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,920
um nothing has just been me like

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,360
doing marketing as as best as i can

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,720
um also all these uh

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,320
all these commits too yeah um

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
one thing that definitely helped i think

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
early on was i got invited to speak at

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,519
react europe conference that was in

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,800
april or may i think yeah and so they

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,440
it was just soon after i had announced

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,560
uh was that i think the alpha had just

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
released

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,839
um and they messaged me and they're like

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
hey the conference is in three weeks we

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,880
have an opening you want to talk and i

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,720
was like yeah

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,880
so wow nice i mean that's

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,120
that's great timing on your part too as

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
well and i think that's like also

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
what's hard about like getting adoption

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,480
in like projects and doing open source

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,600
even like if you have a side project and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,839
you want other people to help and

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
contribute like i know

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,800
starting next week or at the end next

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
week we're gonna have hacktoberfest as a

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
thing

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
and like folks always are looking for

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
contributors to join their projects and

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
help out

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,600
and sort of provide feedback because

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,600
it's hard doing it alone

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
uh so having a community and

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
collaborators

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,320
uh as part of that community is like

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,079
it's it's really valuable

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,000
and it helps you sort of like actually

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,560
push through and

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
like actually you know it gives you

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,440
something to wake up like i think if you

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
have a startup you're able to

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
have the customer engagement and like

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
this sort of like gets you excited

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
um but when it comes to things like open

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,959
source projects like

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,800
i think the uh the contributor

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,360
experience is nice to nice to see as

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
well just

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
speaking as a maintainer of a small

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,600
project myself

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,680
yeah and one thing that definitely

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,519
helped was

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,360
when i like i only had it was only a

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,160
couple hundred a couple hundred lines of

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,560
code

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
uh that i had just prototype code when i

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
had non splits

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
yeah but i was like very clear that like

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,200
uh like there's

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,800
basically everything needs built and i

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,000
need your help to build it

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,360
and so um i basically kind of built the

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
community before the product

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,959
so to speak and that definitely helped

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,360
with everybody

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
that joined early on like feeling

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,440
ownership over

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,760
it and helping versus me

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
slaving away for something for a year

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,720
and then announcing it be like hey

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
here's this thing like please come help

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
me

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,920
and so instead it's like we're all

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,160
building this thing together

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
yeah and speaking about together i want

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
to actually

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
chat about how you sort of manage your

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
contributors

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
uh because when i scroll down to the

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,480
readme excuse me

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,560
when i scroll down to read me i see this

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
nice uh

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,560
list of maintainer level two and chord

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,320
team like what's uh what's that about

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,480
um so after we

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
made the first alpha release like

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
activity on github exploded

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,639
so tons of issues on the pr's and i was

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,680
like oh no i need help

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,000
so so i quickly uh set up these

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,160
uh level one and level two maintainers

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,399
and we have a dedicated docs page

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,920
now on the on the documentation site

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,120
that's you can click there it'll

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
redirect

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,240
redirect uh click to here well

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:25,360
go back to this yeah there we go

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,839
i need to update that link um but

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,079
i guess uh issues are welcomed or

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,160
contributions

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,760
yeah um so the the idea here is that you

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
have level one maintainer it's kind of

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
like

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,920
uh tier one support where they're just

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,399
doing like issue triage

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,639
um helping just being interactive in the

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,079
community helping answer questions

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,720
um you know somebody has a problem or

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,240
a bug report like making sure that they

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,240
have a way to reproduce it

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
have they tried on the latest version

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
that sort of stuff

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,360
so that's level one maintainers and then

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,279
level two maintainers is

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
people who have actual code ownership

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
over over

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
some some amount of code and then they

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,480
can like

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,440
be responsible for reviewing and merging

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
prs

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
that are related to that that section

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,760
and then so

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,839
core team is is supposed to be freed up

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,360
more to work on higher level features

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
ideas like uh versus the day-to-day

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
stuff

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,440
but turns out i'm still doing a lot of

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,000
the day-to-day

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,160
prs and stuff but it's they're people

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,120
are starting to help out more and it's

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,560
going good okay and you do you sort of

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
engage the community through it looks

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
like through slack so do you have like a

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
stand-up

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
or a sort of asynchronous like

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,720
discussion or something like that

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,519
sure so um we we for a while for the

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
first

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,120
like four or five months or something

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,519
like that we had a

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,040
weekly contributor call just a zoom call

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,160
where anyone contributing would

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,360
join um because where it was just we're

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,519
iterating rapidly

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,120
making lots of progress and so we had

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
that for a while but then it kind of

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
dropped off because progress slowed down

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,279
we're working on

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,639
bigger longer term features um and so we

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,360
haven't done that for a while

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,360
but probably we'll i want to start a

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
weekly or bi-weekly meet-up where just

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,399
anyone can join

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
not necessarily contributors it's kind

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
of more just regular community focused

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,839
but

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,199
yeah and like i think and now nowadays

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,720
like i think there's like a lot of

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,440
opportunity for things like the by lazy

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
meetup

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
uh i don't know if you if you've chatted

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
with the red wood js folks but they have

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,880
something similar

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
where it's not specifically contributor

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
focus but it is like a monthly

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,000
like everybody around the world who

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,920
wants to hear more about that

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,199
they're able to sort of sit in and learn

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,199
and sort of

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,959
learn directly from the source which is

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,519
the the i guess maintainer

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,800
the level was it core maintainer what

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
was the other level

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
14 yeah yeah core team yeah which is

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,199
like invaluable

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,800
because you you have all the knowledge

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,759
in your head you've basically been there

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,639
since alpha or

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,399
commit zero um so like to be able to ask

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,839
you questions on like why

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,160
decisions were made or if there's

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
possibility like using prisma now

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,679
but is there a possibility to sort of

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,559
hot swap through like future plug-ins or

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
growth which

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,360
i'm curious um you like the the

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
structure of the monolith today for

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,640
blitz js

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,319
like is there opportunity to have

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,959
different uses because i know if rails

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,199
you can

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,559
you could sort of get working you

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
can get working on rails

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,600
uh even though it's like it's a post

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,000
rescue thing

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,280
oh yeah good question so blitz is fully

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,919
database agnostic

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,799
okay it comes with prisma by default but

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,840
you can totally

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,440
uh swap it out um and just use any

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
database client like there's

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
like rails it's more tricky with rails

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,960
because of the whole active record

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,240
thing in making work with other

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
databases yeah

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,559
but we don't have that in blitz and so

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,919
it's you can just directly use any type

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
of database client you can use

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,000
fauna we're going to get a final example

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,559
of soon um you can use

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,360
you know anything like that yeah so with

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,840
the um

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:07,679
like the agnostic like i know that um

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,120
i know that prisma is is it diagnostic

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,240
like as far as the database layer can

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,919
prince might use something besides

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,919
postgresql

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,960
yeah right now it's uh mysql and sqlite

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,679
but they're they're going to be adding

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,320
support for um probably fauna

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,720
dynamodb and their their goal is to be

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,799
like a universal database client to work

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,799
with as many databases as possible

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,520
okay excellent yeah so

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,000
uh are there examples that you want to

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
show us

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,559
and and walk us through or

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,480
uh just general uh which to ask we sort

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,880
of scrape the surface of the tutorial

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,520
of how to get started um

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,039
there's nothing really like on the docks

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
versus like just going to the terminal

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
and

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,960
and setting it up but it's it's so easy

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
that

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
like if you're watching like just just

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
go run uh

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
you can install blitz globally or use

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
npx blitz

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
new you can see you can use mpx blitz

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,080
new my app

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,840
or whatever name you want and it'll

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
scaffold out the um

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
whatever you it'll scaffold out your app

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
so it it sets

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,360
up uh i just did that in the wrong

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,480
folder

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,880
it sets up user login

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
uh signup and log in and log out by

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,679
default and new apps so as soon as this

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,360
finishes

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,080
um you can create an account and log in

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,280
log out etc and your like authentication

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,039
is done for you

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,640
so that's that's something that's super

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,240
amazing we're gonna be adding uh forgot

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,039
password flows soon

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,039
and email confirmation okay um

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,480
so yeah this will take a bit probably

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,760
because

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
yeah installing everything yeah we'll

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,240
let this run and i'll play with this

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,919
live too as well

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,600
uh just for the sake of the chat fire

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
lemons we don't have any chat commands

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
uh thanks for for checking for us uh

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,400
we're happy to take uh

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,919
uh suggestions in the future uh you can

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,559
find us on the meetup page and you can

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,520
find my

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,240
my my email or you can whisper me if

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
you'd like

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
um but yeah thanks for trying uh and

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,640
also marco welcome

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,679
welcome in all right so we're gonna let

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,960
that run for a bit

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,360
um yeah so i'm curious uh i mean we are

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,400
what uh a week away from hacktoberfest

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,600
like what sort of things are you getting

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,799
ready to prepare for

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,880
for a hackerfest um so we

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,320
we have most of this stuff just there by

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
default with um

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,360
so the best place to get started

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
contributing is on the documentation

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,039
site

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,799
yeah we have a how to contribute on the

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
left side under community

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,159
oh perfect i like seeing stuff like that

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
so

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
so this this walks you through the very

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,760
first thing we say if you're new to open

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,360
source

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,360
go look at kinsey dodds how to

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
contribute to open source project

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
um so that's really helpful for like

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,240
what is a fork how do you fork

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
uh what's a pr um all of that sort of

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
stuff

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,280
and then we have the code of conduct and

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,039
then also we have a page on how the

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,799
community operates so that's

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
if you want to be involved in the bliss

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,760
community that's a really good page that

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,200
we just added this week

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,559
that just details like everything like

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,080
who's involved um it talks about the the

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,760
maintainers talks about

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,960
how to file bug reports how to submit um

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,720
like how to be involved how to how to

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
like gain stature and status in the

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
community

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,559
all of that sort of stuff goes through

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,320
there there is a question in the chat uh

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
from shinespin

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
shine some sorry matt definitely

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
butchered that name but uh

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
are there pre requisites for learning

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,640
bush js

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,640
no so what you need to know react

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
uh but you can learn react at the same

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,440
time you're learning blitz

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,240
yeah yeah um and yeah so you don't have

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,039
to know about

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
an xjs we have all the documentation

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,440
that you need

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,000
um so now excellent

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,120
yeah um yeah that's pretty awesome and i

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,559
think it's the same thing with like so

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
we already mentioned ruby on rails and

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,799
like that's

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,559
your inspiration for building the

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,840
structure of this like

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,240
same thing ruby on rails you don't

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,600
actually have to do strict ruby

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,360
uh to get by um or even any other

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,600
framework because

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,520
the framework i guess it has enough

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,559
opinions to sort of push you along

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,799
and learn as you go um and i think uh

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
next jso has a really strong community

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,400
and i'm not sure how much

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,280
how much of the next gs is exposed in

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,120
the blitz app

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,200
uh i assume a lot of it is probably

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
pretty pretty familiar there's actually

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,039
all of it

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,360
yeah it's yes are you gonna be

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,480
attending uh next jazz conf in what a

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,200
couple weeks

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,799
yeah uh hopefully i'll get to speak i've

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,000
applied we'll see

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,600
excellent they're listening what's good

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,280
with them a little nudge

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,840
cool i'm just going to take a little a

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,000
little check on our uh

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,200
okay so i have to choose a form library

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,799
it looks like

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,080
yep you have any suggestions oh i guess

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,440
to recommend it i'll just do a react

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
final form which i've

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
actually never never actually used

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,559
before so exciting

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,559
uh but we'll just look at the hello

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,400
world i won't actually i won't

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,799
bore the listeners and watch them

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
struggle write code uh live on the air

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,400
so this will take a few more minutes to

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,080
install the packages for the app so

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,799
it was previously it was installing the

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,799
blitz cli gotcha

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,480
yeah very cool well i mean hopefully

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,280
with npm seven that will that will be a

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,200
little faster

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,200
yeah um so here on this how to

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
contribute page scroll up to um what to

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,440
work on

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,320
yeah what i saw that right here

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,159
yeah so the click on that and so we have

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,480
these

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,480
um

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
what the uh what your docks are made

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,840
with it's uh pretty nice um it's

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,840
currently docusaurus

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,520
but i think we might actually switch to

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,080
using blitz for the docks

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
okay well yeah uh dog footing makes a

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,039
lot of sense

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,240
so i clicked through that link and there

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,039
is a label for

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,520
status ready to work on which is yeah so

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,760
yeah

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,200
all of these issues are ready for anyone

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,760
can come in and just say

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
comment on the comment on it and say i'm

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,640
going to work on this

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,039
and there you go and we'll assign it to

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,480
you too and then it'll change the status

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,640
to um

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,919
status slash assign we have we have a

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,080
bot set up that

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,520
syncs the like if you're assigned it

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,039
will automatically set the label and

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,880
then also syncs the labels with the

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,600
project board

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,720
so it's really easy for us to manage

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,440
yeah well how is that

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,080
is that bot something you are managing

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
or is it

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,000
yeah yeah yeah it's a custom bot

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,640
somebody actually a couple people worked

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,120
on it

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,720
um thankfully yeah excellent uh i'm here

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
now i'm intrigued too because i i built

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,039
a few bots myself uh

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
is it built with the what's like probot

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,679
or is it uh

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,159
okay excellent yes big fan um so then

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,679
and then inside uh these issues that are

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,000
ready to work on there's also issues

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,559
that are marked a good first issue

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,400
and the good first issue ones they're

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,000
like

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,760
quite easy very simple um and so it like

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,039
really is a good first issue if you're

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,840
you don't have to really know anything

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,960
about blitz um most of the time we try

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,600
to link like to

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,360
exactly the file or the line of source

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,120
code that needs changed

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,799
so it's so it's easy to be like okay

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
come in and modify this line and there

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
you go

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,440
and then we also have good second issue

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
tags that are like

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,400
if you if you're a bit more experienced

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,200
with knowing what's going on in rails

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
or in blitz then those are good for you

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,520
too

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,360
i've never actually seen good second

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,960
issue before in a project but it's

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,200
also a genius it's it looks like there's

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
a lot of care of uh actually maintaining

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
the project because uh even with the

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,559
project that's only been around since

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,799
february

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,200
uh it seems like you've put a lot of

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,760
intent into making sure there's like

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,640
a sort of onboarding path for for folks

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
um

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
and speaking of which uh there's a

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,080
question in the chat um

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,320
can you confirm the responsiveness of

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
the blitz team so i assume like if you

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,080
say i would like to work on this like is

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,159
there i don't i don't assume you have

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
slash but i'm curious how how soon can

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
someone

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,400
uh expect to get uh i guess a response

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,400
it depends how much money you send me

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,720
though i also have that in the uh doc so

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,679
it says what to expect after submitting

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,279
a pr

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,279
and we will usually respond within

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,720
a couple days usually review your pr

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,240
within a couple days

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,960
um so it depends like if we're on

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,640
vacation the weekend what's going on

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
but we try to make it fairly quick

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,039
within a day or two same thing with

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
if you submit an issue we usually try to

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,880
reply within a day or two

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,400
yeah to follow up somewhere else yeah

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,159
and i think it's uh

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
to be fair for open source maintainers

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,000
it's uh your i assume you're not you're

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,760
not getting paid this is not vc backed

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,799
or anything like that so this is like

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,880
this is your time so uh like if since

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,840
you have some long-standing features

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
i think it's uh it's okay to wait a

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,279
couple days or

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,320
if someone really is excited looks like

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,159
you can go into slack

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600
as well yeah yeah so if you if you have

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,799
something as like you need

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,240
something fast um you can you can post

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,919
on slack and

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
people usually respond quicker in there

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,320
yeah

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,360
excellent and then um as far as uh and

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,720
then going back to the

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,399
the tier one maintainers um and

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,919
having that team did they also respond

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,039
to those issues as well is that yeah

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
part of that role okay excellent yeah

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,520
that's that's

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,799
that's awesome and like i love the

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,799
beautiful labels everywhere

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
i i have to enjoy working on it myself

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,640
so that's part of it

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,360
all right i'm gonna take a quick

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,320
commercial time out to look at my

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,399
whatsapp and we can see that it is ready

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,039
to go i'll make this smaller since uh

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,000
our heads are blocking a bit of that but

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,200
uh

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,679
yeah so i have i'm live and uh

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,520
let's see i did literally nothing except

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,840
uh install this

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
it looks like i need to do a migration

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,399
it's like

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,440
um yeah this doesn't look quite right it

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,159
looks like there wasn't

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:21,840
it used an old version um

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,399
try yeah so

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,960
tr run blitz db migrate you can you can

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,320
use mpx blitz steve or whatever

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,840
or yarn do you have yarn installed

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,799
uh i do okay so do yarn blitz

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,799
dv migrate

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,640
blitz not found i might have to try just

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,240
running

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:53,200
try running yarn maybe the dependencies

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,200
failed to install that's probably what

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,559
happened there's currently an issue

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,360
where the automatic dependency

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:08,480
installation fails in certain

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,480
network situations um

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,840
that's why and we have a we actually

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
have an open pr right now to make to

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,679
give you

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,640
a helpful error that says

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,000
versus the scoopy error stuff okay

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,679
excellent yeah that's

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,880
that's on me i need to start using the

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,080
later version of node

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,760
uh um that that's something anytime

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,919
if somebody wants to contribute to blitz

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
a great way is improving error messages

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,520
yeah we're like that's yeah that's

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,200
something that can always

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,200
that we always need to do and right now

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,799
it's a bit rough we'll we'll get that

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
all cleaned up before 1.0

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,679
yeah and i would encourage anybody who's

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,440
listening right now if you if you have a

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,159
terminal open uh feel free to do the

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,880
same thing i did

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,600
and document that uh that experience uh

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,840
because i think

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,520
that's some of my best contributions is

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,679
sort of introductions to teams

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,799
or the projects themselves is just

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
trying it out

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,200
and finding out some edge cases of

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,320
how how i think this should be and uh

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
i think the best thing is this opening

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,480
issue or jump into slack and see if

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,559
it is priority or if you could work on

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,000
it yourself

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,000
so i got the db migrate yeah so it

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,120
looked like it was the version number

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,720
and uh name of the migration if you have

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,919
any problems should i name this

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,159
first um no you can just hit enter oh

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,159
okay

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,559
excellent it looks like it's doing a lot

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,240
of stuff i haven't used prisma 2

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,640
so actually i have used personal too i

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,200
just i've only just cloned and

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,240
did a one commit to a project but that's

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
besides the fact

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,480
um yarn start it'll run let's start

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,480
gotcha

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,760
yeah it looks like tom broderick is

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
saying that he's using it for a

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,320
consulting project

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,120
and cannot say enough good things about

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,840
it so we got some blitz fans out

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,000
out here so we're gonna drive into the

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,840
local host

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,120
and here's my blitz congratulations i'm

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,320
blitzing

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,320
excellent and i see these generate

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,000
commands too as well so these are very

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
familiar to me for um

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,679
from rails it's been a while since i

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,200
actually started a new rails app

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,399
from scratch but yeah very familiar

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,039
um so you can sign up if you scroll up

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,320
to the top

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,600
click on sign up and just enter

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
it's not going to send an email so you

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,960
can just enter something all right

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
everybody's going to i guess i should

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,080
use my github email so everybody can

00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,399
dock me there instead of my personal

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
email

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,240
there we go and i'm logged in there

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
you're logged down so is this this is

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,720
staging like local

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,120
development environment that's where

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,679
that gets using sql lite by default

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,360
gotcha so because that works pretty much

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,519
pretty much every machine

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,279
um but i definitely recommend switching

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
to postgres locally and then using

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,039
postcrest

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,440
in production that is pretty awesome i

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,159
have

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,799
i've literally have login for a site

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,880
with no

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,240
no yeah bells and whistles i'd have to

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,960
pull another libraries or anything like

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,519
that

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,279
exactly so while we're talking about

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,480
authentication

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,120
it's also super easy to add um social

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,880
login

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,799
like via twitter facebook github

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,919
whatever we have a

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,919
an adapter for passport js which

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,399
there's like hundreds of passport.js

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,360
strategies that are already available

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
and so yeah we have a page in the docs

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,159
for under auth

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,880
under passport yep and so you literally

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,440
put one file in

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,559
and you just put in provide any pass4js

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
strategy

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,720
and then it will automatically work but

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,720
you you have you'll have to go set up

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,440
the oauth thing in github and

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,960
get the keys and all of that okay so um

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,240
i can't just copy and paste that and see

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,799
this work

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,799
no because because because of the keys

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,320
yeah all right something actually scroll

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,760
down yeah scroll down you'll see an

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,919
example of

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,279
twitter strategy so like yeah yeah so

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,600
you copy and paste that whole thing in

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,880
there

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,320
and add your keys and it just works

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,519
that's that's pretty nice i might

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,240
actually be working on this this

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,600
afternoon

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,480
uh anybody's interested i uh i live

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,480
stream

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,559
on this twitch handle uh i think there's

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,559
a github example on this page too

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,840
um i guess i can

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,080
passport authenticate github yeah i

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,120
haven't used passport.js

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,519
um farther i think there's a

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,840
full example yeah scroll up

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,840
right there um

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
okay maybe all right maybe oh it's

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,080
awesome he wrote that we had to not get

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,600
up i don't know what that's just

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,120
right there okay yeah yeah

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,640
but yeah it's basically the same thing

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,320
so yeah

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,760
excellent i'm familiar with zero that's

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,880
a great client for

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,559
managing uh authentication and uh yeah

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,960
just takes a one more sign up and then

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,840
you're

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,840
you're off to the races

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,320
in the chat said you took all the best

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,399
parts of javascript frameworks awesome

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
um that's what that's what like i've

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,200
been hearing uh someone else in

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,240
in the slack maybe it's just me it's the

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,440
same person i don't know but um they

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,720
they said they started out with ruby on

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,480
rails really liked

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,240
all of the uh like how that um

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,639
just like that experience and then they

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,480
used um

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,480
angular and they liked how that was like

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,280
all type script kind of the standard

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,560
and then they liked ember which was um

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,839
kind of a bit more of the rails

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,200
conventions and yeah

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,200
and things and and then react for

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,040
um just like react and stuff and then

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,240
basically blitz is like the combination

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,320
of all of these

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,440
the best parts about everything yeah so

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,240
could i ask about the

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
orm too as well and uh yeah since i do

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,200
have a user

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,760
like what would be the step to see

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,520
actually see the data

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,960
um run run yarn studio

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,520
and i'll run yarn um yeah go ahead and

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,920
run that

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,280
that'll run blitz db studio which uses

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,720
prisma studio

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,440
gotcha so click yup wow and there you

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,119
can see

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,359
amazing everything in your day yeah i

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,280
mean it's not understated and like look

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,320
here you see my hash password

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
good luck get cracking that one it's

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,079
actually pretty easy

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,240
but um it's nice to actually see this

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,000
because again like i

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,359
i don't wanna i i spend a lot of time

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,599
building like new projects

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,760
and like throwing together stuff really

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,520
quickly to see if things stick

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
uh in my i'm a developer advocate i get

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
up so like we don't i don't have a

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,359
long-standing projects

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,760
so if i want to do user off and set this

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,520
up

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
and then like get a nice prototype going

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,880
to get buy-in for other people to say

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
yes go ahead and do this

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,119
like this seems like hands down probably

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,680
the fastest way i've seen to do

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,680
database integration authentication i've

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
got react which i'm familiar with

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,680
uh and if i want to drop i guess

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
sprinkle in some css i guess

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,760
does that exist as well or what's

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,000
powering this uh this template

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
um right now it's just using it's using

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,599
style

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,280
jsx which comes but which comes in next

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,720
attached by default

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,760
um but you can so something else we have

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,599
is recipes

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,200
so do you uh do you know what do you

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,680
like using tailwind or

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,040
chakra or i am getting in the tailwinds

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,240
now so i have one project using

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,599
tailwinds and

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,599
it seems like the thing i'm probably

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,359
going to be sticking with for a bit

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,440
okay so you can go to the console and

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,880
run blitz install tailwind

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
and it'll install tailwind for you

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,119
automatically that mail is

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,920
amazing so what's what's powering that

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,359
then let's

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,000
install tailwind

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,640
so this is this is what we call a blitz

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,160
recipe

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:57,599
uh just a non without an s oh tailwind

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:01,280
um now no this is still alpha status

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,960
because it asks you about 50 000 times

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160
if you are if you're sure that you want

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,480
to keep doing this so you have to keep

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,920
pressing enter

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,720
um js code shift uh and uh

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,200
in the chat oh does it support firebase

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,240
off

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,320
that's a question that came in um i

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,760
if if there is a passport strategy for

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,240
firebase auth that would

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
work is that what the question is about

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,680
uh

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,960
yes does it support firebase oh yeah so

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,839
i'm guessing there is a

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,960
passport strategy for that yeah if so

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,280
yeah

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,800
the uh also the next question is the

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,800
school pin no say in glasto

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,810
[Music]

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,119
so we have a conference in spanish

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,920
that's going to be on this channel in

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,359
one hour

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,599
and uh people might be showing up a

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,200
little early for it and my spanish is

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,680
really bad so i apologize

00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,680
santo

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,040
do you offer videos in spanish

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,040
oh maybe the question was for you

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,560
um for me um no not yet

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:17,119
but we do so our we have a new

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,800
um design for the website that's being

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
finished right now and then we're gonna

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,320
we're gonna redo the website with the

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,800
whole new just a new design

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,599
um and once we get that done we have

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
we're gonna do

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,359
doc translations we have a issue in the

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,800
in the documentation

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,880
repo and there's already like probably

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,880
20 or maybe more people that are signed

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,680
up to help with translations for

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,200
a bunch of different languages so okay

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,599
that would be sweet to get in place

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,040
and uh ella he's thanks for the

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,920
translation too it was actually will the

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,040
videos be dubbed

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,880
in spanish um but yeah for the if you're

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,480
referring to the octagon's cons it

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,839
actually will be streamed in spanish and

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,000
english

00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,880
it was a great spanish attempt you know

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,320
yes but no spanish videos right now yeah

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,359
go ahead

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,280
this issue with your uh in your terminal

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,119
oh yeah i just completely missed that

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:15,839
yeah oh

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,839
there we are um looks like a

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,760
try install do yarn or yarn global ad

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,920
splits yeah i think that's probably what

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,680
the global ad

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,119
would yeah so i guess for the sake of

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,960
the listener i don't i didn't actually

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,400
install blitz on my machine

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,000
i was actually using the one that was

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,440
cached up in npm

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,119
so i should probably just have it

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,520
locally so i don't

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,240
get these edge cases no engine

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,520
compatible

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:46,800
am i still using dot

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,720
i want to use 14 because i think it's

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,000
the latest one i have

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,040
i did actually set the default but

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,240
there we go we'll try it one more time

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,480
the dependencies uh version management

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,800
is the uh the challenge today

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,079
so yeah these recipes are just one

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,400
command to install

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,839
any amount of code into your project um

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,680
so it's really great for these like

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,599
third-party library integrations

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
right now we have one for tailwind for

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,880
chakra for

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,680
emotion um so yeah so now try bliss

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,800
install

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,319
and we don't have very many yet

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,760
but we want to add we want to have like

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,960
hundreds of these so basically

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
everything if you're familiar with

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,839
nextjs

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
all the next js examples in their repo

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,599
like with this

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,440
with x with y we want to have all those

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,520
recipes so it's just one command

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,119
yeah yeah so go ahead and press enter

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,240
yep and then

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,599
i was talking about you have to keep

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,839
pressing enter like 50 times okay

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,040
sure are you sure the um that'd be a

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,560
nice little uh

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,640
contribution if anybody wants to open

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,119
that issue uh some questions

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,000
uh does it support uh password resets

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,520
natively or is that also a password

00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
we so we don't have the code like for

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
in new apps by default yet we probably

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,319
will at some point

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,920
um but it's relatively simple to do like

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,839
you we have the functions there you just

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,880
need to write a a mutation that says

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,640
reset and then

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,200
you make sure the passwords match and

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,240
whatever you want to do

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,359
yeah it looks like i guess zsc zs h is

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,560
um

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,760
has auto suggestions uh yeah i'm not

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,400
using zsh

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,720
um so is strange to me don't have auto

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,960
suggestions i think he's if you

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,160
yeah the blitz auto commit or auto

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,560
complete command

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,079
that will add auto suggest or add auto

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,920
complete for whatever terminal you're

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,800
in yeah okay well i guess it does have

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,400
autocomplete

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,200
but um i don't have the zsh like the

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
you can see it typing before like the um

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,760
i know what they're talking about

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,640
i don't use it so i do not explain it

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,839
but yes i'm using bare bones terminal

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,800
because that's the way i roll um but it

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,160
looks like we

00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,359
ended up react era boundary

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,720
i think this worked actually yeah

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:06,640
yeah it looks like it yeah so it'll um

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,640
and like if there's tailwind doesn't

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,640
have it doesn't have a theme provider

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,319
but emotion does for example in chakra

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,520
and so if it has a theme provider it'll

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,160
automatically add that

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,079
in your app at the correct place so it's

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,880
pretty slick

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,800
yeah and the for the sake of folks

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,079
questions about prettier and eslint

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,440
uh by default is that also yes lives in

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,240
here and just

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,760
yep and just okay cool so like getting

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,760
the the basics up and running

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,359
if you want the right test can husky get

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,319
hooked so that it automatically formats

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,319
your code when you commit

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,440
excellent

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,000
yeah server side render or client side

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,200
by default this question

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,319
um page by default pages are client-side

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,040
rendered

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,240
it's like in the new app the login um

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,880
and sign up stuff are

00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,720
our client-side rendered but you can

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,720
easily switch between them

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,880
um as you want excellent

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,920
yeah so i wanted the transition to talk

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,640
more about the issues

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,400
real quick uh that was fascinating that

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,760
i was able to get that much done i've

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,440
i've imagined i could probably get a

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
pretty sweet site up and running pretty

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,680
quickly

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,640
um just seeing that i can look up blitz

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,960
recipes

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,920
um i guess my one quick question is the

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,920
blitz recipes

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
how is it in the documentation on how to

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,760
build those yourself if you want to

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,040
integrate it

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,040
yeah it is yeah and it is

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,440
it's not necessarily easy because you're

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,720
you're working with um asts

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,280
like bible transform stuff um but we're

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
gonna

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,319
we're gonna be adding like more and more

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,280
um

00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,640
easier like function so like a function

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,760
right now we have a function for adding

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,920
a dependency so that's

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,760
that's easy yeah um scroll down you can

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,960
see the recipe builder

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,599
um and then we'll we'll add commands for

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,200
like

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,880
add a provider so that would be easy

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,599
right now it's pretty pretty difficult

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,240
but okay and does next currently have

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,440
plugins as well

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,160
um they well they have like

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,960
what people typically call as plugins as

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,720
you just

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,680
you wrap like the um the next config

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,480
object yeah so you can be like with with

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,599
whatever

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,240
so that's that same thing works in blitz

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,440
okay actually yeah i don't have a lot of

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,599
experience in the

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,880
like specifically in next gs i only just

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,440
have like one app so

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,880
it's the majority of this is new for me

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,280
so i'm like actually pretty excited to

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,280
jump in

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,000
um question from tom is uh in the chat

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:46,079
uh what sort of milestones are needed to

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,720
go from alpha to beta good question

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,240
um i'm not sure actually

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
i've been thinking mostly in terms of

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,160
what he's done for 1.0

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,200
but i should think about what what

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,960
exactly

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,319
um is alpha the beta um

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,640
i need to think about that more but

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,839
we're pretty close to beta status

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,640
um there's there's a few things um so

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,359
like the pr

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,000
open right now to add a used mutation

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,839
hook

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,520
which fixes um the roughest part in

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,040
blitz right now which is

00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,319
how you type these the context parameter

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,440
which is how you get the session

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,200
inside your queries and mutations um

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,480
so this once we get this this will be

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,440
like a big

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,440
kind of a big step of

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,160
there being less issues looks like it's

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,400
adding 50 bytes i'm not to look into

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,400
that

00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,800
excellent yeah actually i really like

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,280
this action um

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,640
i have it on one project and uh it's

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,839
nice to see

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,760
what you're sort of bringing into the

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,720
mix uh i've been very

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
very um i guess cautious on adding in

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,520
new

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,359
files and projects that add a lot of

00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,800
like too much weight to my project

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,240
mainly because i do a lot of i do a lot

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,160
of streaming like this and a lot of the

00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,640
projects i use as browser sources

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,440
so i'm very very cautious on things like

00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,880
that

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,599
um how easy would it be handled um

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,319
handled api through rails and mount

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,000
blitz

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,920
for the client on top of like a

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,960
webpacker or similar

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,839
so if

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,560
i'm i'm assuming you have an existing

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,160
rails app

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,920
that you're wanting to use because um

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,200
blitz basically replaces the need for

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,160
github as an or

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,160
rails as an api because blitz is your

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,520
like api layer if you want

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,880
if you want to call it that um so to

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,359
actually answer your question

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
i think would probably be difficult yeah

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,000
you actually

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,599
mount it on top of rails using webpacker

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,200
yeah it sounds like you'd probably

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,960
want to use this or something yeah just

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,640
regular next js yeah

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,480
um yeah because i think what you get for

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,000
free from blitz is that sort of

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,040
connection to the database in the back

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,319
end all in one structure as a monolith

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,319
uh but if you're already coming with the

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,760
back end uh that you want to create your

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,640
own monolith with

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
yeah and embedding react or even next

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,280
into that project

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,560
um would probably be the way to go which

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,760
i don't know there's a very clear path

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,920
for that today

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,800
i'm very moved removed from the rails

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,480
environment or

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,880
rails community um

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,040
other question is authentication state

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,240
maintained by browser session or api

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,319
tokens

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,440
um it is using cooking-based

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,079
authentication

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,640
uh session authentication right now so

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,559
um

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,240
we will i think we'll add an advanced

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,880
authentication option that uses

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,240
um actual jwts right now it's using

00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,839
opaque tokens that are stored in the

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,040
database so this is very

00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,880
basically the same way that rails

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,040
laravel does it

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,079
um but it's that's all handled for you

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,960
you don't have to

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,960
really know about it

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,880
cool yeah the um yeah mike was just

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,040
mentioned about the uh

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,640
deep check to you to look for unused

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,760
packages and libraries in your your

00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,920
project which

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,440
i'm a fan of like i'm always i love

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,319
deleting stuff it makes me look

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,200
look cool you know green green squares

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,880
for life

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,280
just kidding um yeah so

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,559
uh anything else i guess to keep people

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,240
informed like you got the good first

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,319
issue you got good second issue

00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,319
uh did you want to look at a good issue

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,720
um just sort of walk through people what

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,160
the

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,160
sort of the cases

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,920
um but can i i don't care

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,640
i don't necessarily have anything yeah i

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,480
mean it's uh

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,079
it was fascinating to see some of the

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,640
open pr's to see the structure of the

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,079
project

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,240
and like get a good understanding of

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,200
like it's like i could not state an

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,160
understated like

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,720
overstated enough like actually using

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,200
blitz

00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,040
is probably first step in contributing

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,800
uh because once you've used it you

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,319
like i just saw like i saw that there

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,319
was some sort of

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,920
rough edge cases on like the error

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,520
messages that are coming through

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
uh mainly because i didn't update my

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,760
note version um

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,400
and yeah that's like a great first place

00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,839
like if i

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,920
if i had the bandwidth i would be

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,480
opening up that issue and then i would

00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,559
wait

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,040
uh we already we already have a pr open

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,119
for that one so you already have a pr

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,400
oh uh let's take a look at that because

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,160
i'm curious uh

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,720
if that sort of exposes a bit of how the

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,119
um the cli works too as well

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,839
uh let's see prompt to choose database

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,280
and

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,880
scroll up it's probably one of the top

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,880
ones um

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:31,839
make sure add new

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,839
okay scroll down

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,960
scroll down are these ordered by

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,880
updated uh i think they're ordered by

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:46,079
yeah i think they get ordered by updated

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,319
perhaps that's my uh because that's

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,160
maybe we don't have a maybe someone is

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,200
just working on it and the pr isn't

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,880
actually open yet

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,880
that could be actually i am sorted

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,160
sorting by newest

00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,599
okay yeah okay but yeah

00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,160
something's up something to definitely

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,160
check out um someone asked about uh

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,240
blitz

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,359
oh i guess there was a response to that

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,280
uh

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,880
is blitz recommendation around handling

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,960
global state in local state

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,599
or consuming an api um yeah

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,240
so we don't have any recommendations for

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,040
global

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,640
and local state um other than like just

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,599
personally i would recommend checking

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,520
out

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,040
dustin or is it joy they're they're both

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,400
projects from the react screen

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,200
organization or community or whatever

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,839
um so those look those are pretty sweet

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,359
and

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,680
for consuming api you don't have to

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,200
um really worry about an api because

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,000
blitz takes care of that for you

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,760
but we do use react query under the hook

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,280
under the hood so our use query hook

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,920
and then our coming use mutation hook

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,480
is blood on built on top of react query

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,760
and

00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,319
that handles all of the uh caching of

00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,680
the api responses internally from blitz

00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,760
so you don't have to really think about

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
that that caching or that fetching or

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,839
anything

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,960
but it's single for you yeah i do want

00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,520
to mention that we're going to actually

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,680
have react

00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,960
tanner from react query uh on the stream

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,200
next week uh so

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,880
sweet if you want to uh see that

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,839
conversations hit follow on the channel

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,839
and you'll get a notification

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,000
um so the next question there was can

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:26,400
bliss be used as an api server including

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,359
auth or exhaust tied to the front end um

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
so currently

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,520
the built-in session management is

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,760
cookie based it can work with

00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,119
um so typically you're not you don't

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
want to do cookie based

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,720
cookie cookie-based authentication or

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,280
session management for apis

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,920
strictly you'd want to use like a token

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,400
off

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,240
and you can add that so you can add um

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,720
token author via middleware we have

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,880
ability to add any type of middleware

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,960
into your queries and mutations

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,800
so you can do that and then the other

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,119
thing is we have a regular

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,119
plain api routes that are just a it's

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,680
just a straight node request response

00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,760
thing and you can do whatever you want

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,760
there you can add a graphql server there

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,240
um if you want or

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:13,359
so it's um it's very flexible

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,880
cool and uh someone from github impress

00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,760
here too as well i don't recognize the

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,599
name but uh

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,760
thanks for stopping by and uh we look

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,920
forward to seeing uh blitz being cloned

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,760
and uh leveraged and uh

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,200
inside of github i'm just kidding that

00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,079
was actually one of the responses to the

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,599
twitter

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,839
is when github is going to start using

00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,559
blitz we would definitely need to come

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,880
out of beta

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,839
just like how github is built on rails

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,920
uh today

00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:40,319
i would love for like yeah in five ten

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,640
years there to be like a github

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,319
like a large company that starts on

00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,839
blitz today and then

00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,839
they're like this big company using

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,880
blitz yeah that's like a lot of the

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,960
frameworks that are

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,400
super successful i think react is kind

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,359
of the inverse because react

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,319
started inside of facebook but having

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,200
someone using it

00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,000
and sort of pushing like even answering

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,000
the question around what

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
are the next steps for between alpha and

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,599
and beta uh

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,040
a lot of those get dictated by the needs

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,079
of people who are actually

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,319
sort of pushing it to the edges and like

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,000
the bounds and like for what i see i

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,520
think you sort of like embedded a lot of

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,119
well you just get a lot of the next js

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,640
stuff for free uh by

00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,920
building the the connections um together

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,079
but uh like it it seems pretty mature

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,680
for me uh for like the side projects i

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,760
run uh to basically

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,760
like simply get this authentication

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,160
running if i wanted to move on to

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,000
off zero i see a path there i see a path

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,240
for my css

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,359
style sheets and stuff like that uh

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,839
graphql was mentioned

00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,200
prisma's already attached like getting

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,720
something up and running like

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,960
if you work at an agency it seems like

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,119
if you had to do sites every single week

00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,520
like this would be the thing

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,839
grab and ship yeah yep which is amazing

00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,800
yeah so we get a lot of uh yeah blitz is

00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,119
looks cool

00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,280
so definitely check it out yeah go ahead

00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,440
what one thing that'll be uh

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,119
just cool to mention here briefly is um

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,680
blitz definitely takes the monolithic

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,760
approach

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,000
to building apps like ruby and rails and

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,480
laravel um do

00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,200
but the the most people are like kind of

00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,200
uh

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,640
bristle out of monolith because of its

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,680
scalability like oh

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,319
it doesn't scale um and so you

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,960
definitely

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,079
you can run blitz uh as a server or

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,839
serverless

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,079
so if you run blitz as a server you have

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,119
the same type of monolith scaling things

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,280
to deal with

00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,040
but you can also deploy blitz serverless

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,000
and so all of your like queries and

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,240
mutations are

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,359
individual serverless functions and so

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,079
they'll scale automatically and

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,440
independently

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,680
you can deploy to versailles you can

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,359
deploy to aws

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,000
um i think you can even deploy to

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,400
netlify if you set it up correctly

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,079
um and then of course you can deploy to

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,119
render to heroku

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,640
to regular ec2 instance so it's super

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
flexible in deployment

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,040
um but i think that's like that's a

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,079
really good thing for

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,000
for blitz compared to like rails where

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,359
once once you get a really big app then

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,880
people are like i don't

00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,960
want to deal with this with rails but

00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640
blitz that should be better

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,880
yeah because of being able to run a

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,119
server list yeah that's um

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,160
i mean you're you're you're saying all

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,319
the things i need to hear

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,400
to be excited about this and like i know

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,119
we had this conversation actually on my

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,720
podcast

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,280
uh previously i haven't actually checked

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,520
out blitz uh for any projects now but

00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,359
you've convinced me to to install brit

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,799
blitz on the command line here i've got

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,920
my own project here

00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,640
which is uh me being live and doing

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,280
blitz

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,680
um so i've got some some work to do and

00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,640
uh

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,079
i'm curious if people have um split

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,799
sides so they want to actually

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,640
um uh like share their projects is there

00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:49,599
a place to sort of like showcase

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,359
uh their blitz they're currently there

00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,960
they show and tell channel and slack and

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,079
then there's also the wiki click on the

00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,520
wiki at the top

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,079
bar up here um yeah so this is just a

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,400
public

00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,480
wiki anybody can add stuff to it so

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,079
there's you can see um

00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
there's like architectural patterns apps

00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,640
that are made with splits that are in

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,960
production right now

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,680
um podcasts there's our podcast jam

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,799
stack radio

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,880
so everybody listened that one uh you're

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,000
talking about talks meetups etc you know

00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,040
honestly i never even thought

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,640
to use wikis this way this is a

00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,040
yeah this is excellent i look forward to

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,920
um this uh live stream actually getting

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,440
added to this list

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,720
as well and uh yeah it looks like

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,520
there's some opportunity right here for

00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,960
tutorials and

00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,480
courses so anybody yep

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,319
excellent and then we we didn't even

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,920
touch on discussions because

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:40,480
you said you had access to discussions

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,319
too as well yep so what can people use

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,040
discussions for um so anything that's

00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,960
especially like rfcs for new features

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,119
the if it's just a tiny improvement

00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,880
and i have it this is in the docs too

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,440
and how the community operates

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,359
um but small little changes can just be

00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,599
a regular github issue but bigger larger

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,799
like add a new hook or add to some new

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,119
feature

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,160
post it up as an rfc like you know take

00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,400
some time to put in

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,760
exactly like how you think it could work

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,760
how could be implemented

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,040
um so forth and then also just like

00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,119
questions

00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,400
um so that these are nice because we can

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,079
anybody can link to them

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,200
review them etc so i recommend

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,119
um if you have questions or problems

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,280
put it in the github discussion and then

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,799
you can also drop the link in slack

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,640
because we don't notifications aren't

00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,440
