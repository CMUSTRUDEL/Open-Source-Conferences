Title: docs.github.com - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2020-10-19
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	We open sourced GitHub’s product documentation to help demonstrate that it’s possible (and beneficial) for private companies to open source their products. GitHub has open sourced hundreds of projects over the years, but docs.github.com is the first private production service that we’ve migrated into the open. We hope that our application design, automation workflows, and openness to external contributions can be a model for other organizations that want to open up their private projects and benefit from community collaboration.

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,519

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,679
i'm here we had a great evening last

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,880

and chatting about um apis but today

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,599
we're talking about documentation

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,920
with janice hey janice hello

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
hey janice uh janice is coming in from

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,119
uh

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
well you would think that was a virtual

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,520
background but it's actually a real

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
background

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,559
it's real excellent so yeah do you want

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
to give us an introduction on what you

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
do

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,719
at github uh what you do in regards to

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,000
documentation as well and

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,160
even how you got here yeah so i

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
uh recently transitioned into being a

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,800
product manager at github

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
uh and i am working on the docs open

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,559
source project so we just opened source

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
the docs a week and a half ago and it

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,320
has been a whirlwind

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
experience ever since then uh before

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
that i was a

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
content writer so i was a technical

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
writer at github uh for about a year and

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
a half

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,960
um so i've been there for a while in

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
tech time before that like

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
long ago i actually have a degree in

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,159
theater and worked as

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,680
a middle school and high school theater

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,960
teacher

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,920
and then got into tech through

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
the outreachy program which works with

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,360
people from marginalized groups to get

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
into transition into tech

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,960
it was one of the few places that would

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
help somebody that wasn't a student get

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
into tech which was what i was really

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,119
looking for

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,439
when i was looking to transition and

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
then i worked on gulp js which is

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,759
another open source project

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,520
uh and then found my way to github i

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
applied and never

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,720
assumed that anyone would like read my

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,759
resume let alone hire me but here i am

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,520
excellent yeah and um um yeah it's

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,439
fascinating that transition and

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
we we literally just talked with megan

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,759
last week from gatsby

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
about uh their transition from

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,520
going from teaching to also doing

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
documentation which it seems to

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
be a common thread and i think with

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,920
documentation

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
there's a lot of teaching that happens

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
correct oh yeah so

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
when you're writing documentation you

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,720
really focus on your user you focus on

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
who is reading your docs and how they

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,360
are going to access the information

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
and what the progression is so there's

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
this concept in education called

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
background knowledge and like what does

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
your user know already

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
and what pieces do you need to fill in

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
and if you don't understand those things

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
as a technical writer

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,680
like you're just not going to write

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
great docs yeah yeah indeed

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
and um yeah i i appreciate good

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,000
documentation i

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,239
i i enjoyed gatsby's documentation i use

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,760
a lot of github's documentation as well

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,319
um as uh gatsby's documentation is

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,280
beautiful it is some of the first great

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,760
docs that i read

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
that are more accessible to new users

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,959
than i think

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
anyone else's that's like a missing

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,280
piece in this open source

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,400
world is like brand new people yeah i

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
was going to say too as well

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
the um so i used to work for a company

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,560
called netlify as well and we have a

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,040
great documentation

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
engineer as well um which you might know

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
jessica over there

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
um uh what i think she has actually has

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
a team now at this point

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,319
uh i i worked when we were much smaller

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
um but i think even when we were

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,159
creating documentation at that company

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,519
we looked around and tried to figure out

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
yeah who's doing it well

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,440
uh and like we named a couple of folks

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,360
and just always

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,840
it's always great to see people doing it

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,760
well and people actually

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,159
taking like the education piece of it

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,799
and like

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
taking people along for the ride um like

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
with great care

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,920
and that's what i appreciate with github

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,480
stocks like i know how to reference

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,040
things and i've seen github stocks also

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,200
um evolve as well like if anybody's um

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
anybody's seen the github docs recently

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
um you can see it looks quite different

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
than what it used to like even

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
what six months ago uh which i'm super

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
appreciative um

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
shout out to zeke who's in the chat too

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
welcome man who's

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
on the team that does the engineering

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
for the docs

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400
yeah zeke has done so much work getting

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
us to the point of open source if you

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
want the

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,360
nitty gritty details he wrote a amazing

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
blog post about how

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
um we worked all the way through like

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,120
this has been a

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,600
multi-year long process to get open

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
sourced

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
and he explained how we got there in a

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
blog post

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,720
wednesday it shipped wednesday

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
oh nice um

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
yeah i thought that was gonna happen let

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,720
me uh re re-paste that

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,919
link uh what happens is uh we actually

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
have to block links

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,639
for folks i tried making zika vip before

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
he posted that and then uh we had a race

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
condition

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,440
um but yeah we'll get you we'll get you

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
in there and zeke

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
um but yeah what i'm getting at is the

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
um

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
yeah there's a lot a lot happening in

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
the github documentation so

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
since you've been working on it for

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
quite some time uh

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,919
like what's some sort of highlights and

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,360
the changes that we've seen not just

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,479
open source but just seeing it within

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
the documentation like any sort of

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,000
things that you want to point out

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,080
yeah so um i think about six months ago

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
we went through the process of we had

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
two separate documentation sites we had

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
a developer.githu

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
dot docs i don't even know what the

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
website was anymore we did a developer

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
site

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,199
and i had like api content and more of

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,039
that and integration stuff

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
and then we had the regular site and

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
there was this disconnect

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
that users didn't even necessarily know

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,039
that both of these things existed a lot

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,160
of people used one or the other

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,639
and so now they're all combined into

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
this docs.github.com site so you can

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,199
find everything you need to

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
to use github as well as you can um in

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,840
one place and so that was a

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,919
huge huge effort um figuring out how to

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
make all of those things work together

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,320
we've also done a lot of work localizing

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,440
content so at the very top there's a

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,280
language picker

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,120
and so we have yep there's english and

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,479
simplified chinese japanese spanish and

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,160
brazilian portuguese

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,800
and so um you can see these docs all

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,560
in different languages some of them so

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,120
we work with an integration called

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,240
crowdin

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,360
and so when we update content um the

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,360
writers update content

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,720
and then it goes to crowded and then our

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
translators translate those things and

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
then they come back so sometimes there's

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
some lag depending on

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,759
on what we're working on okay yeah so

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,160
like when i'm looking at this i see

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
uh the giant simplified charities here

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
and then

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,680
uh this is being in english oh looks

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,880
like i got this 503

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,240
all right not sure what happened there

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,919
but here we go open an issue

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
there we go seek fix it

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
uh yeah so sometimes it'll be in english

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,520
and that's the reason unfortunately

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,960
we're not taking uh localization updates

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
in the open source repo yet we're

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
and um

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,160
but yeah in regards to the documentation

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
that's um

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,919
that's huge and that's that's pretty

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,039
cool to see um the different languages

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,400
um i want to talk about oh sorry go

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,840
ahead

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,840
nope i wouldn't say anything what are

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
you saying well it seems like i'm saying

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
everything right now but i was just

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
going to talk about the fact that we

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,120
just open sourced the documentation

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,160
last week yeah yeah last week it was

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
only last week

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,680
um even though it feels like it's been

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,960
three years it was

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,639
last wednesday um so this is this was a

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,199
really cool project right so

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,879
we actually excuse me we're working in

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,520
two separate repos we have a docs

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
internal repo where we're still writing

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,879
documentation that isn't ready to be

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
public yet and then we have this public

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
docs repo

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,800
and we've got this great application

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
called rebosync which is also open

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
sourced and it takes the two and

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,640
syncs everything together so the git

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959
commits commit history and everything in

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,919
the file structure all syncs between

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,560
both repos automatically using actions

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
um

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,920
so we can work in both places

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,760
and we can get all of these great open

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
source contributions and we can still do

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
some of our work behind the scenes that

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
needs to be done

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
excellent repo sync you know it's funny

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,880
you bring this up because i was actually

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
writing something for this

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
and um you know hold on let me uh

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
fix zeke again because i feel like

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,399
you're gonna have a lot of

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,040
knowledge bombs to uh to share with us

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,040
do it zeke

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,920
all right sorry we're gonna we'll figure

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
this out oh there it is

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,839
yeah i think in the future we need to um

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,000
[Music]

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,000
oh he keeps you keep beating me too uh

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,760
beating me to uh trying to get you

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,760
one of the valuable players within

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,640
why is bonnie okay

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,800
yeah so zeke we won't be able to do um

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
to do any more link sharing but um

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,959
perhaps you can slack janice and janice

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,440
can um can help us out there

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,160
um but yeah for now we'll we'll move on

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
uh

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
to this the repo sync and the reposting

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
being also i think i could probably just

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,079
copy and paste that link again for zeke

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,519
he's gonna

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,360
he's taking time out of his busy

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:18,640
engineering schedule to

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,640
get banned by a bot

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
yeah we've been having uh our own

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
thought issues

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
uh bots are always so good until they

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,560
stop working

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,839
yeah and ruin everything and speaking of

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,600
bots too as well so

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,959
it's funny that i see this and like we

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,320
literally work for the same company

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,800
i was writing something um it's very

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,240
similar to this uh this reposting thing

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,040
which okay mine i don't think my project

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
really uh it works that well uh it's

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,440
pretty inconsistent

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,959
uh but i've had to do the same thing

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
where i need to sync the repos across

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
different um

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,839
organizations um because we're yeah

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,959
don't have to go into details but yeah

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,760
i am going to uh save this one for later

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
yeah yeah so zeke found a similar open

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
source project i think it was called

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
paul

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
by a user named way and we worked with

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,959
him and he

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
created repo sync um to do all the

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,079
school stuff for us so it's open source

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
and anybody can go snag it and

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,320
do i think it's at doc slash

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,399
repo hyphen sync um and so

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
anyone can yeah it's

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
are you talking about the uh the repo

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
itself the repo sync

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
is there so we have another org called

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,480
docs which is all open sourced

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
and repo sync lives in there

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,240
yeah actually let's grab the uh

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
github oh interesting yeah

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
so this is where our liquid markdown

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,519
which is how we version things

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,000
and i believe repo sync is in here

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,000
somewhere

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,440
oh man or i'm going to be wrong

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,760
i'm wrong all right oh so

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,040
it so zeke's in here and he's spelling

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
out he's learned his lesson

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,079
[Laughter]

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
and he's now spelling out the links for

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
us

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,279
okay which is appreciated thank you i

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,399
couldn't remember i've stopped my head

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,399
there it is

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,760
it's repo sync yeah in the future we'll

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
have to get a list of folks that we need

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,440
to actually get into mod

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,320
level um so that way we don't have to we

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,519
don't get stuck

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,920
uh in bot jail

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
yeah so this is the project anybody can

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,839
borrow it and use it it's got some

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,120
some great docs i believe written by

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,760
zeke and way

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
uh explaining how to use it to sync your

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,399
repos

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,720
yeah and real quick i'm gonna answer

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
that that one question uh which do we

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
have a calendar

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,399
uh for future streams and that's a great

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,760
question um

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
i think that was a small brute

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,720
these uh twitch handles always get me

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,959
i actually pronounced one earlier today

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
was uh kind of a tongue-in-cheek joke

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,760
and uh

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,399
i regret saying it out loud so i need to

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
slow down a bit

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,720
but uh yeah so going back to our share

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
and talking about repo sync

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,399
i just dropped a link to our our meetup

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,200
page which we do plan ahead

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,880
um all these streams and the the events

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
that we do uh specifically the virtual

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,959
events so it encompasses

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,800
not just what we do on twitch it does

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,560
what we also do on youtube as well

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,800
so check it out join that group and um

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,720
pretty good pronounced this is a smaller

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,160
boot all right

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,120
excellent um yeah so repo sync is now

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,000
it's its own organization and its own

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
repo

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,680
keep a pair of github repos syncs which

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
is

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,040
genius and zeke being the uh the

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
prolific open source contributor and

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,720
maintainer himself

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
has graciously put this in a place that

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,000
we can all share and delight alongside

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
of it so

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,040
since we spent so much time just trying

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
to get to this page

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,560
i'll drop that in the chat too as well

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,920

on the github twitch channel we need a

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,000
pronunciation button

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,959
so that everyone can explain how to

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
pronounce their handles

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,399

time

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,079
and he's been doing text to code not

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,760
text code voice to code

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,079
so i think you could use the uh like the

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,560
azure cognitive

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,120
voice thing and uh be able to do that

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
way

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
but if you do the inverse text to speech

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
i think i can actually write a command

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,720
to make that happen

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
uh i spent some time i spent some time

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
making some twitch integrations

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
in the last couple weeks they're always

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,920
wrong though somebody always says their

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
handle in their head differently

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,680
than i assume it is but that's always

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
wrong i think that's the fun of it

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,360
though

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
like leading into it

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,720
okay yeah yeah we we took a took a bit

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,600
of a detour uh talk about reposting

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
uh this is literally a lot of action so

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,519
um

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,199
folks if you wanted to see a project

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,320
that is using actions

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,279
um triage issue comments

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,959
yeah so um we the goal is to set

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,199
everything up so you know we want to be

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,720
really responsive and be

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,720
available for all of these awesome

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
contributions that we're getting and so

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,680
right now i am the person triaging and

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,519
uh the goal is that i don't always have

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,959
to be the only person triaging the

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,920
primary person triaging and that people

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,160
can dip in and out

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,759
and participate in that um so this

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,880
action takes everything

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,720
uh i think this one's new issues uh new

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,079
issues reopened issues and issues of new

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,560
comments by contributors

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
yeah and it throws them onto a project

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,279
board which is also public

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,440
and adds a triage label um so

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,720
then i see those in the project board

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
and i can

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,399
take a glance at them and figure out

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,160
what team from the docs

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
like what sub team on the docs team

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,279
should look at the issue

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
yeah that is uh that is amazing and uh

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
i'm a big fan

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,920
of leveraging actions to do some of the

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,040
automation um

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
actually yeah i've been doing a lot of

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
talk about actions recently

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,199
and uh always looking for examples so i

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
might be uh stalking this uh project

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,120
pretty heavily in the future uh yeah

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,120
yeah there's a bunch

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,040
uh of our trade all the triage ones are

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
together and then we also use a lot of

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
action

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
a lot of actions to test um and make

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,279
sure that

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:47,360
prs aren't going to break anything um

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,519
we've got a lot of actions going on yeah

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
yeah talk about actions i see at the the

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
l11y

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
action as well which i assume is testing

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
just uh

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,480
interaction um thinking the

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,480
search too as well uh that's a nice one

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,439
that i get i guess a lot of people don't

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,120
think about like hashing searching um

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,240
and it looks like algolia is the what

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,799
power is the search

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,360
um shout out to them algolia does they

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,360
are great

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,600
uh so everything one of the big things

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
is that when we we have a staging so if

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,400
you open

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319
a pr um you can actually see your

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,600
changes on a staging server

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,640
which also pops up automatically um

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,840
and we kept forgetting that you have to

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
actually

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
uh push your changes let's see about

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,039
pull requests yeah that's an article

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
and if you scroll down uh keep going

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,039
view deployments on the right side

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,080
yeah welcome back is great right there

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,240
where'd you go right there

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,480
that view deployments on the right side

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,080
and that'll take you to a staged version

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,120
of the changes and so you can see all of

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,799
your changes

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
for real what they really really look

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,600
like and you can click through any

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,880
article and the only thing that's not

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
going to work is search because

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
you need that action to run algolia

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,880
before you can see those changes

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,400
yeah it's kind of pretty janky there

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah which makes sense yeah

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,919
uh just real quick if people did not

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,400
really realize what just happened here

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
this view the deployment um i know this

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
because i actually

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
gave a whole github universe talk about

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,400
the deployments api um

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,760
and it's a way for you to actually see

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,559
the environments um

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,760
that are literally on for your your

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,280
environment so

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
um for free you get this for get up

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
pages but it looks like we're using

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,280
heroku

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,720
uh in this instance uh looks like

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
someone turned off the environment side

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,400
which is fine

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,320
but uh normally if the environment side

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
uh list was actually

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
enabled you could see all the uh

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
deployments that are active

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,600
um yeah you can see also down here you

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,799
can see the latest environment which is

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
gonna link

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,400
from here as well excellent i love that

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,480
heroku has integrated that in their bot

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
yeah it's been um it was really

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,840
important for us so as

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,200
writers on the writing team this is

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,320
something that we use a lot you know you

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
make a change

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,880
and especially because we're writing in

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
markdown if you're doing something like

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
a table which can get so

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,000
complicated and silly if you have a

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
space in the wrong place or you forget a

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,799
pipe

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
your table is just completely busted so

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
being able to go in and actually see

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
that

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
uh on the staging environment and really

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,559
understand what your changes are and

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
compare them to the existing article

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,760
is really valuable and we wanted to make

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
sure that our uh our

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,919
contributors could have that experience

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,080
as well yeah

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,600
excellent yeah i mean it's it's always

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
good to know like

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
and i love that the you have the welcome

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,240
bot you've got other things to help

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,760
like help people uh

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
zeke just turned on the environments in

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,280
the sidebar as well

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,720
wow asking yourself receive 371

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,919
environment so like this is an active

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
project right here this is what i was

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,400
looking for

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,160
zeke being the uh one of the admins on

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
the the repo can do this for us

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
uh no need to actually go and check this

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,679
but more of the

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
for the the listeners who were not aware

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,080
that you can actually set with the

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,600
deployments api

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,280
your different environments uh

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,200
definitely take advantage of that

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
i built i know this because i also built

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,480
one for netlify

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
which is called loglify which you can

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,600
get your your netify logs

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,520
uh directly in the environments um it's

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,360
a homework for the the listener to go

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,880
google that i won't continue to flex my

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,880
own stuff but uh

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,159
uh small small brute you you ask about

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
the neural search

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,799
um stream coming uh if you know somebody

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,159
feel free to enter us

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,559
this is our our github meetup invite

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,159
this is my twitter as well uh so you can

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,600
reach out to me directly if you know of

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
a project i'm happy to reach out to them

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,960
and talk about it

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,320
um so far we've actually i've asked all

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,679
my friends to come on and talk about

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,640
their projects and

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,000
um so i'm happy to make new friends and

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,000
talk about their projects as well

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,840
dota dota 2 is to say the more

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,400
environments the better right it's like

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,760
pokemon

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,280
yes indeed yeah and i love this um

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
like being able to contribute to the

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,720
documentation in positive ways

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
what are sort of like low-hanging fruit

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
for people to contribute to like what

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
are like the biggest needs for the

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,400
documentation

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,159
uh today so um we've got a couple of

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,480
areas of focus so

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,400
uh if you look at the issues we've got

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,559
content issues which are things that

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,000
change the words on the docs page

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,919
and then we've got engineering issues

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,480
which are focused on the site

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,360
or maybe actions or workflows or

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,679
something like that

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,200
um so those are all available depending

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,480
on what you feel confident about

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,559
our site is mostly you know you probably

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,159
need to know some javascript some yaml

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,919
um it's written in it's a node app um

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
and then our content is all marked down

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
with some liquid versioning

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
so the goal was for that to be really

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,240
accessible and available to people who

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,440
are maybe trying out pull requests and

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,960
issues and all of these things for the

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,000
very first time i know that it can be

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
really overwhelming

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
to try to start figuring out how to get

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
involved in open source and and get

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,960
involved in github

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,159
so any content issues that we've put out

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
we've tried to give

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
sort of an understanding of this is what

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,600
the change is and and this is sort of

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,960
what we're looking for in that change

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,320
and then you're welcome to open a pull

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,520
request and if you have any

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,159
questions you can open a discussion um

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,200
ask in your full request i am there

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,400
people have been

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,159
confused and and i understand it is

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
a lot to try to figure out all at one

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,320
time yeah and like

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,080
i feel like the best way to get involved

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
in open source i mean for me personally

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,360
i know

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
uh past uh performance is not uh

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,799
guaranteed for future growth

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
uh which i have a finance degree i don't

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,360
know if you can tell but um

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,080
what i'm getting at is that i like using

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,280
the things

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,280
uh and by using the projects i'm able to

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,960
um so i'm now seeing dota's comment

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,799
about friends in 2020 what a serious

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
brag

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,919
which uh you know we're we're all going

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
through different walks of life right

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,200
now it's just

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,400
it's challenging um and uh i'm just

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
lucky i work at a company like github

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
where i get to the zoom call people

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
all day every day um which that doesn't

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
sound like a brag it sounds like a

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,400
anyway i'll move on but what i'm getting

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,000
on is like using the documentation and

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
finding like places like

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
if i if i spend a lot of time in the

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,600
actions documentation to be quite honest

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,440
and i also realize this is uh

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,600
this is the stage version look at that

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,760
there we go yeah so i spent a lot of

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,840
time here uh just looking for

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,840
specific stuff um honestly i haven't

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,679
even seen this quick start

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,960
oh we just redid the whole actions

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,960
landing page so

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,159
everything should be maybe a little bit

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
easier to find exactly what you're

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,280
looking for so that has been

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,760
a new new thing yeah

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,679
excellent yeah that what i was getting

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
at too as well i always know

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
kind of what i'm looking for and the one

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,000
thing i look for pretty quickly is

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,880
usually

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
um not managing oh this one which i'm

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,960
glad it's linked i

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
actually i used to just google from

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,120
google.com

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
uh events that trigger workflows because

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
i knew i could get to it eventually

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,480
but and here it is it would just show up

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
in the search results but yeah now i

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
know i can just click two clicks and i'm

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
in

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
uh but i look at this all the time so

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
when i'm building new actions

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,600
i just want to see what's available to

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,039
me uh shout out to workflowrun i just

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,480
learned about this one recently which

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
you can actually trigger workflows from

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,559
different files

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,360
uh directly in the repo um but yeah i've

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,000
just

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,520
kind of blown away on how easy it is to

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
learn things like actions how easy to

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,480
find all the the

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,440
information i need co-located in the

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
right place

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,440
um so yeah shout out to the past team uh

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
and we

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,400
we are humans so sometimes there are

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
typos or there are problems and if

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,279
you're on a page and you see a problem

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,480
like that if you scroll down

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,320
to the bottom we've got a button there

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
for you to make a contribution there's

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,480
actually two buttons

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,200
um this is a massive massive article uh

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,360
so

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
there's a there's a make a contribution

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,039
button um

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,120
there it is and if you click that you'll

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,760
get into the edited version

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,039
of this page on our doc site so you can

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,200
actually go into the repo and you can

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,159
make a change and open a pull request

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
and then i probably will be the person

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
who sees that ping

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,000
and comes in and says oh this is so

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
great thank you so much

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,159
let me triage this for the right team

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,600
and then the folks working on actions

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,880
who know way more about actions than i

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,080
do we'll look at it

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
and get it merged for you

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,159
you're gonna do it oh no you're one of

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,880
those people i'm making random

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,360
emoji nobody needs pizzas and action

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
docs

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
we'll we'll see if this gets pushed

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,240
through uh it looks like i can't commit

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,880
the main we'll need to get that

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,640
no no please don't commit to me on a

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,720
friday

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,919
this is a very important change i'll

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,600
back out of this change we don't we

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,279
don't actually need this change

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,880
that's okay but there you go you you

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,039
open your change and open a pull request

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,279
and then and then we have a conversation

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,120
and you can check it all out um please

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,520
please use the pull request template

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
we we have a template we have templates

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,440
please use them

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,440
they're there to make my life easier so

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
then i know what you intended with your

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
change

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,320
and where to send your change to people

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,760
who know what they're talking about

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
yeah and if folks didn't know that you

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,919
could actually set up a pull request

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,120
template by um creating a pull request

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
template file

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,720
and then it looks like it looks like

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,000
this so this is

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,720
this would be the context that you have

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
to fill out um

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
if you click raw there's actually a lot

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
of details in there explaining all the

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,360
pieces

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,480
so this is this is the secret so i've

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,640
got a bunch of

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,919
html commenting so it explains what you

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,799
need to do but then the only thing that

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,760
you'll see is

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,120
those those other pieces yeah excellent

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,880
yeah um

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,480
yeah the the markdown comments is

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
something i've taken a lot of advantage

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
of

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,080
um trying to in my project that i am

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,520
taking contributions on for

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
hacktoberfest i've been trying to push

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,799
people or

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,480
not push them to sort of like guide them

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,760
into some new features and github that

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,120
they might not be aware of

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,240
like linking issues to the pr's

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,440
by using the those tags um yep

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,799
so i i i finally figured out how to word

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,400
my comments in a way that this is

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,799
something to pay attention to

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
and actually please right fill in this

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
this part

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,880
as opposed to right like read over it um

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,320
i've been touring i know there's a

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
couple actions and a couple bots that

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,400
actually

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,080
validate the copy of your template

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,840
and then like we'll leave a comment if

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,039
the it's invalidated maybe someone

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,840
deleted something

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,279
um i feel like actually so dota2 who's

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
actually in the chat

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,400
i still have a pr open for you um no i

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,840
have a pr that you open for me

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,520
uh that i looked at this morning when i

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
got distracted but um i'll give you some

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,360
comments

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,360
uh this afternoon for sure

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,480
actually yes trying to think of what

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
other

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,640
so we spent a lot of time really

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,159
focusing on how to

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,720
make sure that anybody could drop in and

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,480
hopefully feel like they could

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
contribute i know that it can be really

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,600
i personally felt really intimidated the

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,880
first couple times i tried to contribute

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,640
to open source i was like oh my gosh

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320
what if i do everything wrong

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,399
and then they hate me and they don't

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,600
want to accept anything they don't even

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,600
read my pull request

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,159
so um yeah i just didn't a lot

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,720
and so please don't feel that way here

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,320
uh

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
someone even opened a poll request that

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,200
said i'm practicing

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,440
it's okay if you don't want this cool

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,399
great practice here it's okay like

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,159
please let me know that you're doing

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,480
that and not just a spammer because you

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,360
know

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,559
we get those right now too yeah no it's

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,960
um

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,640
i i don't mind people testing out the

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,240
tires and sometimes people test out you

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,000
know opening up issues and

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
uh leaving like one line changes or a

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
one-line request uh which is fine

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,399
like it's a it's a great way to say

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,000
hello um i will go ahead and close that

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,159
and like point you to the discord

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,159
like i have a discord um the chat with

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,919
people to keep them connected

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,159
and updated like what the plan is for

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,720
the project but speaking of discord

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,720
uh i see this discussion uh which is

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,960
github discussion so i'm curious

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
what do what do what i expect for for

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,919
this area and like what sort of content

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,799
is here

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
yeah so the idea with discussions for us

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
um

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,760
everyone uses discussions differently um

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,799
so we've got like a hello welcome here

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,880
and then

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,559
everything else you know if you have an

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,080
idea for how you think things should be

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,399
changed if you

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,080
have a feature request if you have a

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,880
question then feel free to open up a

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,000
discussion

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,600
where both the docs team and

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,360
the community can participate in the

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,320
answer and figuring it out and hashing

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,720
things through

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
um we had somebody open up a i think

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,880
that what does this notifications mean

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,600
here

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,960
so somebody went in they had a

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
conversation about it and then the end

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,240
result was oh you know what yeah

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,399
why don't you open an issue about that

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,399
and so then the person opened an issue

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,399
and and then we can get that fixed

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,440
yeah that's awesome yeah discussions are

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,120
a really good place to have that

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,799
conversation when you're not sure

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,320
whether or not something is an issue

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,360
we've been sort of thinking of issues as

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,520
a sort of a task list of the things that

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,720
should be done or could be done so

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,919
what's the um

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,080
i guess what would the boundary and i

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,960
guess since uh you're helping uh product

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
manage this as well

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,799
so what's the boundary from maybe

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,279
there's something not clear in the docs

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,240
like should i go to support first to ask

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,720
the question

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
so like actually github.com support and

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,440
say like i don't know if this works or

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,559
should i go directly to the docs to say

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,919
this is not documented

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,360
or yeah so um

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,880
if it's something about your account

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
personally definitely go to support

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,039
because we have no

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,159
access to anything of yours um but if

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,000
it's like

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,080
i don't understand what this line is

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,240
supposed to mean or am i interpreting

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
this correctly or i think this might not

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,039
quite be right then feel free to come

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,360
open an issue

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,480
the answer might be yeah it is

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,480
documented right

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,760
and here's some more explanation about

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,840
it do you have a question like we can

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,840
chat about it

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,440
um but yeah probably an issue

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
or a discussion feel free to do a

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,159
discussion

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,600
excellent yeah and i just wanted to

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,279
point out with discussions you can get

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,880
your questions answered

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,480
uh so if you do have a question you can

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,399
see um

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,200
object um he asked a question we have an

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,080
answer

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,399
um so it looks like felicity i'm not

00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
sure

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,440
content writer github i've actually not

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,679
met felicity before

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
um actually i think i know who this is

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,799
great yes i've definitely seen them

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
around but i've never actually had

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,120
interactions with them

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,120
yeah uh the best like my favorite thing

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,880
about discussions as a medium for

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,559
questions is that those questions still

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
exist so if you have a question

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,240
i almost guarantee that someone else has

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,919
the same one so if you put it in a

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,519
discussion and we find an answer we can

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
mark it as an answer and then if someone

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,120
else

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,559
comes in looking for the same

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,240
information there's a spot to go

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,399
so i do have a question and it's

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
something i've wanted to ask the actions

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,480
team slash the docs team

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,919
and it's something i've always wanted so

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,200
okay maybe i'll this will turn into a

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,120
discussion eventually

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
but my question just being a heavy

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
actions user

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,080
is the github token that you get

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,399
provided i just want to know what the

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,600
the ceiling is for those for that github

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
token i'm not sure if that's actually

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,159
documented

00:31:50,799 --> 00:32:00,240
anywhere within the actions and i have

00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,039
literally no idea let's find out you go

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,519
permissions

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,559
for okay i think this is exactly what i

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,519
wanted

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,039
so this is this did not exist back like

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,720
probably six months ago when i start

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,760
really started turning up the the heat

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,640
for actions

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,600
but just simply knowing what can i do

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,399
with the token

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,159
is actually what i wanted so um hats off

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,600
to me for never searching this

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,440
and then finally seeing what i what i

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,919
wanted so

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,039
i mean people think of docs as being

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,279
sort of a static

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,880
thing for the most part and they're not

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,799
we've got i think

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,600
15 writers going at it all the time

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,880
they are constantly writing updating

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,760
changing the docs

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
and that's something that's not

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
necessarily visible to everyone with how

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,480
big

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,159
our documentation library is like you

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,159
can't tell that this one article

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,200
was updated unless you happen to go back

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,519
to it um

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,279
so having the repo open source like

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,840
gives you a little bit more insight into

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,440
that

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,799
um and then there will be cheat like

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
we're looking to make some changes so

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080
that everything is a little bit more

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
interactive and maybe there's some

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,000
some wiggle room there and figuring out

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,960
how that all looks

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,159
yeah excellent yeah i'll be uh so i

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,279
bring this up because i've been doing

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,960
some um

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,320
some training actually i have a training

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,799
next week for actions

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,120
and i've been wanting this but i didn't

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,399
want to go through and try to

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,600
well i do have access to look at the

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,120
code but like it's going to take me way

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
more time than just asking

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,640
um yeah but like having a chart like

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,399
this is exactly what i needed

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,679
um to be able to say this is the

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,840
limitation or

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,519
the extent of what you can do which is

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,320
all i needed um which i'm

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,360
happy this this is so serendipitous i

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,559
had you on the

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,080
rubber duck dust with me yeah because i

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,440
don't know what that is at all excellent

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,760
well we'll have to we'll have to get you

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,279
some

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,160
github actions training we'll get you

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,279
writing actions in the repo pretty soon

00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,120
[Music]

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,320
i wanted to transition real quick um

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
because you had mentioned this in your

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,559
intro

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,080
and i wanted to give some space for

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,919
outreachy um

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,200
yes so do you want to explain what

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,279
outreach is and how you were involved

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,559
yeah so um there are a lot of programs

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,799
that are really big

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,399
like google summer of code and some

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,320
other things where

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,599
folks can come in and spend like three

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,240
months working with an open source

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,000
project and get paid for it um but

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,079
outreachy is different because

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,040
they work with folks who are not

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
students

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,560
and that's not really a common thing uh

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,480
there are lots of folks who are looking

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,760
to transition into tech and there aren't

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
as many opportunities

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,679
and outreachy creates that opportunity

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,879
for people from marginalized groups

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,280
um they're global uh they take

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,079
global the ba ba they accept

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,119
applications

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,599
globally words are hard uh

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,159
and so i worked for an or i worked with

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,240
an

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,359
organization called sisters which is uh

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,520
the community

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,119
portion of the anita b org foundation

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,320
that puts on grace hopper every year

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,879
okay um and so there's they put up

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,839
a bunch of projects i think they might

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,079
have changed it

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,680
a little bit but basically you put in

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,359
open source contributions and you

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,280
end up working for an organization that

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,800
has applied and been accepted to

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,200
participate in outreachy

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,040
and you get paid actual money so that

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,359
you can afford to

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,839
do this internship which was a big thing

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,200
for me

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,880
um and it was it was a really cool

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,720
experience it got me a lot more

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,320
comfortable with github it got me a lot

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,000
more comfortable with asking questions

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,680
publicly which is a big part of open

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,720
source but can be really intimidating at

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,960
the beginning

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
um and it really sort of led the way

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,040
into

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,400
working with gulp and then working in

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,000
github

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,680
cool and you mentioned that in

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,560
transition too as well you so you worked

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,000
with

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,200
gulp specifically in documentation i did

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and so i uh

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,480
if you click that get started at the top

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
um

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,320
we rewrote all of the documentation put

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,800
it on the site for

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,599
the version for version four of gulp and

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,040
so

00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,920
uh the lead maintainer and i

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,160
wrote all these docs to get everybody

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,320
started working on gulp

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,760
that is that is awesome what a what a

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
nice introduction to

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,960
to github but also to even open source

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,400
too as well and like

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
kind of full circle for you because now

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,640
you're you're doing open source at

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,079
github

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,480
which is pretty amazing yeah yeah it's

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,560
been

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,760
it's been quite the long and twisted

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,800
journey and took

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
multiple years of um sort of flitting in

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
and out of tech and not being sure that

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
it was really the right place for me

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,680
um i started learning how to code and

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,320
realized i don't

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,880
like it and didn't want to do it it's

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,960
just not

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,880
my thing um and i didn't actually know

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
that technical writing was a job

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,359
i would not call myself a writer i don't

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
like write stories or anything like that

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,240
and so

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,320
the idea that someone was going to pay

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,880
me money to explain

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,640
how to do something was right up my

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
alley

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,160
and sort of trying to learn to program

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,000
help me understand

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
enough background knowledge and base

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,839
level understanding of

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
programming that i can sort of read into

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,040
what things are and understand how to

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,160
even start researching something

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,480
to document it yeah

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,839
it's so i spent the the last couple days

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
actually chatting with a lot of new open

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,079
source contributors as well as people

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,760
who

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
uh broke into open source and like just

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,040
in the the context of like hacktoberfest

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,839
i've been a part of a bunch of different

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,839
events

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,520
and just encouraging folks to get

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,440
involved and like

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,520
hearing that you you found your way even

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,960
like after uh uh i guess attempting or

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,280
maybe you did learn how to code

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
um yeah i don't know what the yeah okay

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,680
so a little bit

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,000
umpu though um uh learning a little bit

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,240
of

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
how to write code finding out that it

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,760
wasn't for you

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,880
and that you wanted to do something else

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,560
in tech and like

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,440
being able to use your skill set uh in

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
different ways and i think that's

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,320
something that

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,680
a lot of folks don't don't realize that

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,200
there's a lot of opportunity to bring

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,079
your skill set that's outside of

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,040
programming

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
like you happen to be a teacher prior um

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,520
which has helped you

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,400
and being empathetic for is empathetic

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,960
pathetic

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,599
sounds that sounds like the wrong word

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,280
um

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,680
but yeah they have the empathy to

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,599
understand the onboarding experience and

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,599
um how did you get connected with the

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,280
gulp.js was that through outreachy

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,160
specifically directly

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
no it wasn't um so my husband is a

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,960
javascript developer

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,760
and so uh what happened was that i was

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
i suddenly realized that he was getting

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,240
paid to do

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,000
way cooler stuff than i was and getting

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,359
more money than i was as a teacher and i

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
was like i'm gonna totally learn how to

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,440
do this so i started using

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,400
all of these free resources you know

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
free code camp

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,560
and i was doing some code academy stuff

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,119
and some of the

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,640
harvard mit classes and just sort of

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
grabbing on to anything that i could to

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,839
figure out what was interesting and what

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,839
i might like to do and he is

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,040
friends with one of the maintainers of

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,560
gulp so i

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,320
ended up starting just helping write

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,240
blog posts um

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,400
i didn't understand what i was reading

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,800
at all he would write this blog post

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,839
about very technical things i didn't

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,320
know what it was but

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,000
i had just enough knowledge that i could

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
sort of edit it over and say like well

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,119
what are you trying to say here what's

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,920
your purpose who's your audience what's

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,720
the goal

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,160
and we could work together to create a

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,200
blog post that was

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,560
um accessible and usable

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,280
and focused on on who needed it

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,960
that's awesome yeah i mean again so much

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,920
serendipity in your story and how you

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,960
sort of found yourself

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,320
into doing that and then i'm curious

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,040
since we're on that this path like

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,480
specifically

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,280
how did you get into github

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,520
so um i decided so i actually took the

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,040
years that i was doing outreachy and

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,760
um uh and working with gulp

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,040
i was i had very small children so i

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,880
have a

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
four and seven year old their birthdays

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,920
are almost and

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,599
just happened so i kind of forget how

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,720
old they are right now um

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,400
and so i took some time off to

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,160
be at home with kids and i was doing a

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
lot of part-time stuff

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,760
and then i decided that i was i was

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,079
ready to get back to

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,720
having some sort of full-time

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,680
conversation with adults and not small

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,440
children

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,640
so i started applying at random places i

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,640
loved um like i knew github i'd met

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,680
people at conferences from github

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,319
i really really loved all the people

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,720
that i'd met

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,480
and so i started just kind of creeping

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,760
keeping an eye and then a position

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,200
happened to open up

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,359
um on the core content team writing

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,000
just all of the things um the core

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,480
content team writes

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
anything that shows up and isn't apis

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,640
packages

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,160
actions or advanced security

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
and so every day i would sit down and

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
write something different and i never

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,480
knew

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,200
what i was going to be writing about and

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,800
i probably didn't understand it before i

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,400
pulled an issue that i had to write some

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,400
documentation and had to learn about it

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,119
and figure it out and go from there

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,319
yeah that's awesome and i guess my next

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,920
question is like have you

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,520
rediscovered your love for coding after

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,880
you know you've wrote about coding for

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,079
so long

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,200
no um

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,440
i was really into uh i really

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,359
enjoyed doing some like front end work

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
um that's the small amount of work that

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,640
i was really doing

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,720
um i made a really really ugly website

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,200
for sisters which hopefully no one ever

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,240
finds

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,760
um it's hideous so i

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,760
enjoy writing like css and html and

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,720
that's about as far as i got and then

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,160
and then i bounced and started writing

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,760
words instead but i really like

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,240
collaborating with people and technical

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
writing

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,480
lets you work with all these people who

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,280
have expertise but don't necessarily

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
know how to

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,000
transfer that into documentation

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,160
just like in education you can have

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,160
these brilliant teachers who are

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,640
so smart and so understand what they're

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,079
talking about but they don't necessarily

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,599
know how to take 17 steps back from

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,720
their advanced knowledge and write

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,119
beginner documentation yeah

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,400
no that is that is true and like uh the

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,560
your interactions with the

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,319
the gulp maintainer too as well is a lot

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,920
of a lot of what i like about the

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,440
the content writers even the copy

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,760
editors to github

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,760
is that sometimes i i i think i know

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
what i'm doing but sometimes a structure

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,400
or just have the call to action that's

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,440
very clear

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,240
um yeah i'm a big fan of like people

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,119
teaching me

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,240
on how to do this better and um yeah uh

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,400
a hero too late

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,599
um said that the quote the documentation

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,079
is the love letter that you write to

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,119
your future

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,200
self um which is like

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,480
yeah like my readmes like my

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,079
contributing guides

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,760
it's stuff like where i'm just like i

00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,839
haven't done this

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,359
a while actually i was just contributing

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,520
to um

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,640
um to node.js actually and i was finding

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,480
that um

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,599
there was a there was something

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,119
different like to go in the really in

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,240
the weeds like there's a runtime called

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,440
v8 and we had to

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,880
backport it um which is like not

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,680
important details but the the fact that

00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,680
the back porting

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,960
and getting the get history to match

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,400
with like what was

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,000
up on github.com um

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,440
there was no it wasn't documented it was

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,160
kind of like a weird edge case that no

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,319
one

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,400
no one like only a handful of people

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,760
even do this and i happen to

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,680
not that i do it all the time it just

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,280
happened to be the problem i was trying

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,960
to solve required me to do this

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,200
so i kind of just hit edge case where

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,599
it's like no one's gonna ever run into

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
this

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,800
but then when someone runs into it and

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,079
they figure it out or they don't figure

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,760
it out then there's like i don't know

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,359
what's going on so maybe i'll just walk

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,119
away from this forever

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,640
and it would have been a shame if i did

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,920
because it was it was actually pretty

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,839
trivial to fix

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,359
uh it just happened to be like one of

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,560
those it works on my machine

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,200
problems and uh yeah i just needed

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,599
needed a helpful extra pair eyes to help

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,599
fix that

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,920
yeah that collaboration piece is is

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
definitely my favorite that's what made

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,920
um the idea of transit transitioning

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,319
into product management appealing to me

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,760
like

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,720
the more people i can talk to about all

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,920
the things that they're good at and

00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,560
figure out how to make them all fit

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,839
together

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,480
like the happier i am so uh it was a

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,079
logical transition

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,760
yeah so moving to speaking of

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,960
transitioning moving back at o1

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,640
pollux uh welcome welcome in

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,160
thanks for the the love and the hearts

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
as well um

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,520
talking about the github documentation

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,839
and being open sourced last week

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,599
and ways people can contribute um we

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,200
just got we finished talking about this

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,480
uh github discussions being a place that

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
we can actually

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,240
um ask questions things that may be

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,440
missing within the documentation it's a

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,520
good place to start

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,880
um get up discussions it's a newer

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,440
feature that was shipped earlier this

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,920
year

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,720
um that focus on well literally just

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,480
discussing

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,880
the project um so leverage that um

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,240
also the fact that we have this now new

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,119
make a contribution button

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,839
at the bottom of all the articles um it

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,359
actually opens up

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,839
somewhere like what we see like we see

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,960
this in a lot of different documentation

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,160
platforms and tools and guides uh you

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,760
can actually make the edit

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,400
uh i love that it's actually a legit

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,400
button too as well can't miss that

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,000
well you have to scroll down to find it

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,640
but yeah you do

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
sure and not only we didn't actually

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,960
even jump into the contributing guide

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,640
either

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,640
yeah so um we are excited about

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,760
whatever kind of contribution you're

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,079
ready to make so

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,000
if it's opening an issue awesome thank

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,599
you so much and if it's opening a pull

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,040
request then that's great

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,640
um and if it's asking a question then

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,119
that's that's a great way to contribute

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,520
to

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,520
um contributions are not just pull

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,160
requests though we appreciate those as

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,160
well

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,359
um our contributing guide also explains

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,599
a couple things that we're not

00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,160
accepting uh contributions on right now

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,760
like localization and translated content

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,480
um and then we are struggling to

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,720
uh take images so if you have a

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,079
screenshot that you see that is outdated

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,160
please open an issue

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,200
um but it can get really complex with

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,400
our versioning so

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,040
our doc site is versioned for github

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
server

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,400
and all the different versions of github

00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,119
server that we currently support as well

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,040
as

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,359
all of the rest of the end users so

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,400
those images can get wonky

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,880
okay yeah yeah best to uh leave it to

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,319
the uh

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,160
the folks who can figure that out when

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,760
they're in yeah

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,200
but that issue is appreciated because we

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
may not notice that it's outdated

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,520
sometimes we miss

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,119
those yeah excellent and i'm curious um

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,880
so i did see the the call out to github

00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,079
desktop i think so over here yeah you

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,520
can actually

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,040
fork using github desktop i love desktop

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,000
desktop is my best friend yeah i i use

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,839
it for

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,839
one-offs so for a longest time i always

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,760
use desktop for my second account

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,920
uh i keep a second account for testing

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,200
purposes and in order to contribute i

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,000
don't want to use like the

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,359
in get you can do profiles but it just

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
becomes

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,319
actually i probably set up pretty easily

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,079
if i just took the time but what i'm

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,640
getting at is like i don't

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,680
it's easier to download desktop also i

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,440
like using

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,280
a lot of different things so desktop

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,400
having an excuse to use it

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,680
because i spent a lot of time on the

00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,280
command line um that's what i use yeah

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,640
yeah we had a really great intern in the

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,599
summer we had our first ever

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,880
documentation

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,880
intern uh and yeah he got to

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,000
redo this a bunch of the desktop

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
documentation which

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
he restructured and worked through it

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,880
updated some screenshots and just like

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,839
made it all beautiful um when i first

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,520
started at github

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,200
uh git was really scary for me

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,880
i'm not gonna lie zeke would back me up

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,000
here um i'm still afraid of get

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,800
it terrifies me um i feel like it's very

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,720
opaque

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,559
and so i'm always afraid that i did

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,160
something um

00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,000
that i'm not gonna understand how to get

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,000
myself out of and desktop

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,760
is really helpful in that area because

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,559
you can see what you're doing

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,200
and uh it can help i don't know it's

00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,599
really helpful

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,040
there's also uh one thing i've heard a

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,880
lot of people really enjoy is that you

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,800
can easily add co-committers

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,079
so if you work with somebody else

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,280
there's a little spot in desktop where

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,760
you just throw their handle at it and

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,680
it'll

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,440
it'll populate it for you and they'll be

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,720
added to your commit

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,880
instead of having to try to remember the

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,400
syntax nice

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,400
uh do people call you jan ice

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,920

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,200
come on uh

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,200
he he misread the name and thought it

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,599
was jan ice the whole time you never

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,599

even if you're not sure where your

00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,920

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,960

testing things

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,640
excellent yeah now there's like lots of

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,079
jokes about

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,520
your neighbors and throwing rocks the um

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,000
so we do have a little bit of time i

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,839
actually wanted to ask you a question of

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,119
what yeah like you've been around like

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,880
seeing a lot of different projects like

00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,400
what are some uh

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,720
real birds jealous uh what are the

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,319
some of the the projects that you you're

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,480
impressed with that are hosted on github

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,280
and open sourced

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,280
oh i

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,599
so gatsby is one of my

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,319
absolute favorite open source projects

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,240
to look at

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,760
and see how how well they're caring for

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,359
brand new contributors

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,800
um netlify i creeped on netlify a lot

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,160
too

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,440
like any documentation so i write docs

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,880
any documentation that focuses on brand

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,559
new users that don't

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,000
necessarily understand all the

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,040
background information

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,960
is my jam um

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,720
it's just that it's that missing piece

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,839
like when i very first started

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,520
i don't know what i was reading but i

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,800
was reading some sort of guide and it

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,079
was like open the terminal

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,359
and i was like i don't know what that

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,200
means you can't google

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,480
how to open the terminal all sorts of

00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,079
random stuff pops up

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,680
it doesn't actually work i didn't

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,599
understand what was happening and like

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,079
nobody would just explain that piece to

00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,079
me

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,680
um so anyone that takes the time and the

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,599
care to really really

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,880
get down and dirty explaining the basics

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,640
is

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,640
is my friend it's my favorite

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,440
excellent i just dropped in the chat uh

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,000
so last week we had a chat with

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,920
documentation as well

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,440
so if you want to learn about how they

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,119
do documentation

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,640
and how they structure their

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,200
contributions as well

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,200

notifications uh feel free to sign up

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,480
for the group and we're just sort of

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,400
funneling all messaging and

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,240
notifications there so

00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,079
check it out i'll drop a link in the uh

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,480
the chat too as well if you

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,440
came later and you missed my earlier

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,000
link dump

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,359
so cool awesome thank you so much this

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,760
was super fun

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,440
yeah it's fun it's always nice to uh

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,920
share the experience of how open source

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,599
works

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,440
i know this is open source project

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,720
that's built on github but like we are

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,800
using the same patterns with the

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,200
contributing md and the guides and

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,319
issue templates so i think if we were

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,440
looking for a model

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,160
for how to structure your open source

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,559
project or

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,400
gain contributors um there it is

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,520
and everybody else hit the follow button

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,800
too as well i should say that you hit

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,240
the follow button on this twitch right

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,359
now so that way you get notifications

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,880
and you can just forget about the meetup

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,839
page you just be surprised

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,640
whenever we go live like christmas

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,079
morning every friday

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,440
all right with that being said i'm gonna

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:49,520
move on and uh yeah thanks again janice

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:49,520
