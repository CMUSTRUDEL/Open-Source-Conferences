Title: docs.github.com - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2020-10-19
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	We open sourced GitHub’s product documentation to help demonstrate that it’s possible (and beneficial) for private companies to open source their products. GitHub has open sourced hundreds of projects over the years, but docs.github.com is the first private production service that we’ve migrated into the open. We hope that our application design, automation workflows, and openness to external contributions can be a model for other organizations that want to open up their private projects and benefit from community collaboration.
