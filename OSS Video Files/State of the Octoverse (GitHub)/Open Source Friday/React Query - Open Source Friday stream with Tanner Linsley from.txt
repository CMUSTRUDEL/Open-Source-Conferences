Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 23rd October 2020, 2pm AEDT. We interviewed Tanner Linsley from React Query, an open source hook for fetching, caching, and updating data. We had the chance to deep dive into Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Tanner gave us some top tips of building a product from scratch, giving yourself a challenge, and some of the cool GitHub features to enable to ensure success of your open source project.

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,880
on board for our open source friday

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,520
stream so

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,680
how have you been going with react query

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,439
what's been happening on that front and

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,439
maybe for all those viewers who don't

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,799
know before we jump into all the ins and

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,920
outs of getting involved in the open

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
source community

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
how about we have a little chat first

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
about what react crew is those people

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,399
who have absolutely no idea

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,040
sure uh so react query is going great

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,560
um react query is a library that i

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
launched about a year ago in fact i

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,479
think it it just turned one year old

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,079
about party time yeah like a week ago

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,960
party during yeah and it's been going

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,479
awesome

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,680
so it has like 14 000 stars and

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
almost 200 contributors now um but react

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,920
query is a library

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,879
uh for fetching data in react simply put

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,280
i've been told by a lot of people that

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,959
it's kind of like the missing

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,640
data fetching library for react but

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,720
it does a lot more than that but that's

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,800
a good place to start

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
i like it now if we go and jump over and

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,879
have a look at your github profile you

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
definitely

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,239
weren't telling lies because you look up

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,920
the top there 14.3

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,040
000 stars well done on that so that is

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,239
amazing and if we

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,879
scroll down here look at number

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,200
contributors 190 contributors

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
and used by over two and a half thousand

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,920
people so

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,920
very very awesome and great work on that

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
now you talk a little bit about like

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,599
route query

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,360
and like what it actually is and you

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,120
only started a year ago

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,920
so that was pretty cool and to have like

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,000
your one-year anniversary of birthday

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,360
this time is really really awesome so

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,080
why did you start react query

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,599
react query you know i didn't just wake

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,959
up one day and say i'm going to build

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,319
react query um

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,400
but it it's been a long time coming

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,959
honestly i would say ever since i

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
migrated to react from angular like

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,879
four years ago um i

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
i just i've always wanted something like

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,120
react query

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,720
in react and uh you know my entire

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,720
journey of going through the react

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,879
ecosystem and getting into open source

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,080
has kind of led up to

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,000
react query itself getting really deep

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,760
into redux

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
building kind of redux wrappers that

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
maybe weren't super popular at the time

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
and now they are

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,720
um you know building other libraries

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
that

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
that maybe aren't as popular but helped

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,439
me practice my open source foo

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
like react to table but at the end of

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
the day

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,439
like a lot of things led up to react

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,840
query um react hooks was a huge one

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,519
um anybody who has used react query

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
knows that it's hooks only

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,239
so that's that's kind of fun um

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,560
but yeah like every every

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,079
thing about fetching data in react just

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
never felt right until

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
i built react query so a lot of those

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
pieces came together over the years

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
until everything kind of just

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,160
aligned perfectly to release the library

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
nice and if we jump across again have a

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,880
quick look at your

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,560
website yeah all the things you're

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,040
saying you know react hooks and things

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
like that

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
now i'm curious this tan stack

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
newsletter is up because of tanner is

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,240
that why it's called tan stuck

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,400
yeah and you know that started out as a

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,520
joke um from one of my friends on

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,040
twitter and you know he he's like oh

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
it's so funny you should call it the tan

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
stack and i kind of chuckled at first

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,919
like oh

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
that would be interesting and he kept

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,680
saying it over and over on twitter

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
and even made a hashtag for it and other

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
people started jumping on board and i

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,759
was like

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
okay you know it kind of doesn't sound

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,080
half bad now so let's do it

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
here we go so you can actually subscribe

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,759
to the

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
future home of 10 stack um

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,960
i think it's yeah i've got every time i

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
read this i'm like jam stack

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
or tan stack like what other kind of

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
snack is it

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
i quite like it so uh yeah as you

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,360
mentioned

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,199
you had a brief chat to me before you

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,759
jumped on this so you even have a

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
discord server 410 stack

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,080
um and that's what you're going to be um

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
i suppose that's where a lot of your

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,520
community live right

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,400
yep there's almost 1500 of us there and

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
honestly it's a super tight-knit and

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,080
very

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
inviting community of people who just

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,759
want to build

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,039
better applications and they they find

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
my tools useful

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,039
and everybody kind of can kind of

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,000
converges there to help each other out

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
so

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
um we've had a chat to a few of the

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
other maintainers on open source friday

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
nights a lot of them seem to have

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,479
discord servers which i think is an

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,199
amazing thing right you know when you

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
talk about

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,039
trying to find communities a lot of um

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
maintainers and contributors say a great

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,600
way to find

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
communities through discord servers so

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
what are the types of things that you do

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,680
over on your serving you talked about

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
people like

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
supporting one another but what other

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,319
kind of conversations that go on

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
like what are the kind of things

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,440
happening there's any cool like examples

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
of like

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
i don't know really cool clubs or

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
something that's that's come out of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,319
having your discord server and having a

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
community on that

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,000
yeah absolutely there's um

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,960
there's a huge range of conversations

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that go on

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,840
on that server uh everywhere from

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
people who just got into react and

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,160
they're just kind of learning the basics

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
and they're looking for help

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
all the way to like very in-depth uh

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,000
discussions about

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
the internals of the libraries that i

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,759
write

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
i even have private channels there for

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,840
all of the contributors

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
of all my libraries so that they can

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,759
plan together

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,960
and discuss internals and ideas without

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,560
you know causing

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,759
uh causing a riot in the normal channels

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
um there's a channel for each library

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,160
there

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
so that people can discuss specific

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,319
issues and

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
um yeah like it's really just kind of

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,639
all over the place

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,800
um another fun one too is uh

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,479
we have some new stuff coming out for

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,680
react query next year

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,400
that um yeah we're kind of

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,919
it's it's not really a secret but you

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,800
know we're keeping it kind of down low

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
for now but

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,080
it's uh we're trying to make react query

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
platform

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
agnostic so you could use it with any

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,400
other uh framework

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,800
angular spell whatever you want and i

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
have

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
met some of the coolest contributors who

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,919
are so passionate about these projects

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
and react query that they are helping me

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,879
write

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
uh these new bindings for it and they

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,000
all have their own channels

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,440
to kind of work together and anybody can

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
become a contributor and

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
i put you into the channel and you can

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
help contribute to these new libraries

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,560
it's very cool just to see the amount of

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
collaboration that happens

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,479
uh inside of there yeah that's really

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
cool and i'm i'm really interested in

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
these just because

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
i'm in the i'm a gamer so we obviously

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,000
have a lot of discord servers for gaming

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,919
as well and i think um the more and more

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
i chat to maintainers the more i find

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,199
that they're all using these servers for

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
these kind of things i want to give a

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,479
shout out to ice cream tango on the chat

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
thank you so much for being here

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,520
um shout out to everyone else in the

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
chat as well don't forget that we are

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
taking questions from the chat so if

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,440
there's something you want to know

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,479
about open source about react query

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,719
specifically

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,599
about anything just pop it in the chat

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,440
and um i'd be more than happy to ask

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
now i do want to keep on this discord

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,560
server thing for a little bit longer

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,399
um we've had some questions in previous

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
weeks but also people have seen me quite

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
interested

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,959
in how you actually build that community

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
on discord so you said you have what

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,360
1500 people on discord so how do you go

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,839
about building up that community

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
and building a cadence around getting on

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,160
the discord server

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,200
interacting with one another and yeah

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
how do you go about that yeah

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
i didn't find it too challenging to be

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
honest the first thing i did was just

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
create the server

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
and give it some good branding you know

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
make sure that the logo is on there and

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,760
that it feels legit

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,880
and then i just took that uh i made an

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839
invite

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
uh and put that invite link on all of my

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
repos

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,279
uh every everywhere i have it um i made

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,440
that landing page for my

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
uh for the 10 stack and i put that link

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
there too

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
basically anywhere that i have that's

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
public i said i just made sure that

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,000
people can

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
you know go here if you want to be a

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
part of the community you know

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
and in the beginning i had to be the

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,519
community

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
myself i had to be very very involved

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
with

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
uh discussing every single question and

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,440
every single topic

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
so it is very involved in the beginning

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,839
um if you want to kind of jump start it

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,360
and as more people join and the

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,560
conversations uh start to flow better

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,760
and also as um certain people

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,519
start to come out as kind of um

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
kind of ringleaders inside of the

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
community you know people who

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,680
are moderating for you and answering

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,480
questions on your behalf and

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
you know kind of the cheerleaders of of

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,040
the

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
project itself those people start to

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,279
emerge and they make

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,920
um they make it easier than to kind of

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,440
step back a little bit and just kind of

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
you know lead people and manage there

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
and

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,279
not have to be uber involved and just

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
kind of jump in

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,040
um you know when there needs to be

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
either moderation or when you need to

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
announce something new

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
so you kind of like kickstart the

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
community and then the community gets

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
big enough they can cut

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,200
run itself i suppose like any other

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
community i think um

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,399
the the big question we've been having

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
though is how do you actually jump start

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
that and i think you've answered it

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
perfectly you know just basically

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
everywhere where your community

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
currently is just go put your discord on

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
everything

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
so if we have a quick brief look at a

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
couple of your websites you've got

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,040
you know join the discord here there's

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
probably somewhere here as well on the

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,200
home page like

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
join discord um and do you have it let's

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
have a look

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,839
as it on the repo as well it's probably

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
in the redmi file right

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,600
i think there is like a discord badge

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
somewhere

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
there's a lot of things usually up here

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,200
i usually know as a discord budget

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,000
somewhere at the top here or

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
also inside of the issue templates in

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
github

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,120
um i believe if you go to create a new

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,839
issue

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,600
you're going to see a template that says

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,839
you know what do you what do you want

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,680
is it a feature request is a community

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,240
chat so that feature requests and

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,360
questions

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,079
that will take you to the discussions uh

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
section of the repo that's awesome so

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,000
you've got discussions and now which is

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,040
good

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,560
we can talk about this next yeah and

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,839
uh yep put a pin in that one and uh

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
the other one the other link will

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,800
actually take you to the discord server

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
itself so

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,480
if you click on the hence what it says

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,079
so you've set these up this is perfect

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
there you go go straight to discord and

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,800
then you can join the discord server

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,800
there you go that is really really cool

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
now i've got a question from the chat

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
and then we're going to come back to

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,760
um the discussions because i love

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
talking about discussions and definitely

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,480
get some of your thoughts on it

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
i'm going to question the chat saying

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,800
that um if you are new to open source

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,399
um how do you go about actually

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
starting to promote the libraries you're

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,440
developing without like an existing

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,519
presence we've had

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,279
but um i want to hear your thoughts now

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
i'll give you some thoughts about um

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,639
what our

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
um guest last week spoke about from

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
hopscotch he had some very

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
interesting insights on how to go about

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
promoting yourself but how do

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
for you tana what are your thoughts on

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,360
how do you get out there promote

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,760
yourself without having an existing

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,000
community already

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,839
that's a tough question but i think the

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,360
way that i have approached that

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,560
is it doesn't matter in the beginning

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,200
it doesn't matter how much marketing you

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,120
do

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
or how much presence you have for a

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,519
library

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,560
to some extent unless the library is

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,240
actually good

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,440
so uh i think at the bare minimum you

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
need to make sure that

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
you have a library that works that has

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,600
documentation

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,279
um and is actually solving a problem

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,880
either in a way that is different or

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
better than the tools that you're trying

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,800
to compete against

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,160
uh you know having an open source

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
library isn't

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,560
it's not about having the library it's

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,639
about solving a problem

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
and knowing your problem space

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,720
like the back of your hand is going to

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,360
help you navigate

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,120
that environment and the better that you

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
can know that problem space and know

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
your competitors

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,639
um the better you're going to be able to

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
market your library

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,320
so the way that i started was just

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,560
finding the problem space

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,160
that wasn't being addressed by the

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
existing tools

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
in the in the ecosystem i built a

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,839
library

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,360
that was geared towards that specific

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
problem solving it in the way that i

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
thought was best

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
and from there i mean it does help to

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
have

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,240
an existing presence on the internet but

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,279
you don't need a presence to

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,720
go to stack overflow questions

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,800
or to get on reddit or you know

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,800
really to go to the

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,639
community portions of the internet and

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,959
just kind of put yourself out there

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,720
you just have to say hey you know here's

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,720
a library i made and if you're having

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,760
this type of an issue it will probably

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,920
help you

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,800
and also making yourself personally

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
available

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,480
in the beginning just like the discord

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,880
server you have to be

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
there for the very first users of your

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,120
library

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,839
um making yourself available and

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,440
putting in the time and the labor that

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
it's going to take to get the

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
proper feedback to make your library

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,240
better

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,399
definitely i think um so we had lyrics

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,560
from hopscotch on last week

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,560
and he was saying very very similar

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,560
things um to you which is

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,160
you know find where your audience is go

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,959
and promote he was saying to like don't

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,880
like shamelessly self-promote everywhere

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
you know jump on places like you know

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,079
start building your twitter following

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
jump on discord servers

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
um you know start like get on the reddit

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
sub um

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
subreddits and things like that um and

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,880
if you do want to read a little bit

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,639
about that from last week here is on the

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
dev two posts i've put together and one

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
of the things he says is

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
um you know just basically just get out

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
there and write like you need to find

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,839
your audience

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,360
and find out where they are now um

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,959
before we jump into discussions had a

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
couple of questions about github dark

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
mode which i get quite a lot on this

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
stream

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,800
um light mode does burn my eyes too but

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,199
if you want dark mode

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,279
um we don't have an official github dark

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,199
mode

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,880
for anyone out there at the moment but

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,519
what we do have

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,639
again another amazing um open source

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,920
project

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,800
is what you call dark reader so

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
dark reader um allows you to make your

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
browser

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,160
dark and it'll it goes across everything

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
so obviously this is why you see my

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
github in a dark mode if i go to any

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
other

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,240
um website as well this is probably why

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,560
yours looks a bit

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,519
funky because uh we've got dark reader

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,279
on um

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,199
so i'm gonna turn it off it goes white

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,199
now turn back on it goes

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
dark again i'm a dark reader again

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,920
another open source project um but we

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
have been getting a lot of feedback

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,120
about dark mode for github so

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,399
you never know um and if you ever do

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
want to know about

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,600
um what's happening with github you can

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
always go check out our

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,680
public roadmap um so we released the

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,199
public roadmap

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,680
um only like a couple months

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
not like literally not that long ago um

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,160
and you can go jump on our public

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,720
roadmap and see all the things that are

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,199
coming up

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
so um go check that out but our

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,519
discussions

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,839
um tana wouldn't chat about this how are

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,280
you finding discussions and what are you

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,319
actually you kind of touched on a little

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
bit before but

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,400
um so for those of you who don't know we

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,919
launched um github discussions

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,039
at satellite this year back in may which

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,039
is being that long

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,039
um and it's a way for people to have

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,280
good discussions are within

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
their repo so i want to hear from you

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
with how you are finding discussions

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,199
but also what are the kinds of things

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,799
you're using discussions for within the

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,799
query repo so i was lucky enough to

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,160
be one of the earliest beta testers of

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,039
discussions on

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
react table and i got to add it to react

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,440
query

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
very quickly after that and i was able

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
to

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,320
give a lot of hopefully good feedback to

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,520
the team on how to make it better

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,720
it has been a massive game changer for

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,280
issue triaging personally i

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,120
i really do not like github issues for

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,600
anything other than issues

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
and if if you kind of take an issue

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,520
coming in

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,679
on your library and say you know where

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,760
does this issue need to go

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
this was kind of a missing piece because

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,640
if it was like a really quick

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,880
question or like a question that maybe

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,320
was asking for something like the

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,240
community help

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
that's something where now discord can

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,480
fill that gap

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,280
um if it was a real issue then it makes

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
sense to

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
be have it be in the issues right and

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,320
and tag it up and try and fix it

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,400
but there are so many of uh there's so

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
many issues that used to come in

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
and still do to some extent that are

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,679
just kind of

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,520
how do i do this how do i do that

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,679
hey i'm seeing this thing and it looks

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,960
kind of weird i don't have all the

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,600
information to really

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,880
make it an issue but i'm just curious

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
about what's going on

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,120
so it's kind of these vague things that

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,679
come in through issues i really don't

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
i didn't like the what we did before is

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
we kind of just be like if you don't

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,760
have a reproduction use case

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,600
i'm going to close your issue but now in

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,799
instead of doing that i get to

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,280
kind of just say okay we're going to

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,760
move this over to discussions it can go

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
into

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,960
ideas or q a or just kind of general

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,400
discussion you know and it's still

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,440
visible to the internet

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
it gets indexed for seo

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,160
people you know see those questions

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,080
coming in if they're watching the repo

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,840
but it doesn't necessarily get tracked

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,080
as an issue and it doesn't like

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,679
put a big old number you know above your

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,320
issue count

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,440
saying you know this this repo has you

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
know 600

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,919
issues well it turns out that only you

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,320
know 100 of those are actually issues

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,640
500 of them are questions that

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
the contributors and maintainers have

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
failed to close or triage

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,919
so i think it's it's been solving that

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,880
problem

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
uh at least for me thank you for that

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
and we've

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,720
got some um react query love in the chat

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,760
we've got

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,840
solution loves react query um lit share

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,640
for various reasons we've disabled link

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,559
sharing

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,400
um so feel free to post your um

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
your comment again and i'll post the

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,039
link for you because it is a

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,880
um a twitch link uh a github link so

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,760
i've posted the link there for you again

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,440
um let's feel free to um write your

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
comments again with disabled link

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,000
sharing

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,799
um but again tana thank you so much but

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,600
i love hearing um

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,799
that kind of um culture around

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,880
discussions because that's one of the

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,200
main reasons why we built discussions

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
is for for the exact reasons that you're

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,080
talking about which is

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,919
you know you notice things are happening

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,120
in an issue where originally issues were

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,440
designed to

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
open an issue because there's an issue

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
like there's a thing that needs to be

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
fixed or a feature needs to be

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,720
implemented rather than

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,400
something that just needs to be

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,200
discussed so we're super

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
happy that like you know you discussions

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,240
being used to that and

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
i think you've called it out to us that

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,440
that um

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
that feature to be able to change

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,799
something or convert an issue to a

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,080
discussion vice versa

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,760
so if you're having a discussion about

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,679
something really like in-depth thing

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,799
okay no we have now decided that we want

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
this to be a feature

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,480
and go bang convert to an issue and

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,159
build that into a feature so

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,720
that's really cool that you're using it

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,600
in that way

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,480
yeah it's it's been a game changer i'm

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,799
glad i have it i

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,000
i enabled it on all of my repos as fast

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,840
as possible

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,520
just like hit that button enable

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
discussions across everything i really

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
really like it

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
um just double checking if you've got

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
any other questions

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,600
keep those questions coming through the

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,559
chat we'd love to hear from you all

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,520
uh now so what i want to talk about next

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
is

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,400
route query as an open source product

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
now obviously it's an open source

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
project and um as we

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,559
showed before you've got over 190

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,240
contributors almost 200 contributors

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,080
um if i was a new person coming to

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,280
react query for the first time wanting

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,679
to contribute

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,720
what would i do walk me through your

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,679
process

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
of getting someone to contribute to your

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,320
your project and

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,120
onboarding them in the right manner

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
okay well i think this goes for most

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
projects but

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
the easiest way to contribute to a

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,159
project

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,799
is to look at the issues so

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,400
for for really any github project most

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,280
github projects you can go into the

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
issues tab

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,120
and there's going to be a label

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,400
that is either labeled like you know

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
first time

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,840
contributor or easy pick or something

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
like that

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,679
um are yours do you have good first

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,120
issues good first issue

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,559
yep and not not at the moment but

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,799
unfortunately we don't have any at the

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,320
moment um and that's okay

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,320
you know it doesn't mean that there

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,000
isn't going to be one in the future

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,080
but uh there's a couple of close ones

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,880
we'll close one there

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,840
as can as maintainers and contributors

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,600
to a library

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,080
um it's important for us to like when we

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,120
find

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,400
an issue that could be solved easily but

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,159
is not necessarily

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,440
uh you know like a a massive issue

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,520
uh those are the things that we mark as

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,280
you know good good first issue it's good

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,080
for a first-time contributor

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,520
and um from there it's kind of like if

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
you if you find one of those and you

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,679
want to work on it

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,039
the next thing you need to do is go read

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,760
the contributing

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,080
documentation inside of the repo so most

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,520
repos have a contributing dock

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,240
right inside it's all caps yep and

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
everything inside of here is supposed to

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
tell you

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,559
how you're supposed to help us work on

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,960
this

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,080
repo there might be some suggestions in

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,279
here on

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,640
like what we consider issues or features

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,720
or how to discuss them

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
and you can actually see that right

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,520
there it says issues are identified as

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,120
implementation questions or non-issues

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
are immediately closed or redirected to

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,960
github discussions

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,039
so kind of teaching you kind of how to

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,440
triage issues as well

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,520
which is something that is extremely

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
helpful i don't think

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,720
newcomers understand that contributing

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,840
to open source

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,679
doesn't always mean writing code

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,360
it doesn't have to be that you write

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,159
code and submit a pr

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,000
some of the best contributions i've had

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,679
are from people who just kind of

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,480
watch the issues and the discussions and

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,640
uh they'll use those discussions that

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,600
crop up that are just kind of like hey

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,799
how do i do this but you know or how

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,720
does this work

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,400
and it gives you an opportunity as a

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
first time contributor to

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,480
learn something about the library and

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,120
then go and answer that question

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
and that doesn't require you to to

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,320
really

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,760
write any code at all it's a it's a

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,120
great way to get involved

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,600
and to start understanding the library

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,760
and then once you do have the level of

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,559
understanding that you need

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
and also by helping triage issues like

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,159
that

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,960
you um it's really nice

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,039
for maintainers to see that so if you

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,679
ever want to get on a maintainer's good

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,000
side

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,559
go into the issues of the discussions

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,120
and try and help answer questions and

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,320
get more information in triage we love

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,640
that

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,799
and then when it finally comes time that

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
you want to submit some code

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,720
you know even if it's something as

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
simple as fixing some typos in the

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,200
documentation

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,080
um this the rest of this documentation

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,039
here in the

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,720
contributing doc is going to help you

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,039
get up and running

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
it should have instructions on there on

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,960
how to

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
kind of spin up the the repo to clone it

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,799
and how to run tests

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,320
right yep there's the one click set up

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,159
right there

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
and all the instructions you need to

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,720
commit your code to the to the repo

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,159
so this is and this is pretty standard

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,960
or it should be across

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,640
any github repo that you come to this is

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,480
a pretty good contributing um

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
document so you're saying like you want

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,919
people to come in you want them to read

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
the contribution guidelines and you want

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
them to kind of be

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
part of the community a little bit too

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,520
like you know sitting back and having a

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
look at discussions and

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,679
looking at the issues and just being a

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
little bit involved we've got some

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,640
people in the chat like

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
obviously glenn they're saying yes

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,080
non-code submissions can be just as

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
useful as code submissions

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,039
exhibit a yes the docs and i just

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,799
noticed when we're going through the

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,679
issues that one of your

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,640
issues is tagged with documentation um

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,039
which is you know

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
go and fix some documentation there

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,640
probably write something new

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,400
or go and do some bug features there you

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
go remove these do these

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,200
write some things um and we've also got

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,400
brian saying improving docs and examples

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
of some of the most helpful and high

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
impact ways to contribute which

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,159
i think is amazing and um on that hi

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,880
brian

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,919
brian mitch l proving code examples yeah

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,360
i just think it's

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,039
that's really good i've seen like so

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
many people come in and

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,080
yeah do as you mentioned like spelling

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,440
errors

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,760
um you know fixing headings um

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
i think the examples one is a good one i

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,880
noticed through um throughout

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,480
hacktoberfest even

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
a lot of the open source uh projects

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,279
that are

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,640
opted in for uh for hacktoberfest are

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,600
actually asking people to provide

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,760
examples

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,760
uh and more examples of certain things

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,000
so you know provide an example of this

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,960
code working in xyz and i think that's

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
just

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,080
like those types of documentation i

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,880
think is really really helpful and

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,960
um speaking of examples i really have

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,320
enjoyed the example architecture for

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,760
react query our examples is

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:38,000
it's just a directory of

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:42,000
folders that are code sandbox projects

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,159
so if and and you can use the

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,720
link that code sandbox gives you to

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,559
automatically import from github

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,520
so the code sandbox sources of truth are

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,640
in the repo

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,640
in this directory and so if you ever

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,559
want to add a new example or improve it

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,440
you just do it on code sandbox

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,399
and then you can just push up the entire

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,799
folder

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,039
it's really fun and it's so good to have

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,720
more examples and lots of examples for

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,520
your library because

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
it helps people also submit better

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,200
issues

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
for your project you know they say i'm

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,320
having an issue with the uh

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,120
the infinite scrolling api on react

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
query i'll say

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,039
well perfect there's a code sandbox for

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,760
infinite scrolling right here

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,559
how about you just fork it and kind of

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,559
make it

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,679
make the bug happen and then send it to

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,760
me oh it's perfect

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
code sandbox is another tool that has

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
just revolutionized

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,039
uh open source for me i'm gonna grab

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,720
that lame code

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,399
sandbox and i'll pop in the chat close

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,240
but we've also got a few people echoing

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,960
up your sentiments about um

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
code sandbox saying it's incredible it's

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
amazing

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
um and we've got some people there in

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,640
the chat looks like they've been either

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,640
contributing to docs themselves

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,679
um or at least uh contributing to some

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
open source

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
uh so the next thing i want to talk

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,880
about really briefly um before i jump

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,919
into a little bit more

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,159
um about how you going to coding um

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,039
is we've you've just spoken about what

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,039
you

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,720
want first-time contributors to do when

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,080
they come to your repo

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,000
you want them to to read the

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,960
documentation to read the contribution

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,640
guidelines

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,640
check out what issues are there then be

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,799
part of the discussions to understand

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,240
how the community works now what are

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,919
your top tips

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,840
for people who maybe want to contribute

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,279
to a rat query but not sure about how to

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,880
go about it or even people just want to

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,240
contribute to open source in the first

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,760
place what are your tips

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,760
to those people who are kind of sitting

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
there going should i be doing this show

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,840
or not

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,679
is it good is it bad well i think one

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,200
important thing to remember about

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,840
contributing to open source

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,600
is if if you're not using open source

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,279
then it's going to make it harder for

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,440
you to contribute to it

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,919
if you want to contribute to a library

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,320
you need to start using it

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,080
and this is all this also goes along

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,960
with that saying that you need to dog

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,080
food

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,760
your own stuff that's why i always ask

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,279
myself when i start a new

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,240
project am i going to use this project

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,799
myself

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,000
in my own you know side projects or

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,919
company or

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,240
or businesses am i going to use this

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,840
long term and if the answer is yes then

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,679
i'm confident that i'm going to be able

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,799
to dog food

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,360
my own library and that's that's what

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
makes you

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,120
a good contributor i think is knowing

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,880
how to use it

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,399
in the real world knowing its

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,399
limitations and

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,799
maybe where it could be better right if

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,039
you don't have any of that experience

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,880
using a tool you're not necessarily

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
going to know how to fix the tool very

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,039
well

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,520
so if you're not sure where to start um

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,440
just go build something with it you know

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,799
whether it's react query or or

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,919
some other open source library just pick

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,559
any project any kind of fun mundane

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,679
thing

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,880
or you know those weird things that

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
you know it's not going to make you any

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,519
money but it really looks good on a

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,279
on a portfolio right like go start one

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,039
of those projects and use

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,960
whatever it is you want to learn about

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,640
and that's going to open up

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,000
uh it's going to open up more

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,760
opportunities in

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,519
your experience to contribute back to

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,440
the library

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,720
and you've been a maintainer for at

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,480
least a year now obviously

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,240
throughout query what are some of your

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,039
top tips that you've learned from

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,559
maintaining

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,640
this project that you would give to

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,720
other maintainers um

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,240
top tips around possibly the discord

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
discussions or just whatever kind of top

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,840
tips you've got for maintainers

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,440
maintaining their projects

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,679
um most of them we've kind of already

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,240
touched on the best one would be setting

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,600
up those

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,760
issue templates getting your issue

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,120
templates done

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,960
getting discussions turned on

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,960
having a community like discord

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,480
do you know requiring your users and

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,720
setting up the expectation to use code

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,840
sandbox to replicate issues

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,600
and making that easy for people to do uh

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,279
you know it's all about cutting that

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
feedback loop

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,320
down to the smallest amount of time

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,519
possible

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,039
for someone to tell you you know this is

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,799
wrong it needs to be better

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,159
and you can make it better and the

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
faster that you can go through that

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
cycle

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,120
uh the faster your open source library

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
is going to be able to grow

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,240
yeah i think that's a really really key

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,000
good point um

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,000
you know we're just reducing that time

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,679
because obviously people if people there

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
wanting to contribute they want to know

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,240
that

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,600
um that as a maintenance you're the one

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,399
that you're hearing them and that you're

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
actually

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,440
um is that yes there's a good

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
contribution or no it's not or hank we

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,360
tweet this if we tweak that so i think

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,519
um you know definitely reducing that

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,640
feedback time is really really helpful

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,840
now do you have any top tips or any like

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,279
slightly different

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,960
tips um for maintainers that are

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,519
starting a project for the first time so

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,279
obviously you started react query or and

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,559
and have you noticed any differences

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,080
between like

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,480
starting and building a project from

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,799
scratch um versus

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,440
maintaining a project or being a one of

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,480
the core maintainers of a project

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,440
yeah if you are going to start a new

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,320
project

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,240
in the beginning it's very easy to you

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,960
you have to have full ownership

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,320
of that code in the very beginning it's

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,360
it's all you

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,679
and uh you can't really expect anybody

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,360
else to help you or step in

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,200
and that can go on for quite a while it

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,960
could be months or years that that

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,720
happens even if your project gets very

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,080
very popular you might be the only

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,559
person that

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,159
can actually do anything about problems

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,880
or make it better

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,080
uh and you think that might that might

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
be the hardest part

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,760
but it's actually not in my opinion the

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,480
hardest part comes

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,240
when the community starts to grow and

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,440
you do get contributors and people who

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,720
want to help

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,960
um there i have experienced not just

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,799
with react query but with react to table

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,640
so some of the biggest challenges is

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,399
just letting go and sharing that

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,279
responsibility

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,720
allowing other people to you know you

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,440
need to be able to delegate

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,320
and allow other people to help you and

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,399
trust

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,919
that uh people are going to implement

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,560
things well and you need to

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,679
learn kind of how to manage i hate to

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,520
say that word

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,760
but you know when you become a

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
maintainer of a large library with lots

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
of contributors

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,520
you need to learn management skills and

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,879
you need to learn how to be kind

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,040
but also how to enforce expectations

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,240
um you need to know how to communicate

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,560
between

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,159
many people and facilitate discussions

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,119
between people who disagree

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,639
with each other those are the hard

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,760
long-term challenges that

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,240
kind of take people by surprise

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,440
at least they took me by surprise after

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,399
these libraries got

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,440
a lot of traction so nailing that down

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,079
early on

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,440
and really i think the best advice i can

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,640
give is just be kind

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,760
and remember that it's just code and no

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,599
no code is sacred code you know the

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,960
we're all in this to make the world a

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,280
better place and

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,240
as long as you're making the software

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,400
the best it can be

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,440
to help other people that's really what

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,560
matters the most

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
so get rid of your ego before you walk

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,680
in

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,040
i really love that no code is sacred

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,920
we're all in this to make the world a

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,200
better place i

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,839
really really love and super appreciate

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,520
that sentiment as well because that is

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,320
literally what open source is all about

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,560
right

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,000
um and i think what you've really

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,240
highlighted there

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
is something that um startups experience

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,599
a lot too which is

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,200
when you're growing from you know it's

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,359
much easier to grow from

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,200
one to ten people in a startup or one to

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,200
twenty people than it is to grow from 20

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,280
to 40 or 20 to 50.

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,640
because once you grow to that size you

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,520
start experiencing all things that

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,720
you've mentioned

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,720
you know the community wants to get

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,000
involved how do you um you know sort out

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,480
disputes how do you

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
you know sort out clashes in culture and

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
personalities and how do you

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,280
actually say like how do you start

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,280
letting go of things

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,119
so your community can then take it

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
because i mean i'm assuming

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,800
for most people that start open source

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,400
project they don't want to be working on

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,240
it just by themselves

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
you know forever and a day right you the

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
whole idea is to build a community

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,680
around it and have

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,280
other core maintainers that you can all

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,839
then you know push the products and the

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
project is no longer dependent on you

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:29,599
right

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,440
absolutely and i think that is the goal

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,119
yeah definitely and i think um that's

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,720
kind of like leads us into the next

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,400
little thing that i think that you want

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,880
to talk about at least uh and that's it

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,640
you have a startup as well correct

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
yeah cool do you want to talk to us a

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,160
little bit about your startup

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,560
sure um i i sent you a link there yep

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,359
yep

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,760
it's uh it's called it's called nozzle

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,000
and

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,280
uh i think that name is awesome by the

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,560
way um

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,599
but nozzle like a hose nozzle

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,920
yeah you know it's funny because um

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,079
this has nothing to do with what we are

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
today but in the very beginning that we

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,240
had

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
there were talks of making kind of like

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,599
a like a social

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,760
media aggregation um and funneling

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,119
software and so it kind of gave us the

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,160
idea of like oh it's a nozzle and you're

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,480
kind of like

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,079
you're you're focusing and spraying how

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,880
you know all of the uh

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,480
your tweets or your posts or whatever it

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,119
has nothing to do with social media but

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
the name

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,400
was so good that we just kind of

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,160
couldn't let go so

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,839
what nozzle is today is it is a rank

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,119
tracking software

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,000
and what is rank tracking

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,880
that's a great question rank tracking is

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,880
basically

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
reverse engineering google search

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,000
results

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,000
and sounds really cool we

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,520
we reverse engineer google search

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,480
results at scale

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,280
so for uh very large fortune 500 sized

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,960
companies

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,160
who have data analysts and people who

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,200
are just

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,839
really data hungry and data junkies they

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,560
need all of this data at scale so they

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,320
can make

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
you know informed decisions for their

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,520
marketing team and seo

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,000
and we are one of the very few companies

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
that

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,720
can actually supply that data at the

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,760
scale that these companies need

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,760
so we are just crawling google

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,400
reverse crawling google search results

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,520
all day and

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,520
categorizing and you know tagging

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,800
and we're storing all of this into

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,000
structured

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,160
as structured database in uh

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,280
you know these massive big data

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,839
databases

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,480
and we provide that data back to people

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,119
yeah

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
we provide that back to people either

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,200
through an api

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,480
or obviously the front end which is

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,599
where i come in

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,720
so from day one i have been all

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,480
all front end so all ui and ux

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,839
uh for nozzle and i have one employee

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,480
uh who is helping me now but we

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,720
together we have built all of the

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,640
application and marketing and front end

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,160
everything for nozzles so it's been a

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,079
lot of fun

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,599
this is cool maybe going since july

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,720
2012.

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,920
yeah this is really cool nice website by

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,079
the way

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,400
this is what i like about like coders

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,920
and stuff you like get into like

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,440
stops and things it's like you just have

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,800
like really nice websites everybody just

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
looks amazing so

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,040
nice work and now i've got a question

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,440
from the chat as well which is um back

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,839
onto github as well so if you want um

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,440
go check out tana's uh really really

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,040
cool startup nozzle i've put the link in

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,040
the chat is there as well

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,040
um but we've got a question from the

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,040
chat and then we're gonna finish up on a

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,280
couple ask questions for me which is

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,560
once you create a github project

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,560
how does it become open source and how

00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,720
do you get it to visible to something

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,599
like it like what npm is basically up to

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,920
yeah you kind of touched on a little bit

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,560
um

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
yeah once you create a github repo i i

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,119
would say it's open source

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,319
because yeah basically the code is open

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,960
it's there people can look at it so uh

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,079
you know i guess that's what means open

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,079
source yeah so

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,280
so essential once you so basically

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,720
there's two types of github right

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,119
there's github private there's github

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,560
public so any public thing

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,960
and actually i'm going to ask you this

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,160
tanner as well any public repo

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,240
is publicly available

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,960
technically speaking that doesn't

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,720
necessarily mean it's open source though

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,560
so if you want something to be open

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,720
source you need to have an

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,319
open source license that states that

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,560
your code is open source

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,079
that allows other people to use it and

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,760
allows and says that you're giving

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,240
everyone else a license to go and use

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,920
that

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,839
um there's lots of really cool ones but

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,160
why i got google hours

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,000
uh i wanted to hear from tana what you

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,960
use for your open source license

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,119
and which um one you chose for your open

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,240
source license for react query

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,599
i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure we use

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,960
the mit license

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,000
yeah um it's extremely permissive and

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,000
um and very flexible so

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,119
i i i'm pretty sure i try and use the

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,119
mit license for

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
everything that i do so we've got the

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,440
mit one

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,920
here um so you can grab this on we also

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,280
have

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,359
the other one that i just posted in the

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,400
chat for those people who are um

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,160
keen to have a look is um this one

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,079
called literally choose a license so the

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,640
mit one is on there

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,079
um but it basically goes through like

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,280
what you're doing this is actually a

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
very interesting point because lots of

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,680
people have

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,839
no idea about open source licensing um

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,880
so yeah basically you need to choose a

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,160
license that

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,960
gives everyone else um

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,640
ownership or you like use of going out

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
and using that code because if you just

00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,680
put up a

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,000
public repo um and there's no license on

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,000
it

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,440
theoretically people can't go and then

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,280
open source to everyone else because

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
as the writer you haven't given everyone

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,680
the the the license

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,720
to go and actually use that so that is

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,720
one big thing is

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,800
oh there you go glenn say thanks for

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,160
making it mit

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,839
then they thought you would have used

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,720
the apache two one but they're they're

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,400
happy um

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,319
glenn is very very happy you're using

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
the mit one

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,920
uh but yeah basically make sure you've

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,240
got license on yours if we go and have a

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,599
quick

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,480
look again back at the um the repo

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,720
for react query you'll see there there

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,960
is an actual license on there

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,960
um

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,359
so here is your open source license so

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,359
everyone needs to make sure you've got

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,599
one there you go yours is the mit one

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,119
licensed under mit so it says here that

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,920
basically um

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,200
tana and the team are providing this

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,800
that you can use it for commercial use

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
modification distribution and private

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,760
use

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,800
um there is no liability and warranty on

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,480
it um

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,160
and obviously everything is written down

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,599
here so it's really really

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,960
um easy and um

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,720
just make sure you have it if you

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,480
just make sure that your code is able to

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,880
be like out there and use for open

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
source

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,079
is there anything else you want to say

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,760
that on that channel um

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,319
no well i actually i have been looking

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,880
into

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,440
something called dual licensing lately

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,920
so

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,440
not for react query but for some other

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,119
projects i'm working on

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,119
that are more of like an enterprise

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,880
product so there would definitely be

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,640
more businesses that would be interested

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,960
in using it than

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,079
just kind of hobbyists or open source

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
projects

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,359
and that would be an interesting

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,720
discussion we'd probably have to have

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,520
later but there is something called dual

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,599
licensing

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,680
where um you can open source license

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:54,000
uh for people who are using it for

00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,160
non-commercial things and then you

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,680
can have a separate license available

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,800
for the same code

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,160
that lets people use it for private use

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,680
or commercial use

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,119
um and but they you know you have to set

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,920
up some type of a

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,960
you know a payment for that license um

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,920
there's lots of people

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,560
working on how to make that uh better

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,480
too

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,920
and i wish i knew more about it which is

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,520
why i'm kind of learning about it right

00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,760
now

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,960
but it sounds really exciting to me

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,680
because i know there i

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,119
are a lot of businesses that use my open

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
source software and

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,440
when i see those business names i kind

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,680
of like wow i'm so excited that they're

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,800
using my software and then i'm like

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,400
wow i wish they could you know donate

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,400
like a thousand dollars to the project

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,599
or something and i think that's

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,359
and that's one of the key reasons why i

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
bought in github sponsors too right so i

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,960
noticed that um

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,079
query is part of github sponsors so have

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,280
you found

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,880
that um experience

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,200
github sponsors has been great um

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,240
and it's been great because i think it's

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,720
enabled

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,760
more businesses to contribute back to

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,200
open source

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,440
and i think that's been the biggest

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,640
problem and github sponsors is not

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,920
technically perfect

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,040
i have calls with github uh r

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:15,040
d and and people who want feedback on on

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,720
sponsors all the time and one thing i'm

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,160
always telling them is that i hope

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,520
very soon or in the near future that uh

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,720
github sponsors in my opinion should

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,520
should be better built to um

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,720
help sponsorships from companies and

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,599
businesses

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,839
uh up to this up to now you know a lot

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,680
of sponsorships that are happening today

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,640
in fact i'd say a majority of them are

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,200
probably happening between developers

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,920
we're really just kind of moving money

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,720
around

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
between ourselves right so it's like

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,119
open source

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,839
money just kind of circulating and

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,440
what's going to solve um kind of all

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,720
that burnout and all of that

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,319
uh open source sustainability stuff

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,480
that kind of gets talked about here and

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,680
there is is um

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,680
having more money come in from

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,720
businesses that that are

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,920
uh using open source software and being

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,800
very successful

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,240
so definitely we know there are a lot of

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,520
businesses that are using the

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,800
sponsorship program

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,560
um but yeah you're right it'd be cool to

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,680
see a few more and i know you're going

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,160
to just put the

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,400
license back onto the licensing is that

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,560
licensing is boring but required and we

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,720
could literally spend

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,680
hours sitting here talking about

00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,200
licensing

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,359
copyright iop um but yeah we won't

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,760
uh we've only got about um a few minutes

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,319
left so turn out to end us off i would

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,280
like to

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,119
you to it was a really brief i don't

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,079
know how long the story is but just give

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,960
us a brief

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,640
insight in how you got involved firstly

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,119
in coding and then secondly in open

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,359
source

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,400
well in high school i wrote my first

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,160
html

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,040
and uh it wasn't css files back then but

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,560
my first styles

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
right and that that came very naturally

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,440
to me

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,280
and i never really considered it to be

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,400
like a career path though

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,599
um it was a lot of fun javascript wasn't

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,119
um super powerful then so it

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,599
kind of wasn't as big a deal as this

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,640
today but it was definitely there

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,359
and uh but at the time i wanted to get

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,640
into

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,400
uh film and audio engineering i went to

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,200
school for film and audio engineering

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,200
for a while

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,800
actually um until i ran out of money

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,119
couldn't go couldn't keep going to

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,000
school and instead of going into debt

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,440
i decided i was going to try and work my

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
way through school

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,520
and that's when i decided that building

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,760
websites was actually a very

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,440
lucrative way to make money and i was

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,319
pretty i was pretty good at it

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,040
so i started building websites and

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,400
eventually

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,359
you know worked my way into the

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,880
wordpress scene building wordpress sites

00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,960
uh very low code uh

00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,359
coding i guess you could call it with

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,319
wordpress i started building some custom

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,800
php plugins for wordpress and then i

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,640
really

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,559
kind of took off when i discovered

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,559
angular um

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:16,079
this i can't remember what year this was

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:21,040
but it was like 2012 i believe

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:24,319
um angular angular really got me excited

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,960
um about about javascript

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,400
and so i started learning about

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,280
javascript and angular kind of at the

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,319
same time

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,480
and that's when i started i actually was

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,960
an employee for my startup before

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,119
i was a co-founder i was the very first

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,720
employee of my own startup

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,960
uh doing all the front-end work

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,240
and then eventually i became a

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,200
co-founder

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,640
and then it was time to migrate to react

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,760
because angular 1x

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,520
was just getting old and angular 2 was

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,520
dragging its feet for a couple years so

00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,680
yeah that that's kind of the quick story

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,280
of how i got into

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,319
coding in general and react

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,920
from there my open source work really

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,200
took off when i contributed to

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,760
chart js i needed a charting library

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,200
i really liked chart js but i it could

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,559
be much better

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,119
so i came in with another a friend

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,079
from canada and together we wrote

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,280
version 2

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,240
of chart js and released that

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,319
and it was a lot of fun i don't ever

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,440
want to work with the canvas api again

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,599
but

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,359
it's like the one time i did it was good

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,440
let's just leave that one time as one

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,800
time one time

00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
yeah um and really chart js is where

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,280
kind of

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,559
things really took off after that uh

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,960
chart.js

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,680
was fun i wanted to start something new

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,440
so i got into

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,440
i started building some things around

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,920
crossfilter from square

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,040
which is now deprecated i believe and

00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,359
then

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,119
about a year later i built react table

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,119
and that was the very first library i

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,559
had that really took off

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:11,520
after react table i built react

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,200
static which is a static site generator

00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,839
and then

00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,480
gatsby and next js came along with a lot

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,839
of like

00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,680
money and investors and you know

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,400
tons of people behind it and it was just

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,640
kind of like me versus the world and i

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,599
decided i decided not to keep working on

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,559
react static

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,000
but shortly after that um i started

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:36,160
working on what would become

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,119
react query that is very very cool i

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,720
like how like

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,160
everything's just kind of like flown

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,240
from one to the next

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,599
uh if you say like i just started

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,079
building websites and now i'm like an

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,880
open source maintainer it kind of like

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,480
doesn't really compute but when you talk

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,480
about each step you know you're like

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,640
yeah i can really see how each one

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,920
um you know float onto the next and how

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,599
you're just kind of like

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,640
at the right point in time for those

00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,040
things i think that's what a lot of

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,559
people don't like realize that you've

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,920
you've kind of you've got to do those

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,800
things at the very start you've got to

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,280
just start you're

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,079
building random websites and random

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,920
wordpress

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,760
plugins and finding an open source

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,480
project that is really cool that you

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,240
want to use

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,000
that you then go hey it could be better

00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,640
let's fix it and build this cool thing

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,839
for it

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,480
and i think that's how a lot of people

00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,680
get into open source now to end us off

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,119
because we're nearly there at the end

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,040
but i will take any last minute

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,240

for people who are sitting there going i

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,640
want to be like that

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,079
i want to learn how to code like that i

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,720
want to get involved in open source like

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,640

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,720
um what are your top tips for people who

00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,200

any kind of experience in that kind of

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,920
sector or what are your

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,920
what are your tips and advice to those

00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,280
kind of people

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,400
i would say put yourself in a

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,440
challenging situation

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,680
you know i told my story and

00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,599
the most important part of my story

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,480
honestly was that i

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,599
became a part of a startup uh that was

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,839
trying to solve

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,960
very difficult problems with very few

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,720
people

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,640
and when you're put under that kind of

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,920
pressure in trying to solve hard

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,480
problems

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,680
with limited resources that's when open

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,280
source becomes

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,119
a gold mine you know you can build

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,440
so much with open source software these

00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,200
days and

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,280
you know but you're not going to unless

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,520
you have to so

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,520
i don't know for me personally i think

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,640
the best motivation for

00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,559
uh learning open source is starting a

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,200
business and trying to build something

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:54,000
from nothing and open source tools are

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,760
going to be essential

00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,280
i definitely resonate with the almost

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,119
founder myself and uh definitely

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,400
building something for nothing is

00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,760
a challenge that you uh takes a certain

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,200
kind of person but if you're sitting

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,280
there you want to do it

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,119
i think that's a resonating fact we've

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,440
had from nearly all of our guests

00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,119
throughout the um the weeks is you just

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,240
got to get out there and do it but i

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,760
really like that specific nature that

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,200
you've called out not just get out there

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,359
and do it or not just give it a go but

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,599
actually give yourself a challenge

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,960
put yourself in a challenging situation

00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,280
and see what you can make of it

00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,640
we've had 10 in the chat said very

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,280

promote it as much as you can

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,599
talk about it start building it and when

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,280
it gets to the point where

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,200
you are building a community you just

00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,440
gotta let go of your ego

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,119
let go of your sacred code because

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,319
there's no such thing as sacred code

00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,640
it's all open source

00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,319
let go of that and just like send it out

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,880

um as santa said again

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,480
startup discord server it's a really

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,599
really good place to collaborate with

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,000
your community
