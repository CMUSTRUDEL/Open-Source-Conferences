Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 23rd October 2020, 2pm AEDT. We interviewed Tanner Linsley from React Query, an open source hook for fetching, caching, and updating data. We had the chance to deep dive into Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Tanner gave us some top tips of building a product from scratch, giving yourself a challenge, and some of the cool GitHub features to enable to ensure success of your open source project.
