Title: Building a text editor, like it's 1999 - Remirror - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2020-10-16
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	remirror was started as a personal challenge. Would it be possible to build an editor that combined great performance with ease of use? It was also important to give users of all frameworks, the ability to build an editor by picking and choosing their desired building blocks.

uh i'm curious though so you're doing

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
open source today

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,359
i'm curious of like maybe your

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,880
background and how you got into

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,840
engineering like did you go to you have

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,120
a proper cs degree as well

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,640
no so i i did

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,960
economics at university and

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,840
it was it was completely wrong i

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
i was so bad i and i didn't enjoy it and

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,480
i wish i'd kind of like

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
known that i could wait and try other

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,680
so after that i kind of went down that

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,680
path you know working in

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
maybe finance related roles and those

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,719
kind of those kind of roles and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
none of them really like vibe with me so

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
but what i did notice is while i was

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,760
working in these roles i noticed

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,360
that i was always drawn to the products

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,520
so i worked the groupon

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,879
i worked up and like i would always be

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
really interested in how can we make the

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,559
product better

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,800
and and it made sense like based on that

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
just just some introspection i felt like

00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
it'd be so cool if i could build stuff

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,399
like a design stuff where i could make

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,480
things

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
that people use because when you have

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
someone who's annoyed at you because

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
your your product failed it's it's hard

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
to take

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
um so that that kind of began my journey

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
into coding and it wasn't a short

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
journey

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
i think some people um say they they

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,680
want to learn to code and

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,360
it took me a while it took me a lot of

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
false starts like maybe we can discuss

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,240
this later but

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,159
i had to discover the way i would learn

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
in the most effective way

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,920
but yeah anyway so so from there i i

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
kind of got into coding and

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
um and the the passion was always

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,640
building products that people

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,600
can love using um because i'd seen

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
what bad products can do and the stress

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
they cause not just

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,320
not just the users but the people who

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
have to explain why your product is so

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,680
bad

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,880
um as part of your company yeah so would

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
you say that the um

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,159
having your ability to code kind of

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
gives you like

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,399
maybe superpower is not the right term

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
but having the ability to actually solve

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
problems

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
through code like has that so open a lot

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,360
of doors for you

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,240
i i definitely feel like it it's a

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,840
superpower

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,640
yeah um i i i i would maybe not go that

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
far but

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,920
you almost it's almost like it's almost

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
like being a painter

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,760
in like in venice in in the uh like in

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,560
in in the renaissance or being um an

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,239
industrialist

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
during the industrial revolution you

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,239
almost like you have this power to build

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
to build like the future in a way that

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
no one has had

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,319
prior prior to this and and and

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,760
so so that that's that's kind of what i

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
see you almost like

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
coding gives you this space where you

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
can create something that no one's ever

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
thought of

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
and release it to the world and see how

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,920
they react in real time

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
so it is a superpower and it's a

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,239
well-paid superpower

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,000
yeah yeah that is true i mean i i'm very

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,360
very happy with uh what i'm getting paid

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
as well so highly recommend if you

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
aren't engineering today like open

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,400
source a really good

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
like it's a great introduction into like

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
actually working in

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
engineering teams um it's a really cool

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
introduction just to

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,800
collaborating and solving problems

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
through code um

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
so i'm a big fan for obvious reasons

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
like this is what i'm doing

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,519
um day to day yeah um so

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
yeah definitely so d can you talk a bit

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,000
about

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,560
uh so you're based in the uk right is

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,920
that correct yes it is uh

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,159
so what um i'm curious of like

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
how did you get to the point where

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
you're

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
building re-mirror like what was the

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,560
story like that what's the the longer

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,599
tail story of how that how you got to

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
this point

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
i'm so glad you asked great question

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,879
also

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,480
so for me actually i had like a weird

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,239
journey into coding so i

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,879
i i'm very i find it hard to say okay

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
i'm gonna

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
do this and then and then work for it so

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
the way i learned to code was actually

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
like just jumping around different

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,319
things

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,319
um and uh so i actually i learned

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,840
i did a i did like half the udacity

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,120
course on python it was an intro to

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
computer science i'm so grateful for

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
that course that course

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,959
wait how long ago was that so this was

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,879
this was in 2014.

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,159
okay maybe no 2013. i was 2013 2014 so

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,439
around that time so it was kind of like

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
i was kind of like picking things up

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,239
slowly

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,439
i did there's a lot of stuff i did that

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
wasn't very helpful

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,680
but one thing i did learn a lot from was

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,519
reading through

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,680
so backbone at the time was was a big

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,280
framework backbone i don't know

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
yeah i'm familiar hopefully some other

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,400
people are familiar but yeah basically

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,600
watered-down version of react yeah

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,120
but the really great thing about

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,560
backbone was the source code was

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
commented so well

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,000
you could actually learn to code by

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,560
reading the source code so i i would i

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
would like

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
like because javascript back then is in

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,199
javascript now javascript today is like

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
beautiful you have like restructuring

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,759
you have all of this really cool stuff

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,479
javascript back then if you wanted to

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
create a class

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,919
you have to know about prototype syntax

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
all of this stuff so having someone

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
who'd

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,840
built something that was used by so many

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
people and yet had

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,360
endeavoured to make the source code

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
available and it was

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
a lot of it was reading it through

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
github so that was really helpful

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
i got into coffeescript coffeescript was

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
my favorite language um again this is

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
all this is all me just doing

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,440
i love coffeescript coffeescript is just

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
it's always got a place in my heart i

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,880
think going from python to coffeescript

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,440
made a lot more sense to go from

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,720
iphone to javascript and and so i

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,400
started working at a technical role so

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,759
this wasn't as a developer this was back

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,440
in 2014.

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
so i was like i was one of those those

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
people who this is just me trying to get

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
into into this industry

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,240
um and i learned that actually i was

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
quite good at coding

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
uh no one gave me opportunities but the

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
one time a programmer was away

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
and there's a problem that needed a bug

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
fix and i looked at it i was like oh i

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,520
could fix this

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
and i fixed it and that was i wasn't yet

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
officially a developer this was maybe

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,479
2015 but for me that was a turning point

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
when i realized that

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
the stuff i'd learned was was actually

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,360
really beneficial

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
um and even before i was contributing

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,960
the github became like my home on the

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
internet you just like read through

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
projects

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
you know like everything like it's it's

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,000
it's like

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
the world's knowledge i actually see

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
github is more than code

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,639
i see github is like it's like almost

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
like the repository for the world's

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
knowledge

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
like yeah basically anything almost

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
anything that

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
that's useful um can can be something

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
about

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
i know i'm picking you up yeah i even

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,800
more even before

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,560
like this conversation i mean i i

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
represent github but hopefully some

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
some github pms are are watching because

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
they're probably super excited to hear

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
that

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,960
um the way you explain how github uh

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,120
sort of a good marketing speak i think

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
we should add that to the website

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
i i genuinely i i tweeted this the

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
minute like i've got bought by microsoft

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,199
everyone all my friends are saying oh

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
how can you spend so much on the company

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
i was like

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
are you kidding me github is like they

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
have just bought

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,240
they've brought the gateway to every

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,280
developer's heart in in the world it's

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,280
like it's almost like

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
anyway i don't want to get into like how

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
businesses work but

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
yeah for me it was it's so under it's

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,680
like it's like buying youtube for 1.6

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,440
billion we don't look at that say that

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
that was too much it's that kind of

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,039
purchase that that to me is how

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,800
how big your hub is and how much yeah

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
love it what microsoft has done

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
since buying it is actually even better

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,199
than i expected they've really like

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
ramped up giving us like

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
ci bills for free and all this stuff

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
it's just amazing yeah and like great

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
job

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
your mention of youtube is like um it's

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
a really interesting uh

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
correlation because youtube i you

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,639
organically find yourself

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
on youtube um yeah all the time like if

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
you want to learn how to like you know

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
change your plumbing or

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,199
you know fix change the oil in your car

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,680
like you might go to youtube first like

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,479
having

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,000
the the sort of visual representation of

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
like how something is done like i

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
learned how to bake bread from youtube

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
uh i learned how to write javascript

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
from youtube well

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
some some javascript some really bad

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
javascript but um but

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,479
there's a lot of there's a wealth of

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,360
content i think with github like being

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
able to have

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,400
like i think you saying gateway is

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,720
actually really apt

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,160
as well uh because it is a gateway to so

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
many other things like

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
right now i'm using obs to actually

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,840
stream this

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,879
obs is an open source software um that's

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,479
actually

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
available to me i can see how it works i

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,280
can contribute to it

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
i can learn how to do it and that could

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
give me another job into some other

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,759
streaming software

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
because i have that knowledge and

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
someone's someone's throwing it all out

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
there for me to learn

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,759
and i could just walk in there be like i

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,759
have i have the expertise

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,240
for doing video codecs and processing

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,360
and working with bandwidth and like low

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
bandwidth situations

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,319
on obs which is a open source software

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
that which will then get me my foot in

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,680
the door for something else so it's a

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,599
yeah i'm i'm i'm right there with you

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,879
yeah

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
you're doing you're doing well your

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,320
company's doing really well

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,599
so yeah uh like um github was just

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,800
became almost like my home on the

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
internet i was using github more than

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,919
using social media i still do now

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,919
like um so what

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
i again i think the way i learn is very

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,080
broad there are people who can be very

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
narrow and focused on their learning

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
they can they can say okay i'm gonna

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
learn this

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
and then learn it i'm like oh this is

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
interesting i i have to almost follow

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
the trail of thoughts uh until it leads

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
me to something and eventually it led me

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
to learning react i learned about ember

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,040
i

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
i kind of landed maybe more on front-end

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,120
development

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,920
um and up until that point i'd always

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
kind of seen like

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
contributors to open sources just these

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,640
special people you know they're like

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,080
really smart and

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
and i'm just a learner and there's

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,240
there's this um there's that even though

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,760
by that point now i had a job i was

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,920
working full-time as a software

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,760
engineer i was doing some good things

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
for the people i worked for i

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
built i built some things that were oh

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,839
okay let me jump let me jump back so one

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
of the things that i did in the company

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,600
before i became like an official

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,880
software engineer

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,959
and was still live now for for the

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
company i worked for it was it was an ad

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
tracking

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,360
thing but i like as someone who hadn't

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,959
had any um

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
uh what's it called um like any any any

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,160
cs training it was just purely from

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
learning on the internet um i

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
introduced i brought browserify into the

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,959
internet product i brought unit testing

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,560
we our company didn't have any unit

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,480
testing that's how bad it was

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,080
all of these things and i bought them

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
because i learned about them

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
by reading code on github and so it was

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
it was almost like

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
open source even though i wasn't

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
contributing yet it was contributing to

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,279
me

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,720
in like a huge way so how did you learn

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,279
so did you learn on the job

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
or how did you do your day job but still

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,079
learn all this new stuff

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
like you mentioned reading github but

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
like yeah that's that sounds kind of

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
daunting for someone who's like just

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
trying to keep their head above water

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,399
and like

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,440
ship features um

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,200
so i i definitely did learn i on the job

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
i i kind of got to the point where

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
because the job i was doing was very

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
repetitive

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,880
and i i really struggled to do the same

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
thing over and over again so i i started

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,680
trying to automate what i was doing so i

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
would justify

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
or justify the fact that i wasn't

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
working by the fact that actually the

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
work i'm putting in

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,120
is to make me faster and it actually did

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
we built i built

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,839
me and a friend so we both kind of were

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,680
in the same journey he done a cs degree

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,519
i i hadn't but we were both like

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,640
realized actually we're way

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,320
we're very technical we're more

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,839
technical than anyone else or like we

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
have a natural interest

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,920
in what we're doing so we we started

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,160
pairing up we built um

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,839
an animations module so the company i

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,959
work for i don't want to give a name

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,279
yeah you can get but they they were

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
they're

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,000
they're that kind of company who you

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
know when you leave a website and then

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
they send you an email saying hey you

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
haven't you didn't finish doing what

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
you're doing

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
do you want to finish your or do you

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
want to finish shopping and they have

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,279
all these pop-up windows that show up

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,399
so what we what we did was we built an

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
animations

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,640
tool that basically made it when you

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,160
were leaving

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,680
rather than just showing because for

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
some reason they just showed you've got

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
this so that you

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,680
animate in you'd have like little like

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,320
really cool things happening

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,519
um and yeah so so these are like this is

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,440
my introduction to

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,920
so i justified i learnt on the job

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
but i justified in my mind by saying i'm

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
not

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,079
using my company time for waste i'm

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,959
actually using it to make

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
the company better um even though we did

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,880
get some stick like oh you're not

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,639
meeting targets

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
for this week it's like just wait wait

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,639
wait in two three weeks time

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah and we did we ended up um

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,680
increasing the

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
productivity of the whole team do you

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
feel like that you you adventure because

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,720
you

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,440
2013 2014 they'll do udacity courses

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,040
like

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
not having a cs degree do you feel like

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,399
you leveled up as an engineer

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,800
by doing some of this uh discovery

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,720
uh as in do you think are you saying

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,639
junior the senior to

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
staff or like do you feel like the skill

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,120
set that you learn like are you able

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,959
to enjoy that investment of your time

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,320
today oh no 100 of course yeah yeah

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,200
100 it was it was well worth the time i

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
i i think i think what what i would

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
advise to anyone who's trying to get

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
into the journey is

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,639
is not to put pressure on yourself

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
because i think sometimes you see

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
someone who's like oh i started learning

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,040
six months ago and now look at me i'm

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,519
working for i don't know

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,880
a big company if i if i'd been like

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
judging myself by that standard i

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,639
probably would have felt

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,760
really like negative but each person has

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
a different journey each person has a

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,079
different way of learning there's a

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
different thing that vibes with them

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
sometimes i watch like tutorials online

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,279
and they'll be like

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
like do this now if you're not doing it

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,800
you're not learning did you do

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,000
i don't learn like that i i learn by

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
like just watching and just getting a

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
stream of information and then maybe a

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,839
month later

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
trying out what i learned it's a very

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,839
like almost like a very distant kind of

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
learning and

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,279
it's so weird i i learned about um you

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
know

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,680
i've learned about docker i've learned

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,399
about kubernetes i've learned about all

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
of these things

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,839
and i've never really used them but just

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
that knowledge in the back of my head

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
means that when a problem comes it's

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
like i have this arsenal and

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,320
google exists right so even if i don't

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,000
know the details i can find out i can

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
spend like a day and now i'm an expert

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,040
or

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
much

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
so yeah there's there's i think each

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
person has to find

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,880
the way of learning it it can be

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
daunting if you're looking

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,079
at the world through someone else's

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
experience and trying to

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,240
trying to get into an industry the same

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,120
way someone else got into the industry

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
um so like folks i don't i don't i don't

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
have kids but if you had kids it would

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,160
be a different journey

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
or i don't um like there's just there's

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
there's different

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,560
constraints you have to kind of put into

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,920
it but you can still do it uh and and

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
and if you can find a way to do it and

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,959
enjoy it it's just the most beautiful

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,160
thing

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,839
so excellent so i guess

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,519
my follow-up question and i want to

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,839
transition us into talking about your

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,800
project too as well which is remar

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,000
um i know what re mirror is and i know

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
as of as like

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,560
a cms um i'm familiar with react i'm

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
familiar prose mirror but do you want to

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,279
give x

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
explanation uh the cliff notes and we

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,399
can jump in soon to actually walk

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
through the project documentation and

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,600
stuff too as well

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
yeah so documentation isn't isn't great

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,720
right now but yeah we'll

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,600
get to that yeah contributions

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
oh my god 100 welcome thank you so uh

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,480
yeah so remira

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,120
was was started as just can i do this

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
it was more of like uh i'd seen people

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
build text editors

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,360
and i was wondering how i would go about

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,800
doing it so um

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,440
yeah i i so basically what remember

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
aims to be is a universal react text

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
editor that's what it aimed to be at the

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
beginning

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
um and so you can run it in react native

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,880
you can run it

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
on react you can use it on mobile you

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,399
can use it

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
in any environment where where

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,800
javascript can be run

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
the remira american run it can do that

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,199
right now except for react native react

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,839
native i'm

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,199
hoping to maybe convince a sponsor to

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,680
give me the money to

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,720
encode that in um i was actually trying

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
to pitch my company

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
right now like hey give me give me two

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
weeks i can build it into your product

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,680
and it's not budging yet is your your

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,959
company using remir

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,000
or is this no no no really just it's

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,759
just something else

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,279
so you mentioned sponsors though what do

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,880
you i guess can you go in more details

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,240
of what you mean by sponsors like

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,959
people are actually paying you for open

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,079
source yeah yeah yeah so

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,079
uh github again

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,680
so last year i think they announced a

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,800
sponsorship

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,440
program and it just makes it that

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
you can you can show your work to the

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
world

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,600
and then ask people who feel blessed or

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
who feel like

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
your work has impacted them to maybe

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,720
give a bit back

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,160
and and it and what i found is as a

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
contributor at least

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,959
maybe it's different if you live in a

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480
different country but in the uk you have

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,800
access to a lot of things

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
and get up sponsors works well there as

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,000
a contributor it just makes it

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
a much more frictionless process of

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
asking for money because that can be

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,680
that can be hard right it's like oh hey

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
you know i i need to meet ease as well

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,160
whereas if you just have a github

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,399
sponsors button

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,199
um you can just yeah that's a better way

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
of requesting so

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,360
so what actually happened is that

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
someone reached out to me saying oh they

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,120
love the project they love a mirror

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
they'd like to use it uh how would i

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,160
like to

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,199
to you know like but there's some things

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,600
that we

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,800
need to add to make it that they can use

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
it properly

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,959
and so this was my first github sponsor

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
so i reached out to them and said hey

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,680
i'd love to do it but i didn't want to

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,720
have to go for like you know like

00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
getting

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
i don't know it was just would have been

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,440
really difficult to figure out a way of

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
invoicing them and doing all that stuff

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
it becomes really

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,880
professional and i knew i i'm working

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,039
another job i can't afford to like you

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,039
know

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,559
yeah it would have been difficult yeah

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,720
so what i what i did was just said oh

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,959
here's my github sponsors link i created

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
i created one payment amount and said if

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,240
you if you sponsor me you can either

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
sponsor me for this amount but or three

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,799
tiers actually this is this tier this

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
tea or this year

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,240
they chose the lowest one but anyway

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
they've been sponsoring me now for well

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
yeah for four months

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,320
they were my first sponsor and i'm

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,880
really grateful to them in fact

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,799
they they're the reason why i'm happy to

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
be on this podcast with you

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,720
because i was actually at the point

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
where it was almost like

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
it kind of i kind of reached the end of

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,600
where we mirrored for one person

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
could be developed um it like it was

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,240
getting to the point where it's like

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,679
okay i can't give this much more time

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,320
because

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,720
it's not viable what what sponsorship

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,400
has done

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
has allowed me to see actually there are

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,799
people who are willing to pay for this

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
and who actually see value in this being

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
in the world

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
um and even if even if a sponsorship

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,280
isn't quite

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,880
what you make in a company it still

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,080
feels really good to know that like

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
something crazy something that didn't

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
exist before

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
is like people are actually excited

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,520
enough about it

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,720
yeah someone someone's perceiving value

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
from the stuff that you're actually

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
working on i think it's a

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
yeah it's like the difference of like

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,400
joining twitter and having zero

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,880
followers

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
to compared to having 100 followers like

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
what you're putting out there people are

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
actually interacting with

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,080
and appreciating it and like they're

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
still choosing to follow you and i think

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
with github sponsors

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,360
uh it's the same thing like also like

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
you can get a star

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,960
on your repo you get a fork you need a

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
contribution but when someone perceives

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,760
value because

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
they're actually getting something out

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,720
of this sort of relationship between you

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,039
and the code

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
and um and their their product or

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,200
whatever they're working on

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
like it creates this bond and i i

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
definitely feel you on that it's also i

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,080
didn't realize that

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,919
you were at the point where um you maybe

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,120
weren't considering continuing to

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,640
contribute to to re-mirror um

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,480
i wouldn't have killed it i would have

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
killed off a project but it was just

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
you can you can if you look back at the

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
history there's like a period of like

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
four months where

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,760
the only updates are just upgrading

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,080
dependencies and that that to me is just

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,679
i'm trying to like so okay this is this

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
is just my philosophy uh at least

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
maybe it's not the same for everyone but

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,480
for me you have like there's there's

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,559
different phases of coding there's like

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
a code there's especially the project as

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
ambitious as re-mirror you it takes time

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,320
to like almost upload

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
the project into your brain so like

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
taking a month off is basically

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,280
it's almost like you you come back and

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,120
you've forgotten everything like what

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,520
was i writing what was i doing

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
so there needs to be like almost like a

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,000
continuous

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,280
uh work and if you're not if there's

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
nothing coming back it's almost like you

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
get nothing from it so i i kind of given

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
up on

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,880
being able to really make remember what

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,559
i wanted it to be

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
what the sponsorship did said allowed me

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,080
to now you basically use all the free

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
time i had

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,039
i shouldn't have maybe i maybe wasn't

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,039
healthy but i love i love working on it

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,640
so like use all the free time i had

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,480
to just just work on this and try and

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,159
make it into something that i can be

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,159
proud of something that like

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,000
that's my ambition is to build a

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,600
world-class you know editor

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,520
so i yeah i i want that yeah

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
yeah it's inspirational and like on that

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,320
note i'd love to transition

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,960
us to be able to look at your project

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,440
too as well um so i'm gonna

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
switch over to sharing my screen so you

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,360
can see it and the

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
the guest can see it as well oh there we

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,840
go

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
sharing the whole oh that's the wrong

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,640
one

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,240
yeah i should have this prepared there

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,520
we go all right so you should be able to

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
see my screen

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,640
um and everybody else should be able to

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,799
see the screen too as well

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,640
i'm also uh looks like yogi's actually

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,200
super interested in getting his hands on

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,679
contributing into re mirror and using it

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,360
um

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
i think from just hearing this i highly

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
recommend it if anybody else is

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
interested in contributing this project

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
i think this is now

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,200
the portion of the the stream that's

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,480
going to get exciting

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,600
because yeah iffy feel free to take it

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,120
away let me know

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,960
uh i'm looking at the docs right now

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,600
because i had thrown that in the chat

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,520

that and we're into those questions

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,240
so uh i've got the docs and i've got the

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
the repo itself so i see benji here yes

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,440

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,559
well every thursday actually

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,159
just to to get it to get it up and

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,120
running we've got some really exciting

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
stuff coming

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,960
in the future so okay what i'll do i'll

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
show you where the project is right now

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,200
in terms of so and then i'll tell you

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,520
about what's coming

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,559
yeah is there like a demo or an example

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
of the room

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,919
somewhere so if you go to if you go to

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,960
the docs again

00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,159
yep and then click on docs

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,280
so documentation yeah a pocket so

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,840
firstly the design is completely

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,919
changing

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,039
the docs right now are very very bad so

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,720
this is a place where

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,400
contributions are welcome the good thing

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,159
is i've been commenting all the code

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,000
so if someone is comfortable reading

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,679
comments in code it's all there

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,600
it's just i haven't yet transitioned it

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,360
to you know to this

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
to this feature so if you click on on

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
showcase if you just click on the

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,679
the carrot right next to it yeah you

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,880
can't click on it it's a bug in that

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,880
thing so if you click on the camera yeah

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
see you can click on social editor

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,559
so i mean this is very apparent if you

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
have the comments sitting and waiting

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
for someone to

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,640
or yourself or somebody else to just

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,480
take the comments

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,039
move them to this page like that sounds

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,440
like a really cool like good first issue

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,679
for someone to get their their hands

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,280
dirty and that's how this looks

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,120
so this is this is a an editor built

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,559
with remember so you can do like pretty

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,679
cool things like if you

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
you can do mention so if you start

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,799
typing apps and then make a letter oh

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,240
nice

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,480
select stuff and so i will mention

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
are these all people within the org

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
these are just like these are random

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,000
names so it's not it won't be anything

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,280
yeah okay so it's not actual real people

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
they're not gonna get a notification

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,919
somewhere

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,720
you can also do tags which is the same

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,240
as that okay

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
um it was this was basically i was

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
trying to copy the twitter editor

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,799
experience

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,720
gotcha if you do space now you can do

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,240
emoji as well so it adds a bit more than

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,039
the twitters um

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,440
nice uh where are these emojis uh coming

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,960
from so these are just native emojis

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,720
you can you can switch them out like

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
there's an option to switch them out

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
into actual

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,080
images so uh but that yeah so you can

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
actually you can either render them as

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
native or random

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,000
as images and when you render it you can

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
choose so

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
this is like the editing side of things

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,919
there's also a renderer a react renderer

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,000
for

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,279
yeah this allows you to there's a

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,279
question in the chat around

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,960
um would this be used is this

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:51,200
specifically for react projects this

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,400
um it's a great question uh

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,480
broaden oh am i saying it wrong yes

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
oh yeah anyway that's a great question

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,559
uh

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,080
so the the reason like so it this

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
version the old version which is what

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,880
we're looking at

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
was was purely for react i was like let

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,279
me build a react editor

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,880
the new version is cross framework and

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,480
what i mean by that is i've abstracted

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,360
everything out so we have a core

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,320
mirror mirror core um and i've already

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,159
built on top of

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
a dom editor so if you don't want to use

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,000
any framework you just want to be pure

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
dom

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,960
remember is for you it gives you the

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
same kind of api or just using the pure

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,120
dom

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
i've got a react editor as well the next

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
one i want to tackle is angular i

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,039
haven't i haven't used angular since

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
version one so i'm sure that's going to

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,799
be fun but

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
this again this is i i'm i'm really

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,159
targeting working on this for the next

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
six months to really get it to a place

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,360
where i feel like we can release i i'm

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
there's gonna be a release at the end of

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,000
this month

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,679
and so it'll be like a pre-release but i

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
i'd love to by the end of the year have

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,600
like

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,080
what i would say this is usable go for

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
it

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,919
yeah so that's my goal and part of that

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,240
would be to have an angular

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,120
environment perhaps explore looking at

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,600
svelte

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,320
and other frameworks but it already it's

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
already has

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,200
all the building blocks for for for that

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,120
and this is actually where because i

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,440
don't know angular and because i don't

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,200
know

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
spelt because i don't know you know

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,880
there's i'm most familiar with react

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
this is where contributions can come in

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,159
nice and so one of the things one of the

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,640
pieces of documentation i do want to

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,400
write

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,159
is how to build firstly your own

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,600
extension um

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,039
okay in fact we haven't talked about

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,279
extensions but how to build your own

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,760
functionality on top of greener

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,279
because this this this product doesn't

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,200
work unless

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
unless people um feel comfortable

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,120
contributing

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
so um i that that's the goal so if you

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,919
go to wysiwyg oh

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
uh here as well also it does because i

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
was trying to do if you go back to

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,840
social media because i was trying to

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,840
make it like a twitter thing

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
uh

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,240
i was trying to make it like a twitter

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,080
experience if you just start typing

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:56,000
http oh no just type type twitter.com

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,080
okay i lost my pizza okay excellent it's

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,279
just like it's auto linking did it so

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,360
and this stuff is kind of given to you

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,320
for free and um and

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,760
the this old version it even gets my uh

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
my pizza

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,960
tld too as well so it's pretty smart

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,360
yeah only the best

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,120
so um yeah and so if you go to wysiwyg

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,840
editor which is more of a traditional

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,880
editor

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,480
okay yeah i i like what i've just saw so

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,360
far like i already know exactly where

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,039
i'm gonna use this

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,039
in in my project uh because we were

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,400
chatting offline where i had

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,159
i haven't uh a text box but it's it's

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,760
it's pretty unfulfilling like there's

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,880
not much you can do with it um

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,480
so super excited to try that out um yeah

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,360
so this looks like the traditional like

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,960
like a wordpress or uh yeah even like if

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,480
you were using medium

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,679
so yeah exactly hello this is

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,720
brian so you can make it bold

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
it's just it's just like a typical

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
editor oh so no this one doesn't i

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
haven't added i've kind of separated

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,039
out the functionality so you could add

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
that functionality in but i i

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,279
was trying to show like different okay

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,919
but this will give me my

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,919
to-do list

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,559
i can spell eggs and if you double click

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,240
stuff it has floating menus it has like

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,679
it has um oh yeah it's very much like

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,480
your medium style editing exactly so

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,279
and all this stuff this version again it

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,039
was

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,399
it wasn't built in the best way so like

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,679
the the api wasn't

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,080
as friendly to users but the new version

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
um because uh because of just focusing

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,520
on one api focusing on hooks

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,600
for react and uh yeah

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,360
it makes it a lot easier so you can

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
literally you can create an editor by

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,279
including a hook you can just literally

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
say

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,200
to add so to go back to social editor to

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,000
add that mentions functionality you just

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,520
it says use social mentions yeah you

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
just and you write it up you obviously

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,000
you wire it up to your ui but it gives

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
you these variables

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,640
so it gives you like the currently

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,679
selected index the value of the

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,240
currently selected um

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,960
items and now you have a social editor

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,360
so it's really

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,080
um it's really it's really nice i'm

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,720
excited

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,679
i'm excited to be um introducing it at

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,760
the end of this month

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,760
yeah and uh sean's actually asking about

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,840
monaco and how it compares to monaco

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,760
uh monaco i believe monaco is another

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,799
wysiwyg editor monaco is more for coding

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,880
monaco is a is a code editor so it

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,320
it relies on on monospheric monospace

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
fonts so you kind of

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,399
you kind of uh it it has different

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,520
constraints i don't think it uses

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,840
content editable

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,279
so this because this is uh

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,399
underlyingness is using

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,840
uh prose mirror it it interacts with the

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,880
content of the editable and uses the

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,080
pros mode to manage

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
the state of the editor uh interesting

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
you should ask about

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,159
about monaco so if you go back to the

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
mirror repo

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,120
so i'm going to start talking about the

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,760
next version because yeah the old

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,240
version

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,000
isn't isn't cool enough so if we go to

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,200
go to pull requests again this is still

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,240
very early days

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
yeah and this will probably a couple of

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,159
months of building before we can

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,720
and if you scroll down to go to closed i

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,640
think okay

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,559
so oh yeah i also recently got tech so

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
you only this this week i got tests

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,760
running again so

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,840
um another oh another really cool thing

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,399
about about this project is that

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,600
right now text coverage is about 60 i

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,200
would love to get it up to 80

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,279
the tests are written in a really easy

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,960
to understand way if you want to

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,399
start contributing to the next branch by

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,760
adding tests i would love that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,520
that's one way you can contribute and

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
the great thing about writing tests is

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
that you actually gain

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
a deeper understanding of the project it

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,039
really is a good way to understand okay

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
this is how

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,880
we mirror works and any so there's a lot

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,880
of extensions i have added

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,640
okay so extensions let me just explain

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
what exchange yeah go ahead everything

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,159
functionality is added by adding an

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,760
extension so the mention

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
dimensions that were added is by adding

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,000
dimensions extension

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,000
um each each um each each piece of

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,399
functionality so bold is an extension

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,640
italic is an extension underline yeah

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,279
you get it

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
the new version adds an another

00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,919
abstraction called presets because we've

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,600
i found

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,880
that actually people didn't just want to

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,159
be you don't want to have to import like

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,919
20 different extensions

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,360
before you can get started so i've added

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,880
a preset functionality which groups

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,799
together extensions so you can say

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
formatting presets that doesn't exist

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,159
yet by the way but or

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
or list presets or table preset which

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,720
which imports

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
all of like the extensions you need to

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,080
have that functionality so that that's

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,960
something that's added in a new version

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,159
but if you if you click on um actually

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
if you just if you so if you go back to

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,279
open i

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,720
know i'm saying it's all right yeah i'm

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,720
definitely i'm feeling your excitement

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,760
uh of the project i'm excited about this

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,720
project

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,320
now if you click next yep um the next

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,200
one so it's still a drop brunch but it's

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
it's getting there

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,000
yeah i'm just going to call out that in

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,760
the comments someone found a broken link

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,880
to as well uh yogi did

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,600
um contributions welcome so if you oh

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,039
yeah yeah fix that one

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,720
oh wow yeah

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
uh so what's this next pr is this your

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,480
next version is that what the goal is

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,840
yeah so it's the next it's the next

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
version so you can see there's a lot of

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,240
work has been done

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,840
yeah that's a it's a lot of changes

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,360
like the thing is i started this as a

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,080
rewrite and i probably ended up

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,000
rewriting it

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,200
maybe like two or three times it's weird

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,240
you have like this goal okay this is

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,679
what it's going to be

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
and as you write it you realize oh this

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,360
is impossible

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,559
and then you like change it and then you

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
realize actually what's possible you

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,120
just would do it wrong and change it

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,720
back so it's been like

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,360
like that for the last maybe two months

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,640
you scroll down

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,600
so like i think there's a link there

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,600
should be a doc's link

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,840
they completely miss it

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,760
uh oh okay it might have squashed uh

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,399
the docs link okay well that's that's

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,159
that's fine

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,120
um in that case okay then go back to

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,039
closed and then

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,039
the most recent merge that would

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,960
back to pull request heading back to

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,960
closed

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,120
yeah i'm seeing the excitement in the

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,559
channel about this uh about the editor

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,320
too as well like i'm just blown away at

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,600
the social editor of something

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,200
i've never had the opportunity to build

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,000
something like that so like i i know

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,960
they exist

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,640
and then i kind of know how it works but

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,320
to have you already go through like the

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
the struggle of making it work i'm like

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,840
oh cool let me just take this down there

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
i happen to already be a sponsor of you

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,399
so like i will support the work

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,919
um and uh i hope everybody else jumps on

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,000
board too as well contributions and

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,880
sponsorships so which uh closed pr are

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,320
we looking for

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
so first if you click the first one it's

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,640
just the most recent so

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,760
in this version um so in the old version

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,519
i was using emotion

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,880
in this version i've changed to using

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,480
linario because

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,159
people don't want to have to import

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,840
emotion lunaria basically

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,360
it extracts the styles from it so you

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,159
kind of use it like emotion but

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,080
the styles so this is for your css and

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,960
javascript is that

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,600
uh yeah yes yes so like this yeah um

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,600
yeah

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,799
anyway so if you so some of some of the

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,279
stuff doesn't work on this so don't try

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,200
and

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,880
go into the mentions of this the style's

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,320
completely broken but if you click on

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
this i'll show you like

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,519
the reason i was going to show you about

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
this was because

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,000
someone mentioned monaco and we're

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,600
actually using monaco in this new

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,600
version so if you click on playground

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,159
it will take a while because we still

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,000
haven't got stuff in what we're doing

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,600
we're building a way for people to very

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
quickly get started with remember

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,120
so what you can do this again the styles

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,880
are all broken it looks it doesn't look

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,080
like much you can actually select the

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,360
extensions you want to use so if you

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,559
click auto link select

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,080
extension and then base key map so it

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,640
automatically starts building like

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
the editor for you oh yeah so you can't

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,039
see it right now because there's no

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,440
styling but if you click just underneath

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,120
uh in that gray panel the gray panel

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,279
below but

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,200
towards the top i know it's hard to just

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,919
do it yeah

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,320
and you can start typing okay um so like

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
uh

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,320
auto linking there we go yeah so you can

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,760
see all that stuff working

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,240
now if you go if you click like bold

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,599
extension and then italic extension

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,119
uh italic so the goal this this is

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,359
basically going to be a way

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,879
um uh we're adding so this has been

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,800
driven a lot by by benji

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,040
i think he learned a lot about this from

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,040
graphql and liam monaco integration

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,639
yeah i think uh nikki was talking about

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,240
yeah ricky yeah ricky was

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
literally the last the last open source

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,960
fighter we did and he talked through his

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,320
monaco and his

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
broken styles as well yeah yeah so um so

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,280
yeah you can and

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,399
it's really cool so like it's literally

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,079
a way to

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,760
raise bugs if someone notices a bug in

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,320
one of the extensions um this is going

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
to be a way

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,200
similar to how typescript playground

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,079
works or babble playground works you'll

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,520
just send us the link

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,520
the link will be a permalink and you can

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,320
fix those issues it's a way to get

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,079
started you're going to be able to

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,440
export it to your own package and you

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,480
have immediately have an editor that

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,480
works for you

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
um so so this is this is kind of the

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,280
future of how editors

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
at least will be started you may

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
obviously customize it but you can see

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,520
that

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
it kind of gives you all the stuff that

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,160
you need and you can see like how an

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
editor will look obviously the styles

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,280
are really basic right now

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,320
yeah but uh but if i were to take this

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,880
and like

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,960
granted i install remember on my project

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,839
uh i can copy and paste this into my own

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,160
project and it's working right off the

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,440
bat exactly

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,480
that's amazing um i'm curious this also

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,280
have the social

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,240
plugins here or is this only for the uh

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,400
it will but you won't

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,160
like because this um again we we're

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,680
still thinking about how to

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
so one of the things with the tooling

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,640
around the rear mirror is going to have

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,599
to like improve so

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,880
firstly the the making writing

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,520
extensions

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,400
is isn't isn't hard but i i'm i think

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,920
i'm a bit lazy

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,680
i like things being as easy as possible

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,079
so one of the things i'm working on is

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,560
it's a

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,160
is an eslint rule for re-mirror so

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,960
extensions are kind of like autocomplete

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,240
for you so

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,920
uh we have there's a concept there's

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
like there's there's things that can

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,000
change when the

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,440
editor starts and it's things that

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
should never change so there's certain

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,480
options you can pass in

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,079
right now you have to declare this is

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,599
static and this is not static

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,520
but what we want what the lint roll will

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,280
do is basically auto infer

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,040
what's starting on what's not and like

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,160
do that for you there's there's like a

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,160
lot of things that will just kind of

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,760
automate for you and also feel for you

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,440
the second thing we want to add to

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,680
integrate with this playground

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,720
is a is a meta plug-in so the meta

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,480
plug-in will

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,560
add like i'm sorry a battle plug-in that

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
adds metadata to each extension

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,520
so what that would do is if you click

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,880
now if you scroll down and see the

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,839
mention extension

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,839
um

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,599
these are the things that we haven't yet

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,280
we've been working on really big

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,720
screens before but we didn't test that

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,720
out so apologies um

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,760
if i can i just see him out

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,520
okay my back yeah it doesn't have over

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,520
scroll either

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,560
it might be a little challenging to

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,400
get this to work yeah oh here we go

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,760
don't worry about it

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,280
again it doesn't do anything right now

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
but what we want is that if if that

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
bubble plug-in is used to build it

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,240
yeah then it will tell you all the stuff

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,680
that's available on it so it can

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,839
automatically build

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
the functionality into this editor so we

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,079
really want to make the playground

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
a first class citizen of re mirror and

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,320
um

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,400
allow you to experiment with stuff

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,079
without having to you know

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,920
spin up your own environment or do all

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,160
of this difficult stuff

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,599
um so yeah that's that's that's pretty

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,880
cool that's in the works

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,720
and if you go back to the project

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
yeah yeah yeah that's i mean

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,520
hats off to you to have so much uh i

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,040
know benji's been helping you have some

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,720
contributions but

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
that was like that's a i think i got a

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,320
good grasp of the project

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,160
um it looks like we're gonna have like a

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,680
nice little nice uh area for

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,839
if i have an idea i wanna sort of

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,720
playground it out copy and paste it into

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,240
my project

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,760
it works um so yeah i honestly i think

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,280
this might be something i want to work

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,040
on in my next release

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,200
uh the release after the next one from

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,960
my project uh because like i mentioned

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,760
that we have um

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,720
we have a chat box uh not a chat box we

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,599
have a note-taking

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,200
section on my my project which i'll show

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,599
you in a sec i'll show the listeners

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,640
because

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,839
i showed you but um so if i go into

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,640
a project and i want to write notes on a

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,839
project

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,040
this box down here is uninspiring

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,760
um and i'd love to have that social

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,880
um example literally just be the same

00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,520
thing so if i

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,040
type in pizza that would be amazing if i

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,680
could just have pizza to show up

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,839
um so i you have you have one more user

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
of remira for sure and like oh awesome

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,960
yeah definitely

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,920
i will give you i will upstream some

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,960
some fixes to

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,280
as i find them i also just want to give

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
a

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,960
quick shout out to uh prose mirror too

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
as well because um persimmer is a i

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,800
guess the underlying technology on top

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,839
or beneath your remitter is that correct

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,880
yes yeah yeah 100 position okay so like

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,839
what's the difference between pros

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,560
mirror and then remember

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,160
it's like remarriage is basically has a

00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,440
little i guess the social thing is one

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,440
of the things

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,280
yeah so so pros prosmer is like it's

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,520
like

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,560
i don't know what to say yeah drives the

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,920
interaction with

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,440
the content editable gotcha so so we are

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,480
using the prosmart apis

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,000
to do a lot of the work and um

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,920
but the problem like not the problem but

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,720
the thing about prosumer is that

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,160
it it's not it's like it it makes the

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,480
content editable work so if you try and

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,000
just

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,440
work with content editors on your own

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
you're gonna have a lot of problems

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,920
because

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,599
it's a very broken implementation it

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,359
wasn't it wasn't built

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,560
it was built in bits and pieces without

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,079
really thinking about how the whole

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
thing could be cohesive

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,839
rosemary is kind of built to solve a lot

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,320
of the problems that content editable

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,680
has

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,200
and it does so really well obviously

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,320
there are sometimes browser things that

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
have come up and

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,119
and the maintainer i don't want to

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
pronounce his name wrong so i won't say

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,000
it

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,200
but he's a really smart guy really

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,640
really smart person like

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,320
shout out to him we're really grateful

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,680
for him building something so

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,599
beautiful but but he's uh he like

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,680
he yeah he's he's a very good maintainer

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,160
so but the problem i found with prosmart

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,079
is that

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,680
it can there's a lot of moving pieces so

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,040
you have to think of schema

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,680
nodes marks everything is granular

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,079
like something is like so the next the

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
next

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,119
phase of the development of right now

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,359
i'm working on like

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,480
the external api so yeah i want to give

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
you stuff for free like mention this

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,119
extension but there's going to come a

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,319
time where you want to say for example

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,680
say oh i want to

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,680
have it when the person clicks this

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,839
button it makes this uppercase

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,880
or it makes this part lowercase that's

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,760
actually really hard to do with pros

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,839
mirror you have to like

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,359
you have to almost have a phd because

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,400
you have to say okay this is a node this

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,920
is a mark okay

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
find where the position of that node is

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,319
that is it and there's so many things

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
that you have to do so

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,079
like the abstraction level is very and

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
just to those who don't understand what

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,119
i mean but

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,880
you have to think about every step what

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,920
i want remember to do is just take what

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,079
prosma is doing

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,920
and then like package it in a way that

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,359
it's like i want to do this

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,680
and there's just one command for doing

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,599
it so remember it is like

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,599
it's like it joined it allows you to use

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,480
prisma under the hood to get that great

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,480
browser support

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,760
yeah on top of it it adds support for

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,200
react it adds support for

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,680
angular in the future adds direct

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,760
support for the dom but in a way that

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,200
you know that you can like enjoy so

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,520
that's the goal

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,800
excellent um so going back to remember i

00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,960
wanted to transition us to

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,319
like we had a lot of like callouts for

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,400
good contributions i think

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,560
yg uh yg dev which is yogi um

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,000
he is definitely going to be um jumping

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,200
into your your contributions

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
i'm curious if anybody else has any

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,920
other questions around how to contribute

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,160
to project but

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
uh i know this is your you've really

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,800
started kicking up the pace for this

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,800
project but like

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
how could someone contribute today could

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,880
you walk us through that

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,839
uh i did see the edit um on the docs

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
itself

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,000
actually what's uh do we lose it oh

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,599
there we go uh i did notice that there's

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,440
the edit on github

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,280
as well that may not work anymore it may

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,599
not work master branch

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,520
i don't know oh it does okay cool uh

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,720
yeah yeah yeah cool so we need to fork

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
this

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,160
yeah so if you if you want to start with

00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,560
the docs

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,440
yeah can you talk through how i can find

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,200
um

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,440
i think that's a really good low effort

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,800
thing to do um if you have the code

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,079
could you give an example of like where

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,280
you have the comments in the code do you

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
have like a file in mind

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,280
oh yeah sure so if you go to yeah

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,839
actually go to app remira

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,839
and then call

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,079
then go to source so everything is tight

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,680
this is a typescript project

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,760
so okay i'll talk about some of the four

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,200
goals in the rewrite yeah

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,680
one one of the things is that this is

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,160
going to be a typescript native project

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,119
what that means to me is that i want the

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,200
code to guide you

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,880
to tell you what to do yeah so when you

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,599
add an extension to your editor

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,280
it should immediately update like the

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,640
type should immediately reflect

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,920
all the new commands that are available

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,880
so if you add the bold extension it

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,960
should immediately

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,400
allow you to run toggle bold you don't

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,599
have to look at documentation the

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
documentation is in

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,960
is in line so that's one of the goals of

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,680
the mirror and it's actually a joyful

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,319
experience

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,079
um so uh for example with uh like the

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,720
dimension extension what one thing it

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,599
exposes

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,359
is i have this use extension hook it for

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,319
reacting so you can say use extension

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,280
mention extension and the next parameter

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,280
automatically fills

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,480
all the handlers that are on use

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,200
extensions you can literally just say

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,839
use extension

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,400
um whatever add on change handler and it

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,680
knows

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,760
it knows it has this unchanged handler

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,680
it knows it has an on exit handler it

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,800
knows all of the stuff that's available

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,560
for that extension because the

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,079
typescript support is first class so

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,280
that was one of the first things second

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,520
was universal editor

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,040
i'm still i still want to get this in i

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,920
i know exactly how i would build a

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,839
webview

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,359
uh implementation of this so it supports

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,400
react native it supports

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,480
uh what's that one

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,040
okay it's a box flutter supports any

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,640
implementation yeah um

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,359
any it can work it can live inside a

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,839
webview and then expose bindings

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,480
to the native layer so the edit is just

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,640
webview

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,240
which is cool and then you just you you

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,760
issue commands into it using like the

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,960
native ui

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,240
so that's something i really would love

00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,119
to do so if anyone wants to sponsor me

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,040
to do that

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,760
you know what to do but anyway if we go

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,760
into extension

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,400
and then extension base

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,400
so okay this way i don't know if this is

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,520
the best one

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,520
yeah so you can see like uh

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,400
some of them this is quite dry if you

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,760
scroll down if you've got like if you go

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,800
to like extensions of fundamentals to

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,200
the way the email works with

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,200
them together whatever and so there's

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,760
there tends to be examples

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,839
i try and i try and put in examples i

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,160
try and

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:43,280
uh like

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:47,200
make it readable if if you

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,560
so the majority

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,400
the majority of the core code is

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,319
commented like this because

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,160
it's been such a big like push to get

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,400
this new version out

00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,920
i what one thing in the new version is

00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
that extensions all have your own

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
package

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,160
so you have extension for bold extension

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,920
if you're italic and in that drive

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,760
there's things that aren't commented as

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,680
well and so this

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,680
but a lot of it if you understand like

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,640
the core you can probably infer what

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,400
stuff is doing

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,200
so i would love to have people write

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,480
documentation on the bold extension just

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,760
and the thing about the thing about

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,359
comments and documentation it doesn't

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,920
have to be that rich it can just be

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,720
this is a bold extension weirdly i

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
actually feel like

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,079
code commenting is good even if a

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
comment says i have no idea what's

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,079
happening

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,319
it just gives the person reading the

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,160
code like oh okay cool i i feel better

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,400
yeah yeah i don't know what's happening

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,480
either yeah exactly

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,240
sometimes a code comment isn't just

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,599
isn't just to express my knowledge

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,880
sometimes it's to express my lack of

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,480
knowledge or to say hey

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,920
if you if you know a better way please

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,800
change i this is something i rush

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,560
together

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,280
and so that that's that's so i've tried

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,640
as much as i can um to to make sure that

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,040
commenting in the code base is really

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,560
cool there there is something i do wanna

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,640
i do wanna highlight so one of the

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,160
another thing another goal so there were

00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
like four goals i had with the new

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,760
version and then

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,960
hopefully i'm achieving them uh one of

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,599
the goals was to make

00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,240
remir extensible so initi in the old

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,000
version

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,440
you had like you have what you call a

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,280
mirror manager yeah

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,560
and the manager it manages like so you

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,839
have

00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,440
so there's like four levels so you have

00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,160
extensions which add functionality to

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
the editor

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,440
then you have like react which is your

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,280
view layer and in the middle it's

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,119
the manager the manager takes all the

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,400
extensions and then

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,280
is used by re by the like the react view

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,240
layer

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,640
integration to like to to to send stuff

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,280
to

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,880
prose mirror so the manager's like it

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,160
actually i don't have a diagram sorry

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,280
yeah don't worry so what what what the

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,280
manager

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,640
uh what i wanted is i wanted people to

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
be able to add like

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,480
their own custom functionality to the

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,960
manager so what i've done in this new

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,119
version

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,960
is that everything that was once native

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,960
to the manager is now just an extension

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
so the extensions power even like the

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,160
core functionality so

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,079
one of the core things about pros mirror

00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,040
is the schema you you create a schema to

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,680
say okay

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,800
i i'm gonna have this this this editor

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,760
will support bold

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,160
italic you so your schema declares the

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,400
functionality that's supported

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,760
but even even the schema now is being

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,280
generated by an extension

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,040
and the way it does that if you scroll

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,599
down or if you search search for

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,599
oncreate

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,640
okay so this is the interface with

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,920
extension life cycle methods that means

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,040
every extension has access to these

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,160
lifecycle methods

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,520
you keep scrolling um so oncreate is

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,760
called right at the beginning

00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,280
um so this is like like when the manager

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,559
first starts up it calls every

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,720
extensions on create

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,920
then on view on view happens when like

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,079
so the view like

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,200
the view uh pros mirror has a view yeah

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,800
that is sent through

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,559
so this is like this is called when when

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,400
like when the view is available

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,000
then on state update that's called every

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,720
time the prosmar estate

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,319
updates and on destroy is called when uh

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,200
but by just just by having these life

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,319
cycle methods

00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,400
you literally allow yourself to the the

00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,079
code base becomes like infinitely um

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,440
customizable that's not a great thing i

00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,319
mean infinite customizability is

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,000
basically

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,359
all code is infinitely customizable so

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,599
yeah what i've tried to do

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,760
is make it customizable but in an

00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,920
understandable way yeah

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,800
i just wanted to call out uh yogi had

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,240
mentioned he had a

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,319
quick question about react native and

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,079
support uh you mentioned earlier but do

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,280
you want to mention that again uh

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,559
does re mirror support react native so

00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,240
remember

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,160
the core goal is for it to be universal

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,400
so i know how i would build

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,319
support for react native into it um and

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,599
this is one of the goals of this version

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,200
i i've talked to i've mentioned to my

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,920
company about giving me maybe a couple

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,839
of weeks

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,760
to integrate reamer into our project and

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,520
in doing so because it's a reactivated

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,520
project in doing so i would have

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,280
that functionality um by default in

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,720
uh i haven't yet heard anything back so

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,400
so it's something i'm really pitching

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,640
for because i know

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,760
it's in my head i know what to do but it

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,760
still takes that like

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,440
time it's like a month of work maybe

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,680
yeah when i say what probably means even

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,680
more

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,960
but it's something i really really want

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,800
to do if if we mirror

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,240
if people are doctoring mirror enough if

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,119
companies say that they're interested in

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,040
using this

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,800
if it's something that people really

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,440
want to succeed then i don't see a

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,880
reason why

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,480
it's not in the code base within the

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,040
next two three months

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,559
that's that's um that's the goal yeah

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,440
just just know that that's what i want i

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,960
don't want

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,559
again i think it's a lazy part of me i

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,839
don't want to have to have an editor

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,920
that works on the web and i have to do

00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:31,280
something different for my my app i want

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,880
to have the same code

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,720
being used and there's so many cool

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,280
ideas okay let me let me ramble so

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,359
there's

00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,640
so for for the the way it would work

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,079
i'll give you like the breakdown how

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,160
would work on react native

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,359
is that you would you would basically it

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,960
have the same

00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,720
editor but you just would remove all the

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,400
ui around

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,000
like sort of you know buttons and stuff

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,200
in the web view yeah so that would just

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
paste it and then there'll be a bridge

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,760
that communicates across

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,440
so when a command is when something

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,079
happens in the webview it communicates

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,359
saying okay

00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,640
this is happening to the react native

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,040
layer when something happens in the

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,760
react native layer it communicates back

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,760
to the to the web view and so that's the

00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,520
kind of um

00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,200
directionality but the cool thing is

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,119
that because

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,480
you're in a sense building a webview

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,800
what you need

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,040
is what i started like drafting up just

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,480
in my spare time is like a babble macro

00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,160
so it would you would basically just

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,559
like import your code as normal

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,359
and the macro would transform that code

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,359
that's meant to be

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,800
running a webview into a string html

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,359
string that just inserts itself into

00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,000
your react native website

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,720
so like like those things excite me but

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,119
it's like

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,240
i i can't start it because i know

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,520
starting it

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,599
i'm not finishing it sometimes it's

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,240
worse than not starting it so yeah it's

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,000
just about

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,920
trying to find a way to do it how do you

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
approach that like so you have thought

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,440
through

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,200
how to build this so how do you approach

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,079
do you write up like rfcs or do you

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,520
write up like

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,440
do you write this down so that way if

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,960
anybody else has bandwidth they can do

00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,000
it or are you not at that point in the

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,440
project

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,520
that's a good idea i have i've written

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,440
down some notes on that i haven't like

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,520
um that's no i don't so i

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,280
to be fair the rf the whole rrc process

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,559
uh i've never

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,599
really used it and i would love to i i

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,160
don't know why i haven't used that i

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,359
think i haven't used it because actually

00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,119
i've looked at projects that use it and

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,839
i i actually find it quite hard to use

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,000
because

00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,440
you don't it's like it's a fork of a

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,880
project so it's hard to

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,319
know where the rfc exists unless you

00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,599
have the direct link to it at least in

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,200
the implementations i've seen

00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:34,800
i might have a solution for you yep um

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,800
so let me see if uh vercell has one open

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,119
so um we have this new feature at github

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,640
which is the discussions

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,160
and the good thing about this is like

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,400
normally rfcs have to live in another

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,680
repo and it's a whole other experience

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,040
uh but if i look for rfc for versailles

00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,720
or for next uh you can see they now have

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,839
a discussion

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,960
and then you outline your approach as

00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:02,079
like a blog post and markdown

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,520
and then you get your comments

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,000
nice and they're also the cool thing

00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,400
about this too as well is that they're

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,160
um if you wanted to they're threaded so

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,640
this sounds

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,280
like a way i don't know like a thing to

00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,880
do

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
and i can enter i won't do this now

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,520
because i i have no idea what this

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,359
person's saying but i can thread

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,200
my comment based on this this piece of

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,119
feedback so instead of you're now you're

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,559
in a repo with a bunch of issues

00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,880
like this is the previous way people

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,240
were doing it or you have a wiki or

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,000
you're in a whole nother platform like

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,559
you're in google docs like

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,680
now you can have your rccs directly in

00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,760
the discussion

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,520
as well so this is a beta feature i'm

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,559
happy to get you access to this as well

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,240
it is beta

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,599
um but if you wanted to write your

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,480
thoughts out i'm sure everybody on the

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,559
call who's

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,640
super interested in seeing the next step

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,760
like uh yogi's very i know yogi does

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,640
react native as well

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,839
for his job um they can provide feedback

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,880
on how they would see this and how to

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,520
implement it so like your

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,040
your approach to babel macro um like

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,720
perhaps someone could be like hey

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,319
i prototyped your macro for you here it

00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,160
is or hey

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:05,440
i'm going to prototype this in my react

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,079
project because i have a branch and we

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,440
have some

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,359
we have an engineering cycle where we

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,200
can actually work on this because we're

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,319
we're down a sprint or we have a we have

00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,760
a dead sprint where we don't have

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,079
anything

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,680
yeah that that's actually really i think

00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,040
this is this is where i feel i need to

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,960
learn a lot in open source

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,559
one of one of the things i've really

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,760
been like

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,359
has really helped me is just working

00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,520
with benji so he's he's been in open

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,400
source for a long time and years and

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,680
years

00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,880
and i i i feel like initially i've

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,119
always kind of been

00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,400
not like there's a tendency to be like a

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,079
lone ranger you know i

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,760
like do things alone but open source

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,920
doesn't really work like that and

00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,760
and just working with benji just

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,760
discussing things gets

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,119
gets ideas to be much much better yeah

00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,839
so what i've

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,040
what i've found is that you know i'm

00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,559
going to adopt this thank you so much

00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,240
for the suggestion

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,520
and i i just wanted to bring this up at

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,720
one point too as well like the fact that

00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,079
benji is actually

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,680
showing you how to accomplish um

00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
like the next steps or how to organize

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,760
your project and stuff like that

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,800
uh i'm a big fan of like the idea of

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,880
mentorship

00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,079
um where you get mentorship from like

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,280
people telling you like hey

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,839
maybe you should organize your project

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,800
this way like let's create some packages

00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,720
and then there's like this other thing

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,760
which is sponsorship too as well and

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,119
like i'm looking at your

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
sponsorship page here so there's a lot

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,480
of familiar faces including myself

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,520
here um thank you yes i'm super happy

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,800
i'm super happy to actually learn about

00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,240
your project too because i'm like i'm

00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,920
all in and i think the difference

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,520
between sponsorship and mentorship

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,839
is like these individuals here are

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,119
invested in the future of this project

00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,040
in the future of you

00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,799
and uh i think it's a big deal to

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,280
actually put yourself out there and say

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:44,160
i am invested in the future growth

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,920
of iffy and his project uh and like i'm

00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,280
happy to like things like discussions

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,880
getting that involved in your product

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,880
project so you can get rfcs like i'm

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,799
invested in the future of this project

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,079
even without using it because i i'm

00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,119
excited and i hope uh

00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,040
everybody else who's expressed

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,559
excitement whether it's sponsorship

00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,119
through money or sponsorship through

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,319
time

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,119
or just contribution um

00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,160
big fan of that also okay the coolest

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,760
thing let me show you the cool thing

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,799
about this product if you scroll down

00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,960
did it read me yep

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:20,720
oh no okay can you do a hard refresh do

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:23,200
a hard refresh

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,319
it's cool let's scroll up a bit yeah

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,040
yeah cool this is the coolest thing

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,520
about the project

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,400
the logo is animated when it comes up i

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,480
was like

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,880
that's that's all you need to know

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,280
anyway is this a gif

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,440
no it says svg so i didn't know i've

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,480
supported css animations but it does and

00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,799
i'm i'm gonna make the most survive

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,000
that's honestly that's news to me sorry

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,160
i need to find your readme because i

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,359
need to see how you did this

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,400
if you go to uh i think the file is in

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,400
support assets

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,359
you are you want to see

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,319
i had it in the last version as well but

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,799
it was like a really tame animation and

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,359
people

00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:05,359
never didn't notice it but yeah so

00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,720
i don't think it's going to render in

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,640
the svg

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,319
if you look at rule yeah okay

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,400
excellent i literally right over there

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,240
i've got these svg animation book from

00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,520
sarah drazner like this is like the next

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,599
thing i'm going to be working on is

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,040
actually learning how to do animations

00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,319
and svgs

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,079
i don't know how to do that i just know

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,280
i knew enough css to

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,680
to kind of get i mean if that's what it

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,880
is i i know css too as well for some

00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,920
reason i thought it was a little more

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,799
complicated than that um yeah that's

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,559
that's pretty awesome

00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,760
like this is all for me personally this

00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,280
is understandable i don't know if this

00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,640
is unattainable for other people

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,920
but um you're here and i'm sure people

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,359
can reach out to you i just pulled up

00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,079
your profile too as well

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,880
so if you aren't already following um

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,680
iffy on

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,960
github uh definitely check it out um

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,280
yeah

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,559
i think there is a individual and

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,720
organization

00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,559
oh sorry i'm like trying to follow the

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,480
chat how do you get sponsorship is it

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,839
project based or individuals yes

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,680
so they're already answering the

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,040
conversation but yeah github sponsors

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,480
you have to apply for it

00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,880
it's not available in every country

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,000
we're actually get up sponsors

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,440
is available in 32 regions um

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,680
i'm not sure if what the difference

00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,359
between a region in the country is but

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,280
uh perhaps yeah north

00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,799
north america is a region i'm not sure

00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,440
what the difference is but

00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,480
32 regions available sign up to join the

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,040
waitlist

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,400
what they do is this approve that you're

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,720
a viable candidate that you have

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,839
contributions or you have projects

00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:40,000
i'm not sure exactly what the minimum

00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,400
the minimum needed to be in sponsors but

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
definitely highly recommend anybody who

00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,599
wants to get an opportunity to get

00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,160
funded for their open source or

00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,599
have investment um check it there and

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,359
then it is project based but there's

00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,240
only very few projects who are on

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,359
sponsors

00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,760
so you can also submit um to join

00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,799
the waitlist for your project so these

00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,079
are my projects

00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,559
so if i wanted to i could get open

00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,040
source

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:08,240
sponsored i have no 501 3c as well

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,920
i was going to do that for reamer and

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,079
then i saw i'm like yeah i don't i don't

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,920
know how to

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,839
just left it yeah i don't think that's a

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,760
hard requirement i think it's easier

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,520
if you are a non-profit um that's what

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,240
the 501 3c if you're not in the us

00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,640
if no one knew what that was um but i

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,000
think

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,920
you're still able to get sponsorship

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,240
there's also a way to get sponsorship

00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,520
through other platforms like patreon or

00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,839
our collective

00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,280
uh not our collective open collective um

00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:35,680
where you can just provide that link

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,280
in your repo so if you do already get

00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,119
sponsorship other places

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,400
uh you can just drop it in there uh

00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,400
through the sponsorship feature

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,359
oh exciting excellent uh yeah i

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,720
recommend anyone to

00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,880
get them get involved in open source

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,680
it's such a it's transformational you

00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,640
learn so much

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,240
and um i think i forgot to mention like

00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,760
we got i got carried away every mirror

00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:00,319
stuff and i know you i know it's

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,680
my time is almost up yeah we got roughly

00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,200
ten minutes

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,559
okay let me just summarize how uh so

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,640
like the first i think the first time i

00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,720
seriously started contributing was to

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,440
because i started using typescript and

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,119
at that time so this is maybe 2007 end

00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,680
of 2017

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,640
at that time a lot of projects didn't

00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,559
have types

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,680
for them and there's a project called

00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,160
definitely typed

00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,119
which is which is like where you can add

00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,480
types to

00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:30,400
third-party npm packages and

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,079
uh so those are my photos because like

00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,760
it was weird i needed them

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,440
and then i'd write them oh let me just

00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,119
contribute these back to

00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,799
the community so those are my first uh

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,440
contributions okay

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,079
maybe up to 30 packages i don't know i'm

00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,000
assuming

00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,920
that i i typed up so it's not like an

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,599
amazing amount but for me it was it was

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,240
like the significant first debut

00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:51,119
i got used to the process of of doing

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,119
stuff so

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,200
if you're like i think with open source

00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,599
contributions there's a lot to learn

00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,040
like not in an intimidating way but

00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,440
sometimes you want to focus on one thing

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,240
so

00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,520
maybe there's a doc a project that needs

01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,480
documentation that's a really good way

01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,480
to start because

01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,920
you get to learn like the git process or

01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,359
you learn you just get to learn like the

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,960
whole process around like submitting

01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,359
something getting it approved talking to

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,880
the

01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,160
contributor to the owner or maintainer

01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,720
that's what you call them

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,000
and having it approved so um it's nice

01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,119
like

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,720
maybe you don't start if you haven't

01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,319
done it before maybe don't start with

01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,119
tensorflow contributions but you can i

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,040
don't know

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,720
you can you might have the expertise uh

01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,680
but you just never actually approach

01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,200
the problem or approach contributing

01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,000
yeah so if someone wants to contribute

01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,400
to your project i

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
we got we started the docs and we showed

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,880
like where the docs live and how the

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,799
the comments exist um we didn't actually

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,400
do a proper tour through the project too

01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,040
as well but it seems like

01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,760
the majority of the code is in the remir

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,599
folder

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,200
yeah so this there's two everything

01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,119
that's like um so

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,599
i the projects have published is at

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,680
remira forward slash

01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,640
name so extension speaking of extension

01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,319
editors

01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,880
editor presets is that all documented

01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,480
somewhere

01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,640
or do you have a contributing md or

01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,319
something yeah there's a contribution

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,799
oh i think it's in docs so if you go to

01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:13,119
docs then contributing md

01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,240
it's it's not it's not great but it's

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,359
not terrible so

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,960
um yeah and i think the best

01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,559
the best time to update you're

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,319
contributing to md is when someone

01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,799
contributes to the project

01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,160
um so if there's something that's not

01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,680
outlined here

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,680
uh anybody who wants to contribute to

01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,119
the docs or contribute to the extensions

01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,680
or whatnot or the next

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,960
version of this um it's like a perfect

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,960
time to actually

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,280
uh jump at this i'm curious what's this

01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,079
uh pm pm

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,559
okay so i my old version was using yarn

01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,839
um

01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,079
and i've just been experimenting with

01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,480
different package managers and i've i've

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,160
really settled on pmpm i've kind of like

01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,760
there's a few things that yarn has that

01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,240
are maybe

01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,880
more developer friendly but it's it's

01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,599
really

01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,960
really really good so so many bugs i

01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,640
highlighted so many bugs because one

01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,200
thing that yarn does in a workspace it

01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,599
hoists

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,720
every package to the top so if you don't

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,520
have the right package in your

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,960
in your sub package it thinks you do so

01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,640
you you push up something and then you

01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,640
people it breaks everyone's machine and

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:16,000
you this is all broken whereas pmpm

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,680
it co-locates the package in the in

01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,480
in the correct directory which is really

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,280
cool it's also really quick

01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,480
and it's it's uh it's it's actually

01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,760
being you i actually learned about it

01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,400
from microsoft um

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,280
the rushed stack repo so they recommend

01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,520
it as like

01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,400
it's the only package manager according

01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,880
to rushtag

01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,640
that doesn't have transient dependencies

01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,319
i don't really know what that means

01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,559
but they made it sound like a really bad

01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:43,280
thing so it's it's very

01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,960
reproducible the the one the one issue

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,480
you may have with pnpm

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,079
if you want to use a react native

01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,720
project it

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,400
it's actually not the form of pmpm pmpm

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,520
it's weird saying that so many times

01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,440
it relies on it relies on sim links so

01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,200
using sim links to

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,480
oh yeah that's one of the things as well

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,000
it only installs your

01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,520
package once so even if you install it

01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,599
in multiple products on your machine

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,960
it's all installed once in one place on

01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,960
your machine so

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,319
i i always have to clean my node models

01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,920
and i save like 10 gigabytes 20

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,440
gigabytes every few months

01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,280
with pmpm you don't need to do that

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,400
because these packages only it's only

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,960
installed one time

01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,480
which is really cool um but the the

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,400
react native rel doesn't

01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,160
support simulinks so if you're using

01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,119
pmpm you may struggle with react native

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,319
the way around that

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:30,240
i've found is to use the the whole

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,680
anyway this is going into the details

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,400
yeah i mean it's all fascinating because

01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,480
i

01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,240
never even i've heard of pmpm but i've

01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,720
never taken a look at it to even

01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,680
understand it it's really because i

01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,920
tried i

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,280
upgraded to yarn too and yarns had some

01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,480
really good ideas

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,480
but i don't know it just didn't feel

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,119
polished whereas pmpm about polish and

01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,039
also i like

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,480
upgrade policy of pmpm so yarn two is

01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,880
like a very hard breaking change

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,520
from beyond one npm has just recently

01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,680
had a big release from four to five

01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,799
and i just upgraded and everything still

01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,280
worked so i

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,319
i like that kind of um it's more it's

01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,920
more incremental

01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,680
which is really cool okay um

01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,280
but yeah i think we're sort of like

01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,839
basically moving into the next section

01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,440
that i'd

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,039
like to talk about so i highly recommend

01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,079
anybody who's interested and

01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,319
more about remir check out the the repo

01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:19,920
ask questions uh what's the best place

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,400
to ask questions about the project like

01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,680
do you just take them all on the issues

01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,280
yeah just just post the question

01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,720
initially i'm not i'm not precious about

01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,640
issues and if obviously if

01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,920
you get invited into discussions then

01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,200
the discussions yeah

01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,319
i'll get you hooked up with discussions

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,839
so that way you can we can have

01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,760
questions out of the discussions and

01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,200
then you can upload them it's a it's a

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,960
wonderful product

01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,319
or a feature rather github's a product

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,119
and uh this feature

01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:45,280
is discussions um so i've been i always

01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,480
round up these conversations with uh and

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,000
i'm curious to actually

01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,000
i do have one question so if anybody has

01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,920
any more questions feel free to

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,200
ask them but is it best to look for

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,839
projects to and this is

01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,680
in regards to contributing um it's best

01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,760
to look for projects to join in

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,960
languages you're fluent in or maybe just

01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,960
something you've always wanted to learn

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,000
i i i think it just depends on your

01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,039
personality i

01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,920
think i'm maybe more of an introvert so

01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,359
i prefer language that i'm already

01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,559
flowing in because i like doing my

01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:19,359
learning quietly

01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,400
and then displaying it in public but

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,559
someone else may

01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,920
need that engagement to learn quicker so

01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,160
for them it would be

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,160
it would make sense to to do it like to

01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,200
learn in public basically yeah i would i

01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,799
would talk about that because i'd be

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,440
like oh am i doing it wrong and

01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,079
constantly

01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,280
questioning myself yeah so i guess it

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,400
really just comes down to how do you

01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,559
like to learn

01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,440
so if you're fine with sort of brute

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,440
force

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,599
or even this like absorbing new

01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,359
knowledge uh with contra concrete

01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,480
examples so like it happened you

01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:51,680
might not know javascript or react or um

01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,280
how babble macros work like

01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,720
jumping into that full force and just

01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,720
learning it as you go along

01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,839
like kind of mirrors like how we kind of

01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,920
have to learn and

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,200
on the job so if someone gives you a php

01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
problem

01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,520
like either you have to learn it or you

01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,240
have to pass it on to somebody else on

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,960
the team

01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,000
um i personally uh to answer that

01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,880
question

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,160
i actually i use a lot of contributions

01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,799
i don't usually contribute to things i

01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,880
don't know

01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:16,079
i tend to use things i don't know first

01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,640
so like if i want to learn

01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,240
like rust i'll i'll find something that

01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,440
like that i can get my brain around

01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,760
that's built in rust and then i will use

01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,440
it

01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,200
and then at that point i have i sort of

01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,079
have a context or at least a platform to

01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,799
stand on to be

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,440
able to to start contributing to it if i

01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:33,440
get that far

01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,640
like again i don't really i don't

01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,160
contribute to a ton of things

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,160
uh i do have a project where i can sort

01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,880
of maintain my contributions and

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,079
i leverage github for that to track

01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,480
stuff i star like

01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,480
one of them is actually stars so um i

01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,920
think we answered that question but

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:51,359
yes what a coincidence um but yeah so i

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,880
have this up because i we sort of round

01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,400
out the conversation where

01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,559
i take a look at your stars so i've just

01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,640
went to slash stars um

01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,880
your name i'm curious if anybody wants

01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,000
to drop in the chat github repos of

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,920
stuff you starred last

01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,119
i'd love to hear from the chat who what

01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,559
they've starred

01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,319
but i'm curious if you just want to call

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,960
out any of these projects and

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,440
tell us why you start them so the benji

01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,640
one

01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,480
we're working together i was looking at

01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,920
this profile i liked it so i started it

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,079
direction i recently added

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,240
bi-directional support to re-mirror the

01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,839
next version oh so now the language

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,240
yeah so now if you're if you type in

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,920
arabic arabic it will automatically

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,079
switch from to right to left if you type

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,680
in english

01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,520
so that's actually a feature already in

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,799
the next version i also added

01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,039
internationalization but

01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,480
that will be further down uh the testing

01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,480
library i hadn't started before so i was

01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,799
like oh i use it a lot let me start it

01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,680
nice prospect change set it's got some

01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,839
cool stuff in it

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,200
and i was i was trying to build a commit

01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,520
uh api

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,559
and it i so i'm looking at it i was

01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,920
looking i was trying to read through it

01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:50,240
it's really hard to understand the code

01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,240
though

01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,240
yeah as in it's like very very detailed

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,839
so i it's not something i can just fork

01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,920
so but i started anyway because i want

01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:59,119
to use it in the future yeah

01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,960
i've built my own version but it's

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,319
really basic

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,319
so i want to use that i like

01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:07,520
i like i like the the guy's a cool guy i

01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,640
follow him on twitter so

01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,480
just start his stuff okay i use it

01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,839
yeah basically if i use your product or

01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,720
if i think it's interesting i will start

01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,719
your project so

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,400
i think we're we're literally the same

01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,719
uh when it comes to

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,440
starring stuff so let me see if i can

01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,199
pull my stuff

01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,560
up um but yeah there's actually there's

01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,239
a lot of interesting projects so i think

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,880
i'm going to star a couple of those

01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,440
in a bit um yeah so if you don't mind

01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,719
i'll just

01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,440
briefly mention the stuff i started

01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:37,279
we're like right up close to time but um

01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,600
there's a conversation around renaming

01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,799
branches from maine to master or default

01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,440
or unstable

01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,719
um oh it looks like yg is actually uh

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,400
you're in the chat but also you have a

01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,279
contribution which is awesome

01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,960
um but yeah there's a basically there

01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,640
was a guide that uh godfrey

01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,400
uh chan can code gavru chan uh but he

01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,400
wrote a guide on how you can migrate

01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,000
your branches without breaking stuff

01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,839
uh because it's a it's kind of a heavy

01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,080
lift i know github

01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:06,000
i guess it was announced uh last week

01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,719
that we're working on something to

01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,199
make this easier but until that happens

01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,279
uh

01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,799
branch rename is a a repo you can

01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,159
actually just read through

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,839
figure that out um i have

01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,279
oh superlender that was another thing i

01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:21,040
was on hacker news yesterday

01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,480
i didn't know it was a thing but uh

01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,279
apparently some people at github built a

01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:29,120
linter to one linter to real mall

01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,960
um which was a yeah it works with vs

01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,480
lands it works of some

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:37,120
other libraries it uses other lenses

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,159
in it's like okay yeah so you just have

01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,080
one

01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:41,920
lint guide so if you're writing ruby and

01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,920
javascript in the same mono repo

01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,600
it should be able to lint it without an

01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:49,759
issue um

01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,279
so that's roughly the idea there um

01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,600
we're going to be hopefully in the point

01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,600
where we'll we'll have uh

01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,679
that working in my project actually uh

01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,440
which brings up to i'll just mention one

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,480
more project which is the pizza face

01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,760
bot um i have a discord server

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:09,040
and um i had a contribution from

01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,159
moni who created a bot and basically

01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,840
pops the

01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,800
pizza face in there to do some

01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,920
interactions as well so pizzaface is

01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,320
literally gonna put that in the chat

01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,320
right now

01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,000
uh but yeah basically discord bot so if

01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,679
anybody wants to see how discord bots

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,040
work definitely check that out

01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:29,280
um and that is it for stars um

01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,080
there was there was one just below g

01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,679
emoji it looked it looked interesting

01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,199
you know i was gonna bring this up too

01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,400
in the conversation

01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,880
and forgot because you were talking

01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,520
about so github has emojis in our

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,400
like in all the markdown this is it this

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,159
is how it works

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:50,320
so if you wanted to ever figure out how

01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:53,040
github does emoji there's also a um

01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,679
yeah so yeah it's built in ruby but

01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,040
there's also

01:10:53,679 --> 01:11:00,159
github emojis

01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,000
markdown oh it's a cheat sheet

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,840
i forgot complete list yeah so have you

01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,960
ever wanted to know

01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:10,560
if you i guess that you could star this

01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,679
how come i can't there we go click it

01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,280
still waiting oh hopefully github's not

01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,120
giving me 500s

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,719
um but anyway there's a whole list of

01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,760
all the emojis that github uses so if

01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,360
you've ever wanted to

01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,040
to know that also if you didn't know you

01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,080
could actually star um

01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,520
just as well

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,000
yeah looks like it's gone i'm not sure

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,000
if that's my browser or if this is

01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,679
what that is but yeah here's the entire

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,850
list of all emojis ever

01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:38,480
on github so definitely check it out

01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:41,679
[Music]

01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,800
looks awesome okay no yeah perfect

01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:46,960
yeah so we're right up on time um

01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,159
i'm super appreciative of you coming on

01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,600
chatting about remir

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,000
i hope everybody in the chat has a

01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,719
chance to uh check it out

01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,320
um test it with their projects that'd be

01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,760
super awesome

01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,600
and also contribute back so obviously

01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,199
it's a real need for documentation

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,120
so if you have interest in working on

01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,920
documentation for a really cool project

01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,719
definitely check it out and then uh if

01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,960
he is there

01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,640
besides your github uh is there other
