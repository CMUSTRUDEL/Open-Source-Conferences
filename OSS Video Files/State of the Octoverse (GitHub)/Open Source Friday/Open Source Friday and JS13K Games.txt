all to the lovely viewers here

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,119
so it's andrei andrei

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,680
yeah i got it yeah perfectly i mean you

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,200
can use

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,240
mdu you can use ender i'm fine with

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
whatever suits you sounds good now you

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,320
say

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
your audio is a little bit low so you

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,719
just want to um i'll get you to talk

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,759
just for a little bit

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
just introduce yourself um and maybe a

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,440
little bit have

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,800
a bit about how you get started um in

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
playing video games and things and all

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
kind of adjust the audio as you're

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,959
chatting

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,120
uh sure so um

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
my company is called enclave games so

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,239
you can imagine

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,040
that if you played fallout

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
there was this faction code enclave

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:43,760
so i was influenced by a fallout

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
fallout 2 to be exact

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,519
and i was uh

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
i was working as a front-end developer

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,720
for many years

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,840
and then decided to switch to

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,000
building games actually which was

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
yeah i was using javascript so i wanted

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
to see if you can build javascript games

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
and it was pretty early but you could do

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
that

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,120
it kind of worked and it went uh

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239
it went from there and i think

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
one of the things that we're here to

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,200
talk about today is json nk games so

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
um for those people who don't know about

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,159
js 13k

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
games would you like to tell us about i

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
mean i could obviously talk about it

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,120
um i don't think i would definitely i

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,560
would do it justice so um

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,959
tell our amazing viewers what js 13k

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,080
games is all about

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
sure so it's an online competition that

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
runs

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,879
yearly since 2012.

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
it runs between

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,400
and september 13th and uh

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,680
if you're an html5 game developer

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,000
uh you are given a task to create a game

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,720
in

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,480
13 kilobytes uh package uh so it's

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,080
quite a challenge uh but uh from what i

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,400
saw uh the participants

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,959
uh really picked that size limit

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
and i think it's it got quite popular

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
because of that

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,919
um so you have a whole month you don't

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
have to

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,160
spend like 48 hours uh locked in a

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
basement

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,400
and drink energy drinks uh

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
you can participate in your own pace uh

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,600
you can

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
work in the evenings uh over the

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,120
weekends if you don't have

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,759
time if you work full-time or if you go

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,560
on two-week vacations

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,120
uh and i think that's uh that's also

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,320
quite

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
uh important in in this competition that

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,320
you don't have to

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,240
rush uh building something so it's not

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
like one of those 48-hour hackathon

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
thing it's more like october 1st or the

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
github hackathon we have running

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
where you can as you said get to work at

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,960
your own pace right

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,520
yeah exactly yeah and i think um one of

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,320
the things i i was like wow 13 kilobytes

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
it that can't be a lot of kilowatts like

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,600
give us

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
some context of like what 13 kilobytes

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
is like

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,960
you know how big are some games like you

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
know standard games these days and like

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
just

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,800
just how small is 13 kilobytes

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,680
uh that's quite small um there are

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,199
small screenshots on the website where

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
the entries are listed

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,240
and those are bigger than the games

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
themselves

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,520
um yes

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,560
the small screenshots

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
so that's that's quite challenging i

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,639
mean

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,400
games right now you usually even web

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,880
games

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,160
are measured in megabytes and

00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,319
desktop games in gigabytes so 13

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,319
kilobytes is really really small

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,840
and it's interesting that

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,199
if you switch your mindset to

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,880
some rules it's actually not

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,919
that small obviously you can't use big

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,199
images

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,240
or big libraries but there is

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,199
um a lib called

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,680
contra which will give you some basic

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,560
tools for starter development

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,919
and with the right approach uh and the

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,039
key here is

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,960
procedural generation

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,960
you can have something shown on the

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,880
on the screen that will look

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,440
interesting and it won't take much space

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,560
so what are some of your top tips for

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,479
saving space

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
in in a game because obviously as you

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
mentioned like half the

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
screenshots on your website more than 13

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,800
kilobytes so how do you actually save

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
that much space

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,560
so um i would recommend checking out the

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,080
resources page uh which is quite long

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,960
uh right now with so many resources

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,880
tutorials

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,360
and articles about

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,800
all the ways to prepare something for

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,240
the competition

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,039
um i would say that

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
if you don't want to create something

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,000
from scratch

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,039
contra js is the most popular uh micro

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
framework

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,319
and it takes a few kilobytes

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
and there are a few tutorials how to get

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,479
started with uh with contra

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:48,160
and you you can use images

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
if you do try to have them in one sprite

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,960
sheet

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:57,440
and you can use tools like tiny png

00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,720
to lower the size of the sprite sheet

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,680
um there are also tools for

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
sounds and music it sounds uh

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,639
interesting that

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,560
an mp3 will have like three megabytes

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
uh but you can still generate sounds and

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
generate

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,160
music using javascript and

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,879
play that in your entry and

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,280
this will fit within the 30 kilobyte

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,000
size limit

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,199
so you might be surprised uh with some

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,560
entries

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,680
uh where they have uh cool graphics

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,399
uh sounds music and all that uh

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,200
and that's all in 30 kilobytes um

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,640
you can remember about the fact that

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,560
this is the

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,480
size of the zip package zip compresses

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,240
text and and code really well

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,240
so if you put everything in one

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,680
index.html if you embed images if you

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,720
generate sounds uh this should compress

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,760
it compress uh really good and

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,240
you should be able to build something

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,279
within the size limit plus we have the

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,600
web xr category where you are free to

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,600
use

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,480
libraries like a-frame which will give

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,600
you

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,000
components for free uh which you can

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
build your game into and i remember

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
people

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,200
were telling me that when they tried

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,839
a-frame

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
uh they didn't even use the whole 13

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,800
kilobytes

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
uh because you could build something in

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,680
like five or six

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
kilobytes zip which is really really

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,279
cool that's pretty insane we've got

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,200
carry in the chat saying the good old

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,360
jquery itself is at least 27 kilowatts

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
and if you think about some of even the

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
early games like ocarina of time i think

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
was

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,600
32 megabytes um which is still in itself

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,240
insane considering the size of games now

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
and so

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,560
when you think of something that's only

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
13 kilobytes you think oh what can't be

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,839
that

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,000
good like it can't be that big it can't

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
be like that intense so what are the

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
kind of games that people are actually

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
producing

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
with 13 kilobytes

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
that's quite interesting because at the

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,120
very beginning like few years ago

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,800
um those games were usually

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,560
simple 2d games because in general

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,720
web games it was a challenge to build

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,000
something for the web

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,600
uh but it evolved over the years

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,079
and i remember i think there's still um

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,680
a question in the rules

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,320
if someone can use webgl and it was uh

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,360
i've written this this like a few years

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,279
ago that

00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,320
you actually can try um

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,880
having webgl but it might be hard to

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,680
create a first person shooter

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,320
and a few people took this as a

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,720
challenge

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:14,000
and they actually built a few 3d

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,560
first person shooters one was called

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,760
something like yet another doom clone or

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,959
something like that

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,120
and it was really really impressive um

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,160
people were building uh 3d

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,800
real-time strategy games uh

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,519
with shaders lighting and everything and

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,399
i'm like

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
i'm blown away by how you could actually

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,560
do that

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
it's like um

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,000
[Music]

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,240
i i had no idea you could you could

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
do something like that and the best

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,240
thing about the competition is that

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,320
every single entry from every possible

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,200
year

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
their source code in a commented form is

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,959
available on

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
github so you can actually play any of

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,200
the

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,839
1 300 something games

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,720
and you can check the source code of

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,160
every

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,360
possible submission and see how

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,320
someone built it and um

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
yeah so you're saying that people aren't

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,000
just making like

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,440
you know pong or tic tac toe anything

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,160
like they're actually making

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,160
like shooters and role-playing games in

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,160
less than 13 kilowatts

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,959
yes that's just like mind-blowing so you

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
mentioned

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,320
this that a lot of the games are

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,519
available actually all the games are

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
available on github

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,040
um so if we jump into and we look at

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,800
some of the

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,079
i think we can look here and look at the

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,399
previous

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,320
games so where if i wanted to find again

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,680
well let's bring out okay

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,160
maybe one of your favorite ones um where

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,639
would we go to find these games and to

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,639
check them out

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,680
so if you click on 2019

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
you should see the page from previous

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,519
years

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,720
and you can click on winners or entries

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,320
at the top at the top yeah

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,600
so um i can't say i have

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,680
one or a few favorite games because

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:34,480
i have like a ton of those

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:37,920
and then uh

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,560
that's like that's uh too

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,959
tough for me i mean uh yeah swag shot

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
yeah

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,920
yeah yeah you can you can find out here

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,320
we're presented with their page we've

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,240
got their twitter um their website and

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,959
then their their github so if we go look

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,079
at their github repo

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,839
all righty they've got a good reading we

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,240
know exactly what it is so intend to be

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
a throwback to the 90s first person

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,639
shooters

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,079
wow um you've got five weapons you got a

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,880
pistol rocket launcher

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,639
a rocket launcher you got me um shotgun

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
machine gun and a railgun and the goal

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,920
is to score as many words as possible

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,639
for eliminating the robots

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
this looks insane yeah

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,000
wow so uh there are

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,120
um so many cool games and the

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,040
level of quality is like

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,120
so intense that um over the years

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:42,880
uh my personal favorites were ending in

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,650
like uh top 20 top 50 top 100

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,279
if you play the entries um

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,639
[Music]

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,040
it's it's insane that the games from

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
like there were games that were ending

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
up like

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,720
year or two years ago in like 100

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,680
uh plays and

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,240
it was my favorite and and uh i was

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
hoping

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,279
for this game to win and it was like 100

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
something

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,920
so take that back over 100 games are

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
submitted every year for this you're

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
saying

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,360
uh actually recently it's 250 around

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,279
that

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,639
wow so over 250 people

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,079
every single year although i'm more

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,680
people because it's

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,079
250 entries there are solo

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,279
developers many of them but there are

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,199
also teams

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,839
i remember some team um

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,720
had like eight people working on an

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,639
entry

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,680
uh so sometimes it's crazy and

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,320
my mind is still on hang on there's

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,839
that many games produced each year just

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,800
for this that are less than 13 kilobytes

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
and um i'm i'm not even surprised by

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,759
stories people telling me that

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,959
they take a vacation from their day job

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
to focus on their competition which is

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,040
kind of

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,399
crazy but it happens

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,000
okay so so this competition it sounds

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
like there's some pretty cool prizes up

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
for grabs that if people are taking time

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,560
off so so what can people

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,440
you know win as prizes and um yeah we'll

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,160
start there first

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,720
what what can you get from being part of

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
this so

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
um yeah there are a whole bunch of

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,759
different prizes

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,839
um usually about 20

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:39,199
20 something different kinds of prizes

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,199
usually those are software licenses for

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,399
anything you can imagine you could use

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,480
for

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,480
game development or front-end

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
development because many participants

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,560
are front-end developers as well

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,160
we also have the tradition of sending

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,240
t-shirts which designs are

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,519
created every single year so you have

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,760
different kinds of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:10,079
designs and if you end up in

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,959

or three years ago but

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,440
uh when i did uh the prices were usually

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,080
worth about

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
20 thousand dollars which is kind of

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
impressive

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,520
i think but the cool thing

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:28,240
the cool thing is people

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:31,760
value participation itself and

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,640
uh like getting feedback from experts

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,919
from judges

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,919
and and creating the games so even

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
though there's a bunch of prizes it's

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,880
not the most important part of the

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,320
competition

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,679
have there been any um like big wins or

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,600
anything like that

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,919
in the last few years like has any like

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,840
game going on to either the game itself

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,160
or developers going on to like

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,840
be part of a bigger company or produce

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,600
like a big game or anything like that

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,799
yeah so um there were games like

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,240
evil glitch or glitchbuster which

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,760
uh won a few years ago and the

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,160
authors of them created

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
so many developers are creating post

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,960
competition

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,160
versions of their games but

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
evil glitch and glitchbuster were the

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
games that

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,640
the developers went one step further and

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,520
they released the games on steam

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
so you could actually buy the games on

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,600
steam

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,919
that were the the prototypes or say

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,320
were uh created uh during the

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,640
competition so that's uh that's kind of

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,919
uh really cool and um

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,480
interesting story uh stories are also if

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,799
you're

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
looking for a job you can participate in

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,600
the competition because

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,520
many developers were recruited because

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,159
of

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
building games for the competition and i

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,919
had

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
success stories from people who

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,320
participated

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,679
some competition some companies were

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,520
supporting the competition recruited and

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
those developers and they were then

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,799
representing those

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:24,000
companies as experts or judges

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:27,280
in the competition which uh which is

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,200
kind of cool that's pretty cool now if i

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,640
have a quick look at your resources page

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
and when i go back to this because

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,039
this is the open source friday stream um

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
check out your resources pages a whole

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
bunch of resources and stuff on

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,760
um how to get started and things like

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,760
that um

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,960
what kind of resources are there or what

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,799
kind of um

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
platforms are people building on top of

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,240
like are there open source

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
platforms that people are taking

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,280
utilizing or

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
or are most of these games like built

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,240
completely from scratch

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:05,280
um it's mostly open source um

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,280
there are so many tools people can just

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,159
use

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,240
for free and modify it and use it

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,200
however they want

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,200
i mentioned contra js which i think is

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,960
the most popular

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,159
micro library um

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,679
but there are so many tools and and

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,320
people are sharing

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
whatever they are building there is a

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,559
guy called

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,520
maxine mozier i hope i'm pronouncing his

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
name right

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,080
nickname sam who built

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:46,480
so many pools

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,799
for 13k before the competition starts

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
that

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,940
it can help with basically anything you

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
can imagine in the competition

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,120
[Music]

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,480
having good controls showing

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,520
emojis processing stuff

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,880
etc etc if you want to play with

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,159
css 3d there are plenty of tools for

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,840
that

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,520
so and this only one guy out of

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,559
like many other people uh

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,760
building uh creating tools

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,000
and sharing them on github

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,880
which i'm really proud of because it's

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
um

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
it's all about the community people

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,200
really

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,679
care for each other and help each other

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
and if you have any issues with anything

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,640
you can

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,480

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
because it is a competition but it's a

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,360
competition

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,280
in which uh you want to build something

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,880
and you can help other developers create

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
something

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
and i think that's uh that's kind of

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
important i think that's what i really

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,039
love about hackathons like even though

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,360
you're all in

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,120
all game jams even though you're all in

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,120
you know different teams you're working

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,559
towards like you know the challenge

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,400
um people are really really

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,480
keen to help like to help other people

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
pages like nearly everything here is on

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,400
github so everyone go check it out

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,120

hey lee

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,280
thanks for dropping in unfortunately um

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,360
we've disabled link sharing on our um

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,039
our twitch stream so um

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
uh thanks for sharing all the links lee

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,840
i'm trying to reshare them back again

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,960
for you

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,360
um because we we don't have link sharing

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
enabled for for a bunch of obvious

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
reasons that

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,080
lately sends his regards over any um

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
anyhow

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,159
now i wanted to um have a quick chat i

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,120
want to have a quick chat

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,320
to um about how you really got into this

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,480
i know you talked a little bit about

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,520
like how just nk games started and

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,400
things like that but

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,559
like i'm assuming that you're a gamer

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,600
yourself right

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,600
yeah yep so how did you get into gaming

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,200
what kind of games do you like

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,880
um so

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,880
i kind of like

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,200
i so i mentioned enclave games uh

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,480
fallout 2 is like an important game for

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,559
me

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,600
um and i think i i pretty early

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,919
started thinking about building games

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,799
even before starting my job as a

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:39,200
front-end developer

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:42,720
i was studying learning c-plus plus so i

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,200
for my bachelor degree i

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,799
created a platformer game in c plus

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,710
because it was the only

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,240
language i was i known back then

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,960
[Music]

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,480
so gaming is obviously important for me

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,279
but

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,080
from the very beginning i thought about

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:06,400
how those games could have been built

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:10,080
and if i could build something similar

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,039
i was playing with jquery

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,559
in like i don't know 2010 ish or

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
something

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
and seeing if you can build anything

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,960
with it

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,320
uh and you can actually you could

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,080
actually build games with jquery

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,600
then some html5 game engines

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,360
started to appear so i experimented with

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,799
that

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:41,120
so i do play games not that

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:45,840
much anymore that i would like to

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,559
but i also enjoy developing games

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
and whenever i play something i imagine

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,880
if i

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,720
could like maybe change it somehow

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,080
or like you know take some lessons from

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,919
that so it's kind of

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,000
uh not 100

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,520
enjoying playing the games but like

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
thinking about

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,960
well maybe i could change this or add

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,559
that to my game or something like that

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,320
yeah i think so now i'm a little bit of

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,880
a gamer myself um

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,360
i play games and stream so i thought i

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,919
would do

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,279
really briefly is um this is the winner

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,760
from last year

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,200
um and by looks it we can literally just

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,159
go onto the website and click

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,039
play the game um this is the person who

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,360
one last year

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,440
would you like to talk to this um and

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,320
also as a judge because you're one of

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,000
the judges

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
what are the judges looking for when

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
they play the game

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,679
um yeah and just maybe some of your

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,799
thoughts on it

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,520
yeah so um it's

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,400
um so the game is really cool you can

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
you control

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,279
the um an entity that have to

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,799
like um go like escape

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,880
uh open the the gates or um

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,000
and um

00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,120
[Music]

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,320
so yeah so the task

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,919
is you have to go to the red

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,159
spot open the gate but

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,159
okay what now

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,520
so the the thing is now you are

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,360
presented with a second

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,720
version of yourself and you have to

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,880
operate so you obviously have to

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:35,919
put one entity

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,320
on the button to open the gate

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:43,360
and use the other to go

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,360
to the second spot

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:52,799
and to make um

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:56,559
as like

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,120
how is this 13 kilobytes

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,120
exactly

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,360
that's a good question i mean you can

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,039
check the source code

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,960
um there are so many lessons learned

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:14,080
uh blog posts uh called postmortems

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,559
where you can read about how the games

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,880
were actually created

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,799
and about about the judging about the

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,840
scoring so basically

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,360
experts right now focus on giving

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,799
constructive feedback because um

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,760
when i asked what what what is the most

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,640
important aspect of the competition many

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,880
people

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,080
respond that feedback from the judges

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
from the experts so

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
getting feedback from the experts saying

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
that this

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,120
was really good and this could be

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,240
improved

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,840
uh was really really important and

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,760
um so the voting system is actually

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:04,080
um participants themselves

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,799
voting for uh each other's games

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,799
so they can

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,159
they can really value stuff

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
because they know how hard it is to

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,480
build uh

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,480
something in 15 kilobytes

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:29,039
like yeah

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
um yeah so there are so so many really

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
cool games

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,440
i mean you can play those games for

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,200
hours

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,200
um there are games

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,520
blowing your mind and they were like

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,840
26th

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,960
place two years ago or something like

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,039
that so

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,000
it's it's really impressive that the

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,520
level of quality is so high

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,159
yeah i mean this is just blowing my mind

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,480
right now

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,200
at how this is able to be 13 kilobytes

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
like

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,240
there's like sounds in it there are

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,000
like different like look at all the

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,720
things that are happening on the screen

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,039
um even like little things i'm picking

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,440
up like the fact that there's a light

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:13,200
over the current like this the one that

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,960
i'm currently controlling

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,480
um so you can see as i move it around

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,520
like there's a light that shines a

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,919
little bit

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,679
um the animation of taking you back all

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,000
these extra things outside the fact it's

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,919
also

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,919
3d i'm just like yeah

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,919
so uh it was interesting that um

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,080
it was actually in the very first year

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,799
already that i learned

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
i mean uh there was one game that

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,640
eventually

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,159
won the competition in 2012 uh called

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,760
space p

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,440
um which uh so i was

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,159
play testing the games to see if they

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,679
work so i can accept them

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:58,720
but i started playing space p and after

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
one hour or so i realized that i should

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,240
[Music]

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,960
be

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,559
i think oh i have a bug there you have

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,440
to remove the

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
eight zero parts from the url sorry

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
about that

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,399
this is the one that won back in the

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,519
first time yeah so so it won in 2012

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,240
and so the the most impressive

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,679
thing about this game was that it didn't

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,919
look like a game created in 30 kilobytes

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
um

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,679
it looked full it looked like a

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,679
full game

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,960
that somebody didn't care about the 15

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,600
kilobyte limit so

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,200
the game is the game mechanic is rather

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,399
simple you defend

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:57,200
your planet uh from attacks

00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:00,240
and then you get some bonus points coins

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,640
extra stuff you can upgrade your

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,440
base so the the the most impressive part

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,799
was that

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,919
uh it didn't look like 13 like somebody

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,960
has to

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,320
compromise something for the size

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,679
of 13 kilobytes it just looked like a

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,880
complete game with

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:28,559
many options levels

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:33,440
uh bonuses etc etc

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:36,399
like almost like um a

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,159
system where you can like upgrade and

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,360
buy things like that

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,480
exactly wow so this is the first so when

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,480
you this was obviously the first year

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,559
did you even think that something like

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,519
this was possible

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,799
no i mean every single year i'm really

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,760
surprised but

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,080
by what can you actually build within

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,080
the

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,000
size limit i had no idea you can like

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:08,000
build so many cool games and seeing

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,679
first-person shooters or like uh

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,279
real-time strategy games uh 3d

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:19,360
uh with shaders and everything that's um

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:24,720
that's like super impressive

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:27,600
and you can you can github as well

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,159
yes so as i mentioned before every

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,840
single

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,640
entry from every single year uh

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,960
their source code in a readable form

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,480
because you submit a compressed

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,279
minified code to the competition

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,760
but you also have to provide a link to

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,600
the

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,960
github repository with commented or

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,360
at least readable for a source code

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,120
so you can actually see how the games

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,120
were implemented

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,399
uh i was worried that people will copy

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,440
that and submit in the

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,200
next years as their own

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,320
interestingly enough this doesn't happen

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,440
uh so i'm i'm really happy that people

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
use that to learn

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,919
and um yeah so so for example the next

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,879
year

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,599
the the exact same guy won the the

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,599
second year

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,599
with even better game and then i think

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,639
it was like third or fourth year when

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,599
he built another game that was even

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,159
better than the first two but he ended

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,720
up in

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,679
i don't know top 10 or top 20 because

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,440
the level of quality already increased

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:51,359
so it's super impressive to see

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,480
more and more high quality games

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,800
and as i mentioned one of my favorites

00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,000
from two or three years ago

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,000
that would totally win the competition

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,160
in 2012 2013

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,200
or 14 ended up one in 100

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,160
something place uh

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,760
so yeah that's better right absolutely

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,839
yes

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,440
and like if we look at all of these like

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,440
not all the games have them but like

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,560
most of the games i'm seeing have

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,160
um like a license which means they

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
they are open source if you've got a

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,359
license you can open source it

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,119
um and that's really good to hear that

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,839
not everyone is taking

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,280
those games and um just simply rehashing

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,960
them or building on top of them actually

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
creating something brand new

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,800
every year and i think that's like a

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,560
testament to what you've built

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,000
um and also the type of people who are

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,839
coming in i think that's that's just

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,200
really cool and it's so good to hear

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,359
there's just grown

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,560
so much um there's probably a bunch of

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,320
people either

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
that are listening right now or that are

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,079
gonna be watching the vod

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
afterwards um they're like hey this is

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,800
really cool

00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,000
i would love to do it what are your tips

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,520
for like just getting involved

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,040
uh so there was a famous quote

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,720
um how do i start making games how do i

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,079
become a game developer and

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,240
the answer is start making games

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:20,320
because there are so many tutorials

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,880
and so many learning material that

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,400
to become a game developer you can just

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,200
start building games and

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,400
and that's it there's no certificate no

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
nothing

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,040
that gets you there if you start

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,560
building games you're a game developer

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,240
already

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,480
so there are plenty of resources uh

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,280
if you want to learn from the uh

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,200
competition

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,240
people are writing uh post mortems

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,240
in which they describe what went good

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,359
uh during the development of the game

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,800
for the competition

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,880
what they could have done better

00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,560
etc etc so yeah in general

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
if you want to start building games just

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,440
start building games and

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:09,280
i think the the most important part

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,720
is like playing with the code creating

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,079
something for fun

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,680
and seeing if this works um

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,359
and um you can

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,800
it could be your day job it's not

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,800
easy i would say if you want to earn a

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,440
lot you could probably stay as a

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,800
front-end developer in a corporation

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,240
but if this is your passion and you

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,079
want to make money out of that you can

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,560
many games that were submitted to the

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,240
competition

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,440
were then submitted to

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,440
publisher portals where publishers

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,960
pay for having those game

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,000
games on the on their website so

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,480
you can actually make money out of

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,920
uh creating games even for the

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,240
competition

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,440
uh you can create games outside of the

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,160
competition for

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,599
game portals we also have the web

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,599
monetization category which is like a

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,880
new thing where you can actually

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,320
earn money out of people just

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,320
playing your games so that's

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,880
that's something you should definitely

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,880
check out

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,720
yeah i mean if you want to

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,480
if you want to become a game developer

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,760
just

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,040
start building games and uh with

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,280
uh with the experience uh you will build

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,800
better and better games and we will be a

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,920
better developer

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,760
i think that's something we've talked

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,760
about a lot on these open source friday

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,119
streams and something that um nick

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,960
young from contour brought up a couple

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,320
weeks ago to people like how do i get

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,920
involved in open source how do i get

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,720
involved in this and we kind of just

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,400
i the answer is always just start it

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
doesn't matter what it is whether it's

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,359
game development whether it's open

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,760
source that you want to get involved

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,160
with it's

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,599
you know just being a developer content

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,119
creation like anything

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,280
is really i think the answer is nearly

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
always just just start because if you

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
start somewhere

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,000
then you can kind of grow from there and

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,640
i think um something like

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,960
js certain games is a really good way to

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,920
get started in game development um

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,320
i think the fact that it's um you know a

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,800
small

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,359
threshold is so good and one of the guys

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,680
in the chat

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,640
tacky man um who i know as a developer

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,640
as well he's just like

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,079
just find a passion plain and simple and

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,280
then you just go for it right if you're

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,079
passionate about something

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,800
just do it um and i know some people are

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,079
listening in

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,839
now and watching the vod later might be

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,760
thinking hey this is really good i do

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,000
actually really want to get started

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,359
um are there opportunities for people in

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
js that incame

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,800
um games you've kind of mentioned it

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,960
just touched a little bit um

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,400
but to to find a team and to find other

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,839
people to build a game with you kind of

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,359
mention the slack channel but

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,240
other opportunities for people to find

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,000
people and submit as a team

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,280
yes absolutely we have a team's

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,240
channel where people can connect and

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,440
every single year i'm seeing people

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,640
joining teams

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:22,000
and um it can get really crazy because

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,680
like a few years ago we so there is a

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,800
js 1k there was js 1k competition where

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,480
you built something in one kilobyte

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,000
extreme and

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,160
so a bunch of people joined forces

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
i don't remember it was like five or ten

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,520
different developers

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,720
and they created an entry called

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:50,079
26 games in one

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,359
well and there was like 26

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:58,079
games in one 13 kilobytes

00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:01,200
package and that's yeah

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,160
so half a kilobyte yes

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,000
so that's like and there is a whole

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,000
bunch of examples like those

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,440
and here i am sitting here going why

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,800
does forza take up

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,240
76 gigabytes of space on my game and you

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,839
know people can build a game for a half

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,240
kilowatt

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:23,760
yeah so um i really like seeing

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,400
people connect and team up with

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,880
other developers from around the world

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,560
and

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,560
uh building something for the

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,440
competition so you can even if you're

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,800
totally

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,119
new haven't built anything you can

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,560
join the community join forces with

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,440
someone

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,319
and there are so many success stories of

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,760
people

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,319
starting uh from scratch not knowing

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,240
anything

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,640
joining team creating something and then

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,160
sharing this and saying that well this

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,359
was the very first

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,480
game i have built and

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,200
there are many success stories of people

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,079
then starting to work on other games or

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,200
like joining

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,839
a company building games etc etc so it's

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,280
a

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,640
it's a great opportunity and

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,839
the the tools on the resources page

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,319
are mostly by other developers just

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,319
creating something for their own

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,440
use and then realizing other people

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,040
could use that as well

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,400
so for example you have written some

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,119
um some micro engine or like tool that

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,880
will

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,760
compress images better or like will

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
help you do something you can uh since

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,839
you know how to put stuff on github

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,440
because you are

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,160
having your game there already

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
you can share the tools as well put it

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,319
on

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,599
github on the resources page

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,280
and other people can already use them

00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,720
and that's what open

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,040
source could be it is basically using

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,560
other people open source stuff and

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,599
contributing if

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,880
uh i'm seeing um discussions in the

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,440
contra channel about

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,960
stuff that could be added to the library

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,079
the author is there

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,119
so he's literally fixing

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,520
any issues instantly

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,640
and like after five minutes it's like

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,359
hey this is

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,400
like fixed and this is the next release

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,960
so

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,480
uh it's really awesome to see that the

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,720
whole community working on

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,160
improving tools so you've got the

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,800
maintainers of

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,800
certain repos helping out like while

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,599
this is going on so they've kind of got

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,560
in their head that hey just 13k games is

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,000
is available

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
we're here to help is that kind of how

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,319
it works

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,400
yes exactly and it's it's really great

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,800
to see people collaborate

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,599
um like yesterday we announced something

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,200
called

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:06,839
os 13k which is like a

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,920
micro operating system with

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:14,160
trophies and all the stuff

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,800
that so basically uh games um

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,640
showcased on the website uh share the

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,560
same local storage

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,880
so they so we usually say don't

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,560
do don't clear the whole storage because

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,560
you will remove

00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,040
all the saves from other games

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,160
but they took this back well it's not a

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,079
back but like

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,960
it's not a back it's a feature saying

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,240
that they are using that to have

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,400
to be able to create trophies from

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,000
any game submitted to the competition

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,280
and this trophy will be

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,400
showcased in the os 13k

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,440
so you can actually see all the trophies

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,480
you can get

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,079
in different games submitted to the

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,560
competition

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,000
it's also pro it's also providing some

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,119
tools to share

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,520
your generated sounds or music

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,880
uh so you can actually have like a

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,680
playlist

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:18,000
of uh of different kinds of music that

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:22,000
is present uh in

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,079
in the competition entries so um

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,520
and like i don't know like five or seven

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,960
or ten different people

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:33,119
worked on having that released uh so i'm

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,920
really proud of community of

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,720
of those people doing that for fun and

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,720
releasing that

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,079
and giving that to other developers to

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
play with

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,680
and if we look at the resources page we

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,680
kind of touched on a little bit like

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,359
most of like especially the top bit the

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,880
game engines and boilerplates

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,720
most of this stuff is on github and

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,040
you're saying like the maintainers are

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,880
getting a lot out of it by having um

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,880
getting feedback directly from the

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,079
people who are using the product

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,599
or using the um the repo and the the

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,160
making changes on the fly

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,520
for the game are you seeing or do you

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
know if there's any of the maintainers

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,240
of seeing

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,760
a um an uptake in contributions around

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,079
this time like are any of these people

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,359
working on their games they going back

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,920
and then contributing to any of these

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,960
projects do you know of

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,640
um yeah i mean there are many cases

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,200
where

00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,359
[Music]

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,119
people create some libraries and then

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:35,520
and other

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,520
developers contribute to those or

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:44,560
they help each other

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:49,119
send some bug fixes etc so

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,960
there is a vibrant community and

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,319
since the all the source code is on

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,520
github

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,640
i'm seeing many developers helping each

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,160
other

00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,119
and and contributing back

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,839
and since like many people use contra

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,839
for example

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,400
a spike in activity around this library

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,599
during the competition is really high

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,560
and

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,000
the author itself adds a lot of stuff

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,359
and

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,400
other developers are also contributing

00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,480
by just using or testing it but also

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,559
adding some some features

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,160
um so it's uh it's really cool to see

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,280
um this kind of uh like the

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,079
community helping each other yeah i

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,000
think that's right

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,520
i kind of said it before about the

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
hackathons and that's one of the reasons

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,280
why i love hackathons so much and

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,680
in game jams it's just people helping

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,800
everyone else and helping each other and

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,640
building the community

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,559
and you know contributing to each

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,760
other's code and helping one another out

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,559
even though they're all in competition

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,040
so i think that's

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,400
something i really like and um you know

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,400
big kudos to yourself

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,160
um for getting this going and like it's

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,760
been running for like what eight years

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,559
now this is its ninth year

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,119
yeah um so what is your vision for js

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,720
13k

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,599
games moving forward and where do you

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,599
see it kind of going

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:19,680
um i would like to see it grow

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,000
in a way it grows over the years because

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,359
it's

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,920
um i'm really impressed that

00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,790
every single year there is something new

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,559
happening around the competition

00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:33,680
[Music]

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,160
the the webxr category was introduced

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,079
like

00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,400
three years or four years ago web

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,920
monetization last year

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,559
um i'm getting so much help

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,319
uh running the competition from from

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,319
developers that helped build

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:53,520
the validation board so i don't have to

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,400
manually check the submissions

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,960
or like the voting system so people can

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,160
actually

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,920
focus on on that

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,760
so i'm i'm really thankful to all the

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
developers helping with the competition

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
and i can imagine that

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:14,480
uh in the next year

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,839
we will have more tools

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,720
more developers help me with the

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,720
competition and

00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,280
i'm i'm happy with how the competition

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,559
is evolving

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,559
and growing uh over the years so i

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,200
i don't have any like high expectations

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,000
or anything i'm just happy with how it

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,920
works

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,480
every single year and that people are

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,839
happy to develop games and submit the

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,880
competition

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,680
and they are building

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,920
pools and and experiences that i

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:52,160
couldn't even imagine are possible like

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,680
the 26 games in one or like

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:59,040
tiny operating system uh or like

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,559
real-time strategy games in in 3d webgl

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,400
with shaders and whatnot

00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,480
so uh i'm really impressed by the

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,960
quality of games and

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:13,599
i would like to see this slowly forever

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,720
i think from what i'm seeing right now

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,920
it looks like it's definitely going to

00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,319
be on going on for

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,440
a fairly long time now you've been

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,400
pretty much solo

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,079
ship steering js 7k games we can see on

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,599
your website you've got a bunch of

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,839
really cool judges

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,280
um and it looks like they're from all

00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,720
over the world in so many different time

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
zones so how do you all

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,200
work together to judge the games and to

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,440
um you know come up with the winners and

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,440
things

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,000
so there are um

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,200
two parts to that so um the experts

00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,480
actually

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,280
uh because previously we had

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,680
judges who are playing the games but it

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,079
was

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,559
okay when you had 60 entries but with

00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,680
250 it's

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,640
really tough to play all the games we

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,640
had some

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,119
judges that were playing all of them but

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,780
it's really hard to

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,720
play all and judge them um

00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,079
[Music]

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,359
in a way that uh that will be fair so

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,960
we so the competition evolved and we

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:24,480
have experts who are actually providing

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,720
feedback uh playing

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,319
small amount of games comparably small

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,839
so for example

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,920
an expert have um so

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,720
when the competition submission time

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,800
ends september 13th and the winners are

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,240
announced on october 4th

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,440
an expert have three weeks to play

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,040
given games like 20 or 30 games

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,400
and provide

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,760
written feedback of playing those games

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,599
and saying

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,760
this was really good this could be

00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,119
improved and as i mentioned

00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,000
developers really value the feedback

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,839
and then there's also the voting system

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,520
in which developers themselves who

00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,559
submit the games

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,359
vote on other people's games and then

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,559
winners

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:17,760
are announced out of that

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,839
so we have the best experts in the field

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,319
who create the games and they also vote

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,079
for for the games

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:28,880
and and the winners are announced out of

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,240
that voting yeah that sounds sounds

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,640
pretty good and i think um

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,160
as you i just said like people really

00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,760
value that feedback

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,760
and i think that is one of the reasons

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,240
why a lot of people get involved in

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,240
game jams or hackathons is to normally

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,200
build out their their profiles and their

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,960
cv

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,960
um or for a lot of people build out

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,760
their github contribution graph

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,119
um it's to get that you know that

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,559
industry

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,640
expertise that industry um experience

00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,240
and to get the feedback from the people

00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,960
so if this is something you do want to

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,640
get into

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,000
you've got that really good feedback and

00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,480
a really good base that you can go and

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,960
like build on top of so um

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,640
absolutely absolutely i mean uh there

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,280
are there were many cases

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,040
in which uh participating in the

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,240
competition or having any

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,760
open source stuff or like anything as a

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,079
hobby

00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,559
was an advantage in a job interview so

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,040
one thing is having skills or job

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,319
experience but the other is

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,359
having some some passion and having some

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:34,160
cool projects to show because there were

00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,400
many

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,680
cases where somebody was recruited

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,520
because

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,480
a recruiter saw a game submitted to the

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,440
competition

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,000
which which is really cool for me so you

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,839
can say

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,359
everything you've built has been helping

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,920
people get jobs which is

00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,119
incredible absolutely amazing i just i

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,599
think it's great i mean

00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,119
um i don't know how much you've looked

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,040
into my background or anything like that

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,800
and i don't expect you to of all but

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,640
you know that is the reason why i love

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,400
running hackathons is because

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,400
um especially when i had my first

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,800
company when we hired people

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,400
our question was have you actually been

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,920
a hacked on like you know we're hiring

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,520
for a developer role it's like have you

00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,400
been a hacker if the answer was no it's

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,480
like well

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,480
what that's okay but have you done

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,680
anything outside your university degree

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,680
because if you haven't

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,960
it says you're not passionate about what

00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,880
you're doing

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,599
and for people to give up their time to

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,720
either go to a hackathon or participate

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,559
in a game jam

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,240
or be part of something like

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,520
hacktoberfest or something like that it

00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,480
just shows that you're actually

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,839
passionate

00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,119
about that and that's what people want

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,799
to hire for they don't necessarily just

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,640
want to hire for your skills i mean

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:42,240
your skills are good but you can kind of

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,599
teach skills you can't really teach

00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
you know the passion the drive and the

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,280
motivation so i think you know it's

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,240
fantastic you put something together

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,200
like this yeah if if you have like

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,160
hundreds of cvs and you have to look for

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,520
something that will

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,480
stand out uh those kind of projects

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,760
those kind of

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,640
activities uh definitely help yeah 100

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,240
great so um

00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,160
if anyone in the chat or those are

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,079
watching whatever there's a link

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,520
um go join up um if you're interested in

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,280
in game development if you're interested

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,720
in um you're writing

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,720
your games in tiny little files um and i

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,200
think yeah techy man is exactly right do

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,119
you

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,480
have to have a portfolio outside your

00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,319
actual portfolio

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,319
um so you have your portfolio of your

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,760
skills and the jobs that you've done

00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,359
um but what about what are your

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,760
extracurricular activities and how do

00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,079
they

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,079
um play into you know the job that

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,520
you're looking for because as you've um

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,920
said andre is um you know everyone

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,440
when who goes for an interview you've

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,000
pretty much all got the same skills

00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,480
because you're

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,240
playing for the job so what makes you

00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,440
stand out and i think it's you know it's

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,440
those things like

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,119
hey i've i participated in third even if

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,720
you don't win even if you don't get in

00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,160
the top ten all the top 100

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,720
you know the fact that you actually i

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,040
mean yes there are there are so many

00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,040
like

00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,960
i there are so many games submitted to

00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,000
the competition but i'm over the years

00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,839
i'm learning about people

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,119
who are building something but didn't

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,359
submit it

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,480
and i realized that there are many of

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,960
those because

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,720
i was participating in many jams and i

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,799
didn't submit something

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,359
because i didn't finish it so there are

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,160
like hundreds of games every year

00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,880
that aren't submitted to the competition

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,920
and

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,319
it's i mean we were talking about this

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,079
that

00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:31,040
um if you submit something that is

00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,920
buggy and if you think it's ugly but it

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,920
works

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,000
that's already an achievement you

00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,680
already submitted something

00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,920
uh because there were many people

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,839
building and and didn't finish

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,359
so if you finish it you can call it the

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:48,480
0.1 version and just

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,200
improve the post competition versions uh

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,200
but it's

00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,799
if you can submit something that's

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,119
already an achievement

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,119
i i

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,760
the idea unders pitch the thing or just

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,599
you just do the actual thing and then

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,520
you know what is actually more important

00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,640
is what you say after you know i've i've

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,480
done this game

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,319
but i'm planning on when i've got more

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,520
time or you know the next day i'm

00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:12,880
planning to do this

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,119
and this and this and this and i think

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
that's what people really value the fact

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,319
that you've thought about the next stage

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,240
and that that's not what

00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,599
um you know that's not the only the be

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,240
all and also that was actually going to

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,839
be my

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,440
my last question to you as you know what

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,960
are your tips to people who are

00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,559
a bit worried about submitting games or

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,280
whatever evil you basically answer

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,920
questions just

00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,559
just go for it anyway yeah go for it i

00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,440
mean if

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,160
if you uh write your plan if you want to

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,559
if you start

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,160
building something throw away as much as

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,880
possible

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,960
don't over complicate it if it's simple

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,520
enough you will be able to

00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,880
finish the development submit the game

00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,200
and then you can work

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,840
after the competition with some extra

00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,119
stuff so

00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,640
[Music]

00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:59,280
removing extra stuff removing what's not

00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,119
necessary as a way to go so you have

00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,440
like a working prototype and you still

00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,440
have

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,640
if you still have time and you still

00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,640
have space

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,480
now you can add something on top of it

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,760
but if you have a working prototype you

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,160
can submit it in

00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,920
any time even if something happens and

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,880
you lose two weeks because

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,480
uh your family will tell you we have to

00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,880
go on a vacation

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,160
uh you still can submit something and be

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,680
happy with it i

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,160
think that's the thing right is that

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,000
you've really got nothing to lose

00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,760
yeah just don't mean what are you gonna

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,200
lose you mean you might not get the top

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,359
prize but that's not

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,240
the end of the world so i think um yeah

00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,960
i think your

00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,280
your tips and um ideas there just you

00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,440
know

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,280
so valuable for so many people who are

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,880
looking at this industry going

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,079
i don't know where to get started i'm

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,119
worried about submitting something

00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,079
that's not finished i think

00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,000
you've kind of answered all the

00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,040
questions for people and now it's kind

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,640
of up to

00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,760
you know the viewers here and anyone

00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,599
else who's thinking about getting

00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,680
involved in games or hackathons

00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,040
is it's it's really up to you now to

00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,640
just go and do it

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:02,319
i think i mean if i would be a recruiter

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,400
and i would sing

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:09,920
one big unfinished mmo rpg

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,160
versus 10 simple html5 games that you

00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,280
can play directly in the browser

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,559
that that is important that the the

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,720
second case is

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,920
someone who can actually finish and

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,200
deliver projects

00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,520
in limited time uh so that's uh

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,200
that's really really important yes

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,160
or small constraints but whichever way

00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,760
you want to look at it

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,520
oh another thing i think you know

00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,760
everything you said is just so on point

00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
and

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,200

not all of them have open source

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,240
licenses but a good majority of them do
