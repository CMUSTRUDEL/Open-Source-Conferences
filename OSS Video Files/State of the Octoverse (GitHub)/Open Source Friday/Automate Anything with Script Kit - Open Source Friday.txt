the original

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,279
people at egghead dot io and egghead's

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,080
the

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,440
place you go to build your dev portfolio

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,160
uh gain the skills you need to get the

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,120
job you want

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,519
so um head on over to egghead.io there

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,480
you go

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,359
you said an ad that's an ad excellent um

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
and

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,960
uh we're here to talk about something

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840
you've been working on which is

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,039
called script kit um well actually is it

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,279
called script kit

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
it is called script okay excellent and

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,800
uh which is like what a weird question

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,640
to ask when i invited you to come on and

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
talk about your project but um

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
uh do you want to tell us what what is

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
script kit

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,160
yeah it's a script kit is a tool that

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
allows you to

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,559
write run and

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,120
write edit share everything scripts

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,760
that allow you to automate your workflow

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
on your

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,920
computer so these scripts are

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
scripts you write with javascript they

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,719
can be

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
um easily edited and updated and easily

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,240
run

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
from a prompt that pops up when you when

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,080
you launch

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
the script kit app so and while

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
those scripts can run in the app they

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
can also run in the terminal they could

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
run in a github workflow

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
these scripts are meant to be portable

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
as well so there's

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
plenty of ways to run them and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
installing one as

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,920
easy as like if you just you have the

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
app open you can just click one of those

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
buttons

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
and uh hit open kit

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
so yeah go ahead and uh name we'll name

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
a script uh

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
you know pick some name i gave some

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,200
suggestions there

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
oh nimble motion looks like a great one

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,360
this is like uh

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
starting up a netifly site sure throwing

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
together

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,759
two different random nouns okay so which

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
editor do i use

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,360
code and oh and that it'll cache that

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,280
excellent and that gives me

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
so this is me building my own script and

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
this is just walking me through okay

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,320
excellent so what's the i guess what's

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
the next step i

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,680
created the script i now can console.log

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,879
nibble motion

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,599
into the logs yep so go ahead and

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,160
open so script kit defaults to command

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,160
semicolon

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,440
and you should see the nibble motion in

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
your list yep and you can

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
either click or hit enter and it'll run

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
that script

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,720
um if you look in the logs directory

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,760
over on the left

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,120
you can see there's a console.log file

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,239
there and you could you could tail that

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
or just keep on

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,400
checking okay so when this like there's

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,200
no deploy step for this

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
nope okay excellent uh also very

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
excellent

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,160
type in my github you just name it um

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,560
which you all should know it is and

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,599
i definitely type that that is true

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
there you go so

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,840
excellent so this is showing like

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,120
from creating your first script

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
and um

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
prompting the user for an argument and

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
then displaying a window with some html

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
as far as like

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
there's already a ton of things you

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
could do with just that yeah

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
and that's all that it took like we're

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,120
10 seconds into showing this off and

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
that that's all that it took

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
there's already been a comparison which

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,519
you made this already when our

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
conversations the first five minutes

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
when you saw

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
my screen but alfred um folks are

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
comparing this to alfred and

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,640
like would you compare this alfred or is

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
this completely different

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,159
so i i would say it people will

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,239
automatically compare any tool that

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
pops a prompt open to alfred

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,959
or alfredo sauce which i love as well

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,560
but alfred is a

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,720
by default it's an app launcher and it

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
has like these default

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
uh tools as far as searching files and

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,439
it's it's a wonderful tool i've used it

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
for years

00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,720
yeah and i absolutely love it um

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,439
where script kit differs

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,280
is that it's not for it's not explicitly

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
for those things that alfred is for

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,319
it's for writing and managing your own

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,959
scripts

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
um alfred doesn't have any of that sort

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
of stuff

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
you can't go into alfred and say um

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
create new script they have like a

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,120
concept of

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
workflows which you use a ui and you

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
drag and drop lines together

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
and all that sort of stuff and those

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,520
work great

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,840
um what i

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
the reason script kit exists is because

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,560
it's targeting developers like this is

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
an automation tool

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,080
for developers who know how to write

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
code and

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,960
they don't want to um like you don't

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
want to go through all those uis which

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,199
can't do like all the things that script

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,840
it can do so

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,000
it the comparison kind of ends at there

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
are alfred workflows which have a

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,560
limited

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
i mean you could run any bash script

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
from inside them so i guess you could

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
say it's unlimited but

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah this is this brings you your

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
scripts into the javascript ecosystem

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
any npm package works and you have like

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,280
that whole

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,199
sharing scripts is as easy as either

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
copy and pasting it into

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,880
a chat window or you can generate share

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
links all that stuff is

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,280
but his other question was what's your

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,039
favorite scripts that you've seen or

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,400
that you've written

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,320
um so there's a lot in the if you

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,320
open the uh kit again

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,039
um just just just command semicolon oh

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,600
yep

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,479
um so if you go to the hot tab you can

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,919
either hit tab or click on it um

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,400
oh nice you just want to make your

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,520
prompt a bit bigger so he's on a

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,840
1280x720 screen that's why things are so

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
small

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,759
so this is another this is another thing

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,800
where this is a community focused

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
tool where people share scripts so in

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
the hot tub i'm going to keep a list of

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
like scripts that people publish where

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,319
you can go and check out

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
what they're doing this is the script

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,880
i'm using right now i have this

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,479
run so i have a cron that runs every 30

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,280
seconds to see how many downloads

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,000
scriptkit has had and then it updates my

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,000
twitter name

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,160
so if you look at my look at my account

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,440
on twitter

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,680
you'll see whatever

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,880
so now it's had if someone clicks the

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,720
download button we could come back and

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,440
check in 30 seconds and you'll see the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
that number will go up that is which is

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,479
amazing

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,840
which is it's ridiculous right but it's

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,039
you know it's one of those things that

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
makes me laugh

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
yeah it's funny because like i have a i

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,199
have a um

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
not a script i have a query a graphql

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
query to check to see if i'm live on

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
twitter

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
and not twitter on twitch uh because i

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
want to build something very similar to

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
this

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,720
so i can update my twitter name to

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
basically say i'm live

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
um so check when i'm live it's gonna say

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
i'm live

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
uh and it sounds like i already solved

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
another problem in like the next

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
the next five minutes of this

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,280
conversation awesome

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
yeah and that's where like this script

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
um

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
it's it's kind of more advanced to like

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,840
compose scripts together but it's

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
totally possible to have

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,759
one script call another script so if you

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
had one task was

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,039
one script was to you know query do a

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,280
graphql query and it had some sort of

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
output it could then pass that into

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,599
this script you wouldn't have to even

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
like compose them into us

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,880
here i'll show you something really cool

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
here now go go back to

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,360
the script yep um

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
go to the top of the file this this

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,680
isn't in the tutorial

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,680
but on line one do write a comment

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,840
just create a new line and write a

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,800
comment and say shortcut with a capital

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,160
s

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,479
and colon then space like

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,479
opt space t like option t

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,280
probably probably lowercase t i don't

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,080
think it matters i hit save

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,080
now hit option t

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,520
oh do you have option t bound to

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,879
something in code uh yeah it's the um

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,879
okay pick the them bindings

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,960
let's try this one more time uh option g

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,919
there we go oh got it so you basically

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,039
can route the shortcut that is that's

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
amazing

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,400
you can route it route the script to a

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
shortcut which

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,160
in the case of things like updating your

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
twitter name

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
i could see routing it when i go live

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,279
just hit the shortcut rather than

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
running a cron

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,240
yeah and that is genius and you said

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
that this is not in the uh

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
the tutorial but this is this in the

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
docs the the shortcuts

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,080
if you look at the yeah if you go over

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
to the docs in the discussions there's

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,720
just kind of like a beta discussions in

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,519
the docs

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
um it's one of the categories over on

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
the left

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,959
just docs docs um so if you look at

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,959
metadata

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,560
so these shortcuts the app will

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,040
automatically watch your scripts

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
for any of those shortcuts you put in

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,399
and bind that shortcut

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,959
just globally to that script yeah um

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
the the menu one will make it so you can

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
search for

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
like a better name for the menu and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
description as we'll be will be in there

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
if you scroll down a bit you can get

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
into some of the

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,360
oh and there's the attribution stuff so

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,560
if you share a script with somebody and

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,560
you put author and twitter in there

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,839
then when they run your script they'll

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,320
see in the upper right they'll see your

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,680
your name to show that you wrote that

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
not a new file

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,680
so so i recommend i recommend using new

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,160
from the menu and here let me show you

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
why go

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,000
go over to your actually let's let's do

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,720
it this way

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,720
open script kit the command semicolon

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
go over to help

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,720
and search for add it's like add

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,920
to your profile yeah

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
this one yep

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,399
and you probably use esh i assume uh

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,399
actually i've been using batch rc okay

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
so whatever whatever terminal

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
you want to add so there you go you now

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,040
have um if you hit enter here it'll do

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
the exact same

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,920
thing so this script when you use

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
new from the app it's going to generate

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
if you look

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,640
in the directories over in the left

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,399
there's a bin directory at the top yep

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,320
and if you look at nipple motion

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
you can see essentially this is the

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,120
heart of

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
script kit um setting up it runs it has

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
a node installation

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
itself or just you know the executable

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
itself

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
um it loads the dot end most people are

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
familiar

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
developers are usually familiar with

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,279
loading.n files yeah

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,360
and then there's a the core library is

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,200
that mac dash terminal library

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,440
when you run it from the terminal or

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,000
there's a mac dash

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
app library when you load it from the

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
app

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
and those provide all the read file

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,200
write file

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,560
arg and all that sort of stuff and then

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
that shoots

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
all of your script on line eight and

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,120
then all the arguments on line nine

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,959
um and it loads that all into

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
on line five is where it actually calls

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,959
no separate from your global node

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,519
modules so you'll in your canv directory

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,560
you'll see

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,360
a node modules folder um

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,160
that keeps them all in there and what's

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
recommended

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,320
is if you want to um

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
if you want to install a node modules uh

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,959
or sorry a node

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
package node library um there's a weight

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,000
npm

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
so if you use if you just go ahead and

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,399
create a new script real quick

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,279
like i i when when i'm showing people

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,480
this i want them to be really

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
comfortable like

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
just go ahead and create a script like

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
just like instead of instead of talking

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
about it let's just do it um

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,920
you can call it wealthy ducks or

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,839
whatever wealthy.

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,959
yeah these are great i'll never remember

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,320
what these are though

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,320
aspiring oh you lost focus

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,839
claw there we go uh the command

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,360
semicolon is something i never type so

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
like hats off to you for figuring out

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,959
another command because

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
i have to look down to think about it so

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
hopefully that'll be muscle memory by

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,120
this weekend

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
and if you want to change that you can

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
change that in the help menu there's a

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,079
change

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:47,440
shortcut for scripts and the main menu

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,440
so right here if you say await

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:56,800
space npm and then this

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
npm is a function and pass in a string

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,360
of

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,399
sharp or some library you'd use um

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,040
sure sharp i've never actually used that

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,800
one

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,160
it's that's the image processing library

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,800
okay

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,800
um so if you just run this right now

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,040
um so it'll say sharp is required

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,560
go ahead and it'll tell you how many

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,079
downloads it has

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,639
um nice and it'll go ahead and install

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,200
it

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,880
and then continue on with the script as

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
with sharp installed

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
so if you do on line one if you say let

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,959
sharp equals this then you'll have like

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
the sharp library

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,200
um

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,040
and every time now when you run the

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
script it won't stop you there because

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,519
now it's installed and then

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,279
um this this is another thing like

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,079
sharing scripts i didn't want people to

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,240
have to go and say

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,519
npm install this and if you install that

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,519
like in the script

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,040
it just says we require this require

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
that so we'll prompt you for it we'll

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,959
say

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,160
hey do you trust this and now you can

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,199
just start

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,560
sharp resize and sharp whatever images

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,399
on your your computer so sharp

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
oh but it's got typescript too as well

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
nope uh

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,440
you'll have to do there's a special type

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,800
annotation to get the

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,720
um to get the code hinting on this if

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,560
you want to learn what that is but

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,639
yeah i don't know if it's worth it but

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
uh a library i've never used before but

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
um

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,040
but this makes sense too and i love that

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,199
i can

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,959
have access to the full node modules to

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,160
be able to run scripts and

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,160
do some quick dirty yeah image resizing

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,959
uh vortex minus one vortex has a

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,360
question would it make sense to use

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,800
scriptkit as a local runner

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,639
i'm not sure what that implies now um

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,199
a local runner i don't know what you

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,720
mean by a local runner yeah

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,720
sorry if you could explain that

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
um symptorant has a question about

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
pending inversions

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,880
uh so with this whole um await npm can

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
you pin

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,279
different versions uh not right now i

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,360
could i could definitely add that in

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,800
um after after it's installed

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,959
you can always go back and um like

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
go into the package jason and manage

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,360
things

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,079
um and there's in the like it's

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,120
it's literally a node project yeah um

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,519
so you could actually run npm install

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
here right okay yeah i i i can see

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
pinning versions

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,160
inside of that npm helper being like

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,040
being a totally easy

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
easy thing to do yeah um and you can

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,759
also

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,360
from if you launched the app again

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
if you go over to help

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,079
and go down to manage npm packages that

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,880
you're

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,720
right on it um you could say uninstall

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,880
sharp like it lists the things you might

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,720
want to install or uninstall so

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,680
okay if

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,639
i go to manage packages and install does

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
it know

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,480
it doesn't know that i'm using sharp

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,480
anywhere

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
all right we'll try and prep for

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,079
discussion

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,880
all right so now github token is needed

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,360
which i

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,480
i do have oh no you're right sorry my

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
bad this does require

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
this does ask to create a just still i

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
was gonna remove i was gonna remove that

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,040
i just haven't done it yet

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,040
i'm sorry uh this is for kit

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,040
and uh i'm gonna assume repo access but

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,079
who knows no just just just just access

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,199
you can remove that all right it's a

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
muscle memory

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,240
yeah i was literally creating tons of

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,519
tokens everybody take note of the token

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,959
ghp underscore wyo yes commit that to

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,720
memory

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,399
um yeah no this that's bugged right now

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,319
okay looks like the share menu is

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,679
something to go and go in and fix

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,400
interesting okay what happens if this is

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,480
also

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,480
yeah so for whatever reason it's um

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,000
well it's taking the the share script is

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,280
looking for the script name

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,360
as an argument and it's taking uh

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,000
when it's waiting for the environment

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,960
variable it's

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,480
um it's replacing the the script

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,600
argument with the environment variable

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,840
essentially is what's going on um you

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,640
can you can try

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,120
just yeah right there if you just paste

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
it

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,520
in there

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,320
and maybe this is this is one of those

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
things where it works on my machine

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
because

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,360
all this is set up and sometimes i

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,799
forget like people haven't set things up

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,039
so now now it should probably work

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
um

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,039
yeah see like that's how it's supposed

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,480
to work but there was a there's a step

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
in there where it was

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,520
that i need to go and fix i need to like

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,320
clear up my environment

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
and double check some of those scripts

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,960
okay

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,160
um well cool and i look forward to

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
everybody who's going to be

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,720
creating generating just on my my github

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,679
profile

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
so you have enough at-bats at it to copy

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,280
that uh

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,559
or screencap that um you can go ahead

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
and you can do the prep for discussion

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,640
one now

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:34,000
i'll show you what this does

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,000
um share that one

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,320
so um it gives you a link to click to

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,160
jump to the discussions it shows you

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,440
where it just is and

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,240
um it's copied your

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,679
code as a js like markdown.js fenced

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,080
yeah

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,520
so if you just like open discussions um

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
you would create a new discussion and

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,720
just paste if you just command v right

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
now

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,080
nice um it just pasted that that all in

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
so

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,760
that is amazing so i could see this as a

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,720
really good use case of

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,240
um i want to create so what happens is a

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
lot of times i'll have an issue show up

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,520
because i do a lot of

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,280
uh i'm flexing right now but i do want

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,919
to live streaming on twitch

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
and i'll be working at a github repo and

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,919
find a bug

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,520
and i i will beg the chat to open up

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,120
issue because i know if i do it it'll

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,880
just be like

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,400
five minutes of me like silently trying

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,679
to type and spell things right

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,840
it's like hey can someone just open the

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,160
issue i'll clean that up if um

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,679
when it's done right so it'd be cool to

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
have like a script to say okay open up

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,200
an issue

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,400
on this repo and then that way and then

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840
assign b dougie

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
so that way he'll remember to clean up

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,480
the issue and provide more context

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
but yeah that's actually a great use

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,880
case of just to sort of create a little

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,480
sandbox to prep it for

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
um for copy and pasting

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
yeah and those should if you look at the

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,360
preview

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
um so you see that install aspiring

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,039
cloth

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,120
yeah um when you click that that should

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:15,200
open the app and say

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,200
um and try and install the script

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,720
so

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
i've got the i've got this one and then

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
i've got aspiring cloth

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,159
yeah this this pulled down the gist by

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
clicking on that link and put that near

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
her

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,400
and put that in here what happens though

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
if um it's i guess if you have the link

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
because i was gonna ask what if it's a

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,640
private gist but if you already have the

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,799
link you can see it

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,679
i believe yeah yeah yeah so not too bad

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,480
this is anyway um i'm basically i'm

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,679
going to be

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,919
asking you for advice and other ways i

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,360
can basically do my job next week

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,240
sure i'd love to help out this is uh

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,520
it makes me happy to see people removing

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
friction from their lives

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,440
yeah but yeah even like things like so

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,159
we have um in the tweets like we ought

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,120
to

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,760
you can automate uh these images um so

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
like i could see

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,200
myself just basically just grabbing

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,840
john's profile and then

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,280
slapping it in the uh the sigma template

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,679
or copying and pasting it

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,480
and then into the figma template is

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,600
doing quick

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,120
quick little scripts um yeah one one of

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,640
my favorite most favorite scripts i

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,640
wrote was one for

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
taylor bell at egghead he has this

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
scenario where

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,200
he's looking at a website and he wants

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
to grab the open graph image from that

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,559
website

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
and so i gave him a script that looked

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,960
at the current chrome tab

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,240
and then did the appropriate parsing to

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
find the open graph image

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,080
and then downloaded that image cropped

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
it to 640 by

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
480 or whatever he needed it for and

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,320
then put that in his clipboard

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,679
so he could look at a site hit it hit a

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,280
single keyboard shortcut

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
and it would give him that formatted

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
image that he could just paste where we

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
wherever he needed it needed it to go

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,280
that is amazing

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,919
and that's safe that saved him so much

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,799
time

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,240
compared to going to opengraph.com or

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,200
whatever it was where you'd find it and

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,840
download it resize it yourself and

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
like that that makes me happy yeah and

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,240
um

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,600
shout out to github who just shipped uh

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,400
new open graphic images for the

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
repositories

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
oh i've seen those they look great yeah

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
so like to be able to get those on

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
demand

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,559
um because yeah i've

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
i love having the fact that you have

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,280
little stars and issue counts or common

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
counts

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,799
in the open graph image regenerating

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,200
those on the fly would be

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,679
a breeze using script kit for sure

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
wow um love that example open graph is

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
that live

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,720
uh is it already i guess we should uh i

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,520
don't know if i've posted

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,799
that one i'll go find it well i guess

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,919
that's a good segue

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
um because i just realized we're right

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,799
at time too as well

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,320
um i was just so engulfed in this but um

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,559
where can folks sort of keep up the

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
dates and keep tabs on

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,679
new scripts what's happening with script

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
kit um

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,520
suggestions for scripts so so here you

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,080
go open uh

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,080
open the app

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280
go over to join type your email

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,720
that is the way this is the way

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,880
yeah there you go

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
