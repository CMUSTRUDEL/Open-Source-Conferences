This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 22nd May, 2pm AEST. We spoke with Gary Pendergast, one of the maintainers of WordPress. He talked us through WordPress and Gutenberg, getting contributors to your project, what attracts good developers, and even a little bit about working from home.
