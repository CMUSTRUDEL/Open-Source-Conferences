you are one of the maintainers of

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,159
wordpress correct

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
yeah all right let's talk through that

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,200
journey how did you come

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
to be one of the maintainers of

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,319
wordpress oh

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,959
wow so it kind of actually goes back to

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,599
before i was involved in wordpress at

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,440
all

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,560
uh i was working for mysql

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,560
um and so i kind of

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
ended up working there for a few years

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,440
and had a lot of experience and then

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:49,120
um then ended up working at automatic um

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,519
and kind of uh

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
um kind of started becoming involved in

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
in contributing to the wordpress

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
open source side of things as well and

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
then

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
it kind of became a thing that well i

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,920
had all this experience with

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,480
mysql and wordpress needed someone to

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,080
to look after that area of the code so

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
that kind of became my thing and it just

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
grew from there

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
and it's gotten better and better since

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,320
right

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
absolutely awesome i absolutely love it

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
now we have some great people in the

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,720
chat already

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
um just so the chat knows if you have

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,040
any questions

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,080
whatsoever about wordpress open source

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
maintaining

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
we're going to be covering a lot of

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,240
these things but if you have specific

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,639
questions yourself

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
we would love to hear them and i'm sure

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
gary you would love to answer them

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,919
correct

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,560
absolutely always love questions yeah so

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,680
let's talk about mysql for a bit so what

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,199
kind of i want to say like experiences

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
or knowledge what did you take

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,160
from mysql into when maintaining

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,280
wordpress

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,720
so i kind of um i

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,120
i was before mysql i was a

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
web developer generally but then when i

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
was working for my school i was working

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,639
as a support engineer

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,000
and i think that that kind of gave me

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,400
a lot of interest in uh like

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
solving solving the the real world

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
problems that people have the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
and often having to dig into some of the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,440
complicated

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,400
complicated ways that people use use

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
software

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,320
and so that bringing that

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
into into wordpress and wordpress is so

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
popular that there are just

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
a countless number of ways that people

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
use it that people build websites with

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
it and so

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,000
um kind of having that

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
experience bringing that to the

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
wordpress world has has made it a lot

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
easier to

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
i think kind of think okay how can we

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,720
build stuff that will work for everyone

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,520
now i'm interested to know in the chat

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,080
who actually uses wordpress here

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
um and whatever you use it for i myself

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
i have

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
two blog websites both of them gary

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
you'll be happy to know are using

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,280
wordpress

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,800
i also happen to be a journalist in my

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,360
spare time what even is spare time these

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,240
days

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,639
and we use wordpress um for that site as

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
well

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,400
and so i i think like it's just such a

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,520
great easy tool to use and so i have a

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,280
lot of questions

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,479
i'm still interested to see what other

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,680
people have but um ygdev already has one

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,360
question and we're just going to go

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
straight into it because

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
why not right twitch streams let's do it

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,319
so yg dev

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,120
says um at wordpress do you use github

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,319
actions and how are using github actions

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,160
so for context ygdev has been um

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
hanging around the microsoft build stuff

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,759
and saw a bunch of our

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,639
stuff we did on github actions and is

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
secretly

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
interested in what you would like to do

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,280
and how you use actions

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
uh we have started using uh github

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
actions

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,280
where we're kind of a lot of our um

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,560
a lot of our existing uh ci

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,479
stuff is on travis um but

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,039
we've been experimenting with actions a

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,080
fair bit in in our gutenberg repository

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,080
um and so it's been

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,759
pretty successful like the the folks

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
who've been building it have all

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,000
have all found it nice to work with um

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,039
it's easy to get things up and running

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,479
it's it's pretty cool yeah nice yeah

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,000
well i think like

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,840
i mean one of the things that github

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,919
right is we're very

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,240
brand agnostic we want developers to use

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,080
the tools they use best and so

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,080
you'll have a look like even like we

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,599
have integrations with travis cr and all

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
that kind of stuff so i think

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
you know it's just great that people are

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,599
being are able to use these kind of

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,840
tools to do what they do best right

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
um joy families in the site in their

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,639
chat as well as saying oh he's been

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
helping

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,319
beta test some sites as well um using

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
wordpress now

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,520
um tell us how i'm actually interested

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
because if i have a look on

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,039
um the website right now just

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
wordpress.com

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,120
it's saying that 36 of the web is

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,039
currently built on wordpress

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
um now obviously i'm using what for a

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,960
blog i've just mentioned i'm using it

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
for

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
um you know our journal articles what

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
other things

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
are people using wordpress for

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
i mean it's it's pretty wild so it's

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
it's

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,680
i think one of my favorite examples is

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,800
actually there's a um

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
a gaming company in new zealand called

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,840
game gamefruit

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,880
and they actually they like they do

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,640
um like a little web

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,959
web-based games javascript games that

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
kind of thing and you can make your own

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,399
games with their tools but all of the

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,560
back end of it is entirely wordpress

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,680
like it's all stored in wordpress

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,560
uh but the the front end is a

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,040
game editing tool that is pretty cool is

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
that

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
definitely the coolest thing you've seen

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
built on wordpress i think

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,360
i mean that's like the com that's just

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,519
the wildest thing of

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,480
so completely different to what most

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,240
people use

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
would use wordpress for yeah because i

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
mean when i think of wordpress i think

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,160
of

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
blog articles journal sites and things

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,040
like that i would

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
never have thought someone would build

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,240
like a game out of it

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
no less in new zealand do you have any

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,920
new zealands here

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,040
i like i like the new zealanders there

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,720
might be a couple of them

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
if they're coming from my chat i know

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,279
there's a few new zealanders that drop

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,399
into my chat

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,240
we have a bit of a ride between

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
australia new zealand now b-doggy's got

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
a question as well i'm saying you

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,920
mentioned

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,560
gutenberg what is gutenberg

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,399
so gutenberg is is a project that

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,920
started uh

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,040
i think about three four years ago um

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
and we were looking at just rewriting

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
the

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,839
editing experience in wordpress just

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
completely rethinking it

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,200
um and it it

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,040
iterated for for a couple of years and

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
eventually was released in

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,200
in wordpress 5.0 about a year and a half

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,360
ago um

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,760
it's uh it it's a big project to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,360
to rewrite kind of the central

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,160
experience of a content management

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,000
system

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,920
um and we were it's

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
we had to get it to a point where where

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,800
we felt that it was better than

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
the existing thing that was already

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
there

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,760
but it's it's gone really well it's been

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
um

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
uh we've of course been iterating and

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
improving it for the

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,279
uh since it was launched it's it's kind

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
of the base for

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,480
the mobile apps as well because it's all

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,079
built in react

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
then it can be compiled with react

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,080
native it's it's

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
been a really really good um

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,720
[Music]

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,399
experiment and ultimately ultimately a

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,920
open source product that

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,800
is transforming how how wordpress does

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,880
things

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,279
yeah nice now i've got a really good

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
question from the queue and i'm gonna

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,160
i'm gonna add a little bit to this

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
question because it's a really good

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,760
opportunity for you

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
um so the question is are you full-time

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,480
paid on wordpress

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,720
fox or somewhere in between so

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,839
my add-on to that is this is a great

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
chance for you to talk about github

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,399
sponsors

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,360
so i am

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,560
i am full-time full-time paid on

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,279
foss so i have uh

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,959
previously for for about the last five

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,440
years or so i was solely focused on

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
just on wordpress the wordpress open

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
source project

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
just for a bit of a change i've been

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
switching up to some of our

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,839
some of automatics other products which

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,360
are again all open source

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,839
um and but

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,120
uh yeah i i have been extremely

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,399
privileged to be

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,959
to be uh paid paid full time

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,760
for years to work on on open source

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,399
software

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
amazing that is so cool now let's jump

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
into

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
um a couple of things here so this is

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
um what i was shouting about before

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,760
which is you know 36 percent of the web

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,200
is built on wordpress

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,399
um yeah which is awesome um this is how

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
i found out like you know

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,920
giant stat in your face you can't miss

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,760
it now tell me what your

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,079
github is gary is it gary so it's pinto

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,519
pento how did you manage to get that

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,959
username

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,920
uh it registered very early like i can

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,800
get it on some

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,120
early i have it on some services i don't

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,279

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,880
don't have it on others yeah i love your

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
profile picture as well

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
yeah i can see obviously the orgs that

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
you've contributed to of wordpress being

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
a couple of them

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
uh what else have you got here uh more

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,160
wordpress open source maintenance so

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,000
you're part of the open source

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,079
maintainer community yes

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
yep would you like to tell us about the

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,600
open source maintainer community for

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,000
those who don't know about it

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
yeah so that's that's been a a cool

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,040
thing that github has been doing

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
for um engaging with with open source

00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,680
people who

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
maintain open source projects to to kind

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,519
of figure out how

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
what what things we need to be able to

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,760
to manage our projects better

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
um it's it's been really interesting to

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,680
see

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,240
uh what um what a lot of other projects

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,279
are doing

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
uh for managing particularly there are

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
plenty of other projects that are of a

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
similar size to wordpress so

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,399
seeing how they they've solved their

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
scaling issues is

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
is really really interesting yeah so the

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,120
open source maintainer community is a

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
group of maintainers as you just

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,320
mentioned and we we absolutely

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
love supporting maintainers because as

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,120
we know

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
like a good chunk of the world i think

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,639
it's like over 60 like

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,680
60 or something something crazy like

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
that right

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
um 60 of software is built on open

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
source

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,519
so by like supporting maintainers like

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
yourself and supporting projects like

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
wordpress

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,079
we're able to support open source and

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
continue to make

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
open source and software available and

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,120
sustainable

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
now as you just mentioned we provide a

00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
lot of really exciting things for you as

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
maintainers

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,040
um but what's been some of you you kind

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
of touched on it

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,760
but what's been some of your like the

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
best things you've gained from being in

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,040
the community and you kind of just

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
touched on it by saying you've learned

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
from other people what's been some of

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
like

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
the best part about being part of that

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,600
community i think it really is the

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
the people like it's it's bringing

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,160
together

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,399
a community of communities of people who

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,360
are who share whatever the topic happens

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
to be in

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,639
for like maintain for the maintainers

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,320
community it's

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,920
being an open source maintainer having

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,880
that experience of maintaining large

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
projects

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,120
for wordpress it's people who have used

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,480
wordpress or who

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,600
contribute to it or who build thing

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,040
build sites with it it's

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
that that whole thing of building

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
building communities that you can

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,639
uh where you can find people that you

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,600
can get along with and

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,279
actually um actually gain friendships

00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,320
out of it and that kind of thing it's

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,320
the the the tech is kind of just a it's

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
a it's a vehicle for getting there

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
the the important thing is the

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
relationships yeah definitely if we look

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
at the community i've just put it up

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,720
here on the screen

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
there's like over a thousand maintainers

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
in this community right

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,920
and i've done starts for i've been part

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,079
of communities and i've been part of

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,040
those types of programs before

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,480
and what we've found is um i've started

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
a couple of companies before but what we

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,320
found as founders

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,079
is it wasn't so much about the program

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,959
that were part of what the program was

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,839
offering us

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,040
it was more about the people that we met

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
and the other people who were going

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
through the program with us and that's

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
what i'm hearing from you right is it

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,240
you know it's not just about you know

what github is doing for you in this

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,720

where you can learn from them you can

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,360
learn from their top tips you can learn

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,920
from their experiences and their

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
mistakes and their wins and their loss

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,399
australia

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839

into it

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,720

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,920
primary hanging out is within the

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,880
wordpress world and then

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,079
um like i i tend to be a little bit more

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,199
of a lurker in the

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,360

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,279
very familiar concept to you uh like in

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040

it looks it looks the same thing yeah it

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,240
looks the same but okay even if it

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
wasn't

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,000

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
like it does like this is

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,840
australian team did tim tam slams live

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,760
on

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,280
nice that's the important thing you have

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
to really have to share australian

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,240
culture there

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,400
always the important team now i kind of

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,760
hinted at it before but

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
how much do you know gary about the

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
github sponsors

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,640
program yeah i'm sponsors i i saw it

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,280
launched but

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,720
i haven't actually dug into it kind of

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,400
by way of

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,320
being employed full-time already i

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,039
haven't had to figure out a way to be

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520
able to do

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,440
do open source and be paid is github

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,360
sponsors something you might consider

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
for wordpress itself because you know

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,840
you can have

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
organizations sponsored as well as

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,840
individuals

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,760
i did not know it that uh it could

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,880
sponsor you could sponsor organizations

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,480
um like a project right i probably

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
i shouldn't say organization because an

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,640
organization can do the sports 3 as well

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,280
but you can have a project

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,159
be sponsored under github sponsors so uh

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,159
if anyone

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,480
doesn't know about github sponsors it is

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,400
an amazing project literally

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
millions of dollars have been paid out

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
in github sponsors

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
um which is really exciting i mean

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,120
you're you gary as you just mentioned a

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,880
very privileged position to be able to

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,320
work full-time and work on open source

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,400
which is amazing

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
um lots of people aren't so lucky so we

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,960
launched github sponsors

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,679
uh to help people and to oh yeah one of

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
the things about

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
um maintaining projects and i'll be

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,919
interested to hear your thoughts on this

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,880
gary

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,640
is that one of the ethical things about

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
using open source is that you contribute

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
back right

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,520
if you use some piece of open source if

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,720
you've noticed a bug or a vulnerability

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,520
or anything like that you can

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,360
like you're kind of like expected right

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
to contribute back but not everyone can

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,159
contribute

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,159
drive results like so many people use

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,080
wordpress right so many people use

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,480
like i'm using obs right now to stream

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,440
which is another open source project um

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,679
but not everyone can contribute either

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,200
they don't know enough about development

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,600
or they don't know they don't have

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,679
enough time or they just simply don't

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,960
know where to start and so sponsors is

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
another great way for people to

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
contribute

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,200
um if they don't have um you know the

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
time

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
or the the knowledge to actually

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,080
contribute open source and this is one

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
of the reasons why we launched it so i'd

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,120
be interested to hear your thoughts

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,400
around that gary

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,640
yeah i think um i mean we

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
we live in a capitalist society so it's

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
it's people people need to be able to

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,400
make money to

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,520
to to survive and so if if you're able

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
to

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,120
um to help open source maintainers who

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,799
who often they've kind of been doing it

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
a lot of times just for the love of it

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,799
for

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,559
for so long um being able to

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,559
to sponsor them so they can they can

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,799
make it their job that's

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,679
it's a really really cool thing and it's

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,360
it's it's

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,880
kind of a good thing to do yeah and i

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
think it's like i mean it's now

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,120
available in 32 countries right

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,080
or 32 different regions and this was

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
something that when we

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,720
launched it we had some developers going

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,600
i can actually seriously consider

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,000
a career in open source now like i can

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
you know

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
because a lot of them are doing their

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
open source project was their main

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
passion but they obviously couldn't

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,240
sustain it without

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
income and so you see lots of people

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,440
used to have like patreon

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
um links or paypal links or gofundme

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,919
links or things like that

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,520
this is a way to like integrate

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,640
everything in and for the first year we

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
launched sponsors

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,000
we matched dollar for dollar every

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
sponsorship dollar that went through as

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,440
well

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,240
we're seeing a few people in the chat um

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,000
yg dev has sponsors enabled simon crop

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,520
has sponsors um

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,480
enabled um which is exciting so if you

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,799
haven't got it

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
go join the wait list um we're releasing

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,760
people all the time

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,760
the other cool thing about sponsors is

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,320
if you do the sponsoring

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
um either by your organization so your

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,159
organization could sponsor

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
or your individual profile can sponsor

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,880
as well um you get a really cool

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
um sponsorship badge um is anyone in the

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
chat

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,000
actually sponsoring someone so we can go

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,760
see what that badge looks like

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,760
i also notice you've got the very cool

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,360
arctic code vault contributor

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,159
badge gary i i mean i thought it was a

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,799
great idea

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,480
like my my code is finally locked down

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,400
the bottom of a mine in the arctic where

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,840
it belongs

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,320
i like it just like it's in the arctic

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,559
right

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,679
um yeah we'll chat about that in a

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,960
second um but b

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
too right

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,880
uh and you say yes b dougie is a github

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,640
staff member

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,559
yes we love you bee doggy you're awesome

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,600
b doug is actually one of my teammates

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,559
he is very very cool and comes from over

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,120
the uh it's top

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,880
secret that's no fair you can see b

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,400
dougie has like a little github sponsor

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,679
which means bw

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,440
um so if we had a look back at i'm so yg

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,880
dev's got github sponsors so let's just

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
have a quick look to show you what that

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,559
looks like

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,760
um so if you have a look this is

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,960
somebody who's got sponsors

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,799
enabled on their site yeah what's your

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,799
thing again this is yg isn't it

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,520
ah i can't type today

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,279
um that is not you

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,799
this is it this is yogi so you can see

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,720
like there's this badge that pops up

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,960
that says i can sponsor yogi

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,960
so that's what it looks like as a person

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
who is being sponsored

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,200
for b dougie who is a sponsor so he's

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,399
the ones giving up money he gets the

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,799
really cool

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,159
um badge there as well which you know

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,279
makes the profile look a little bit

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,880
nicer and cool

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,880
and you know it can kind of show off the

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,799
fact that you love open sourcing

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,279
contribute to open source

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,640
so yeah that's what we're doing now what

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,120
was the other thing you just mentioned

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,559
to me

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,320
about oh the arctic code vault so

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,000
yes so tell me how excited you are about

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,520
that while i pull it up because you just

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
said all your stuff is in the arctic not

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
everyone knows about the arctic code

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,600
vault yet

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,039
yeah it's pretty good like i've written

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,159
a lot of terrible code

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,320
in my time and so i think

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,600
putting it into into a frozen vault is

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,919
probably the best way to keep

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
keep the world safe from it yeah so if

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,399
anyone doesn't know

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,240
in um and again this doesn't show up

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,840
very nicely because i have dark mode

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,520
enabled doesn't quite work

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
but if everyone doesn't know in the

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,760
arctic we

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,640
as humans like humanity as in human

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,880
society

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,320
have what's called a seed bank which

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,000
means every

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,200
single uh species of flora

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,080
is stored in a frozen arctic vault

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,000
that if so for some reason you know

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
another media hits or whatever

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,440
we've actually got all those seeds

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,399
stored in a seed bank

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,039
so we can you know basically repopulate

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,840
the world with

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,039
plants and trees which is really cool um

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,279
and then

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,039
what we decide is github is like well if

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,520
there's a seed bank

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,320
why don't we have a code vault why is it

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,320
like we're storing the world's like

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,480
flora in case something goes wrong why

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,640
don't we store the world's code

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,799
if something goes wrong and so we

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
actually internally we found out about

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,000
this

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,559
at our company summit um mid last year

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,159
which was

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,279
very exciting for all of us we couldn't

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
say anything about it till it was

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,640
announced

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,640
um and now it was announced earlier this

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,840
year and anyone who had contributed open

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,600
source code

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,880
um so a couple people are seeing the

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,640
chat why they don't have it

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,760
but anyone who contributed open source

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,840
code prior to february 2020 this year

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,960
your code will be in the vault

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,399
in the arctic like in a literal vault in

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,520
the afternoon that's pretty cool right

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
gary

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
it's pretty amazing like it's it's it's

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,440
a it's a cool thing to do

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,919
to yeah it's a very cool thing it's it's

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,000
very

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,200
awesome like trust github to come up

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
with something cool like that

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,960
and so if you haven't got your badge

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,679
enabled on your site yet

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,279
uh it may take a little bit of time it

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,159
is still rolling out it's something that

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,840
only got released

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,640
very recently um so most um

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,640
there's a lot of

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,760
maintainers staff members sponsors who

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,919
are getting rolled out first

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,679
um and just i don't know how it works

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,520
whether it might be it might be to do

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,360
something with your like github the age

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,960
of your account how it's rolling out but

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,399
if you contributed to any kind of open

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,399
source pride of february

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,960
it'll be there it'll be there waiting

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,600
for you when you're ready

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,000
all right so we've got another question

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,440
um from my bank of amazing questions

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
that brian

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,360
gave me beforehand um is there a

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,039
wordpress foundation that takes care of

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,279
the funding of open source

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,480
things so yeah yeah so there's a

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,720
wordpress foundation

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,159
so the you kind of showed wordpress.com

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,799
before which is

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
the that's the that's kind of a hosted

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,919
version of wordpress that's owned by

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,080
automatic and that's

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,440
that's one of the the products that that

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,200
um

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,200
uh kind of makes money so we can keep

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,440
building things then wordpress.org

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,799
is the open source project and then as

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
you found showing the wordpress

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
foundation

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,120
is it's kind of it's a small foundation

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,480
that

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,399
mostly to do with um holding the

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,519
trademarks and that kind of thing to

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,279
to kind of keep them in a uh

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,880
keep them safe though the trademarks and

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,840
all that kind of thing were originally

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,159
owned by

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,960
automatic um but in order to

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,679
uh in case the company didn't work out

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,960
for example then

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,679
uh we wanted the the we needed to keep

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
the trademark

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,200
safe so and so they they were

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,039
transferred to the wordpress foundation

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,120
oh there's all the trademarks all here

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,760
and you can donate to the wordpress

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,559
foundation so we should look at getting

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,559
wordpress

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,399
sponsored as well give it another

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,399
revenue stream

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,919
so we can check it out yeah now there's

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,080
a very good question

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,440
coming from simon and simon is um

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,799
from australia as we just mentioned as

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,679
well from canberra and he's got a great

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,960
question

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320
and that question is it's actually to

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,519
both of us i'm gonna let you answer

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,720
first gary

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,640
um and that is are we working from home

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,480
simply because of covered right now or

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,039
is this just normal for us

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,360
i wanna let you answer first i mean it's

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,799
it's not really normal either way but

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,030
um yes i i always work from home uh i've

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,279
been working from home for

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,880
[Music]

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,880
i think about 15 years now like it's uh

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,000
i don't think i could go back to working

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,679
in an office the

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,760
the having to commute and having to

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,279
like wear wear a suit and all that kind

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,000
of thing like i wear a suit to look good

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,240
not to wear as a daily uniform

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,640
i like that i wear a suit to look good

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,919
not as a daily uniform can someone clip

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,159
that please

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,679
i love to put that like on a banner or

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,320
you know a sticker or something that is

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,200
great i love it

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,880
and so yeah like it's at least at least

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,679
kind of when or when all this happened

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,159
then

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,080
i i had the experience with the with the

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,760
working from home part but

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,840
also it's just such a wild time it's

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
nothing it it's working from home but

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,000
it's more like

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
i think a description i've seen is uh

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
trying

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,480
trying to work during a global pandemic

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,519
whilst also being at home yeah and i

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,960
think that is like

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,440
that's something i wrote a blog on this

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,200
a little um a few weeks ago but

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,559
people like oh this is working from home

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
this is what it's like and all these

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,360
people it's like

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,960
this isn't working from home this is

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,279
working during a you know

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,159
global penned or global crisis which is

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,240
a pandemic

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,480
and i've seen more colorful languages

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,000
there too but you're right we're this is

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,440
not normal working from home like i

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
don't be dougie right

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
b dougie works from home um as well in

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,519
the chat and

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,640
um it's it's definitely different yeah

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
people often have

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,919
um husbands or wives or partners at home

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,200
now

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,560
um kids at home um you can't go outside

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,280
in some countries

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,159
like it's this is not normal right like

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,240
i often

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,000
and to go back to the question like do i

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,280
work from home usually

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,280
sometimes right um i'm also just

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
noticing that my t-shirt just really

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,320
blends nicely into the wordpress

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,119
foundation so that's really cool

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,639
um but you know i i can work home from

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,800
home if i want to but i have a couple of

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,560
offices in the city that i go to i live

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,280
really close to the city so it only

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,280
takes me like 10-15 minutes to walk

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
um so that's nice but it's not just

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,399
about that like even on the days i

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,000
choose to work from home

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,320
i can still go out for my coffee

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,159
meetings i can still you know play sport

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,720
at the end of the day i can still

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,119
you know call up a friend and go see a

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,919
movie on a weekend like this is just not

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,720
normal

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
and i think not having that face-to-face

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,520
interaction like

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,560
um in different situations like again i

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,480
work in and i

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,240
i don't work in an office per se i work

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,440
in like a co-working space

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,040
um that i've been part of uh

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,960
due to my affiliation with startups and

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,320
things like that and it's just

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,079
like having that and just being able to

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,680
go in and just see people when you want

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,240
to like i'm not forced to go in there

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
right

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,760
i can just go there when i want it i can

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,400
have yeah coffee chats with people and

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,880
meetings and i'm not whereas right now

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
like

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,079
i don't really have a home office i have

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
a desk in my bedroom

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,280
my bed is this far away from me and

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,560
there's a wall

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,640
here here yeah

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,560
like i'm surrounded right like this

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,320
isn't normal like i want to get out and

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,520
do things like i have a tiny little

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,520
you know house so yeah it's a bit

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,280
it's a bit crazy and so i think that is

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,280
definitely the thing people need to keep

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,599
in mind when they're talking about this

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,040
work from home is this is not normal

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,520
working from home and even the people

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,760
who

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,040
like you gary and like me and b-doggy

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,760
who are used to

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,160
working from home it's still not normal

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,079
right

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,359
i mean gary how often do you travel for

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,400
work or for

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,400
i mean i a lot like

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
particularly being in australia then it

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,280
kind of it adds up pretty quickly

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,440
but i'll i'll usually be doing a hundred

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,560
thousand plus kilometers a year

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,760
of flying it's um

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,359
it's um but that's

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,359
not happening at the moment like i

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,000
they're like all of the major wordpress

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,400
conferences

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,359
have been cancelled all of all of like

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,160
the

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,880
like it despite automatic automatic is

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
uh

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,560
entirely distributed everyone works from

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,640
home or from a co-working space or if

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,480
they want to but um

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,320
we have team meetups and we have a full

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,560
company meetup once a year and

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,359
there'll be various other other meetups

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,800
and

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,800
but there's there's none of that at the

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,720
moment so even

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,200
even working from home i'd usually be

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,599
have some sort of regular

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,720
actual in-person contact with the people

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
i work with

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,119
um but it's everything's on hold i know

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,800
right and i think that's something

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,920
people forget like

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,920
before this i think i was home

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,520
like okay to give you some context i

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
turned i had my birthday party

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,720
or had a birthday earlier this year and

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
my birthday was in

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,720
february i scheduled my party for the

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,440
end of april because that was the first

00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,880
free weekend that i had um you know

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,680
amongst all the travel that we had

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,040
scheduled

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
um you know github satellite was

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,200
supposed to be in paris and we were

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,800
supposed to be

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,960
you know going these places we had our

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,359
team summits just like you said gary

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,880
and these things and so even if i do

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,160
work from home it's like oh i'm working

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,240
from home for a couple days before i

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,160
jump on a plane and go to

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,599
wherever for some whatever conference

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,280
right and i think

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,880
that is just so like what we don't get

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,880
being like working from home like

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,040
working from home during a crisis

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,400
like it's it's so different and people

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
just really need to understand that

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,640
i also love simon's comment in the chat

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
right now that gary you've got an iso

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,560
beard going

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,640
it's not an iso beard this is this is

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,920
standard everyday beard

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,680
i like it i like i've seen some crazy

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,920
things people are doing us so like

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,280
growing their beers or getting their

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,599
you know their partners to chop their

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,760
hair or crazy things so

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,000
so gary what's up with some crazy things

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
you've been doing iso first of all just

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
some crazy personal stuff you've been

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,160
doing that's not too

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,359
you know no no nothing higher than pj

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
and then just some cool

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,240
crazy stuff you've been working on for

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,440
work as well but let's start with

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,599
personal stuff first

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,839
i i think i mean i've got two small

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,760
children so a lot of it is

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,880
that how do you keep two small children

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,320
occupied

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
all day every day when they would

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,280
usually be at school or kinder or

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,800
something like that

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,640
so there there has been a substantial

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,359
increase to the amount of lego in this

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,000
house

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,599
um i'm i'm not going to lie i have

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,880
bought some sets for myself as well

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,000
which ones which ones come on uh i got

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,720
i got the new uh the new land rover one

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,599
which was that was pretty cool and i

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,680
decided to

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,200
to get some of their their powered stuff

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
like the remote control things because i

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,800
wanted to try

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
programming their their their stuff it's

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,240
um it's kind of weird but

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,400
it's cool it's fun to play around with

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,599
i've got my eye on the batmobile

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,520
the 1989 one it's that is huge

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,119
yeah well i do have this star wars

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,640
millennium falcon ultimate collectors

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
edition that i haven't started yet

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,960
because i promised my friend

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,560
that we're going to build it together

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
and i got it just before i saw and so he

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,200
hasn't been able to come over oh no

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,760
well maybe that maybe they should buy

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
one as well

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
oh that would be interesting all right

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,079
guys today we're doing

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,280
part 59 of the millennium falcon build

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,280
where's that piece gone

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
other things you've been doing

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,440
increasing lego i love it i love it

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,920
um yeah it's it's just generally trying

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
to

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,599
trying to trying to trying to have some

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,079
sort of routine

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,920
uh like there's no going to the gym or

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,760
anything like that so

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,440
um i ended up i honestly like the

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,040
the the one thing i found that worked

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,119
was i got some um

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,400
uh like um olympic rings

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,560
um and so i just hang them up on

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
um outside and i'm able to do some

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,800
bodyweight exercises on that

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,119
that gets me a little bit of exercise

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,119
but i have seen a significant

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
increase in the number of instagram

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,079
facebook and twitter ads

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,839
for home gym equipment like yeah i

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,359
haven't gone the whole home gym thing

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,280
like i'm not gonna

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
go and shell out for a huge amount of

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,319
weight and a squat rack and all that

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,880
kind of thing but

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,119
um i figured this will tie me over until

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,400
the gyms are allowed to reopen

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,560
so lego kids gym anything else

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,800
exercise have you been baking or

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:56,079
cleaning that seems to be

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,599
not more than usual like it's been a bit

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,280
of

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,440
a little bit of it but also like we we

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,720
tend to tend to cook stuff a favorite at

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,319
home anyway so

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,720
it's um it's not such a big change to be

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,079
to be at home nice all right now on the

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,359
work front now we're seeing lots of

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,200
people change

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,800
um you know the way they work or you

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,520
know their timelines or whatever

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
what kind of cool exciting or fun or

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,280
different things have been doing on the

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,560
work front during iso

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,319
i think a lot of um like a lot of it has

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,800
been about

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,359
just just making sure that people know

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,720
that

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,800
you know like we were talking about

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,839
before that it's not a normal

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,920
time so it's it's okay

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
if you're if you're not feeling that you

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,760
can be as productive or

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,119
it's okay if you need to you know

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,800
suddenly need to take the morning off

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,839
because

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,760
the kids need to be wrangled and uh or

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,680
you need to you need to have a call with

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,480
with the doctor or something like that

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,319
so it's um i think that's been one of

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,040
the most important things

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,960
um other than that like there have been

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,280
some interesting experiments already

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,480
because we don't have the the in-person

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,960
meetups then

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
we had one division that tried a try to

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,280
virtual meet up

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,760
and so i i think it went pretty well

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,119
like it

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,760
kind of it uh i i i was just

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,400
i was just observing quietly uh i wasn't

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,440
i wasn't

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,400
at the meet up but it was

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,119
um uh it was pretty cool and like it was

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,240
kind of a combination of

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,359
social time like using zoom or whatever

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,920
and also kind of like a learn up kind of

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,040
thing

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,440
people can present on whatever whatever

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,400
their particular expertise is and share

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,680
the knowledge around

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,119
and so it's certainly not a replacement

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,319
for an in-person

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,720
uh meet up but it's it's something as uh

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,560
to switch things up and i think that's

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,599
true right and let's let's touch on this

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,280
topic because it's

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,280
similar to the whole work from home

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,960
situation right and that's like

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
people say oh yeah we're never going to

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,480
go back to virtual events

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,560
uh to in-person events after this

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,319
virtual events are the way to go because

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,240
we've shown that we can do it we've

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,880
shown we never have to work in an office

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,040
again

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,160
and offices are going to change you're

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,520
shaking your head because you're

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
thinking you're you've got the same

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,280
thinking i do i think

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,079
so let's let's unpack that for anyone in

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,800
the

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
crowd who's just like thinking that way

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,640
or

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,280
hearing those arguments a lot the the

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,319
virtual events are they they're

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,800
certainly a

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,359
great thing to have but they're not go

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,359
they were

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,119
not going to replace in-person events

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,839
not going to replace the

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
because i mean you're kind of um for

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,520
people who do

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,960
attend events regularly then one of the

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,400
one of the most important tracks is

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,480
called the hallway track yeah

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,760
it's the the conversations that you have

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,800
with the people you meet it's not

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,560
necessarily

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
it's certainly you get to see these

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,920
these talks from really interesting

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
really smart people and get to ask

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,480
questions

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,040
uh of of people who know their stuff but

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,160
it's it's actually those those

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,280
serendipitous

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,960
uh conversations that you have just with

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,359
random people that you happen to meet

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,000
yeah and you can't you can't replace

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,560
that

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,520
with an online 100 right and i think

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,480
that was something that came out of

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,000
github satellite

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
like everyone loved it right they're

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,920
like this is great it's amazing

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,599
more people attended than obviously

00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,880
would have been able to usually because

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,920
it doesn't matter where you live you

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,000
could tune in

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,040
but for the people who usually go it's

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,680
like oh

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,440
well i mean i like the content i

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,640
probably saw more content than i

00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,920
actually do if i

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,839
actually go to the event but i'm missing

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
out on seeing the people and seeing my

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,400
teammates and

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,640
doing all those things i actually go to

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,839
physical event for and so i don't think

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,760
it's gonna happen

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,480
in future is it'll be a bit of a mix

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,079
right there will be a virtual

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,760
track almost for people to be able to

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
tune in from everywhere around the world

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
and have

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,240
all that goodness of doesn't matter what

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,599
time zone you're in or where you're from

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,880
or if you can't afford the flights or

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,200
whatever right

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,880
but there is i think that yeah that's

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,440
yeah i think you're right that has to be

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
part of it

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,200
that is that that will still be part of

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,599
it but it is still so valuable to have

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,440
that face-to-face interaction and i

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,520
i don't think it's going and i really

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,720
hope people aren't thinking along that

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,400
line of or whenever we're gonna have

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,079
in-person events again

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,839
because it's like work from home right i

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,000
mean you work from home

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,680
and i can work from home as well but i

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,040
have very strong opinions that this

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,640
isn't going to be

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,440
the way to move forward for every

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,119
company what's your thoughts on that

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,119
no and ultimately like we we're

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,680
certainly seeing that companies are

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,359
discovering that they can um have a

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,079
distributed thing like facebook just

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,520
announced that

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,359
they're they're going to make it an

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,640
option for employees to

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,000
to work from twit home did

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,359
a bunch of things like squarespace um

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,040
there was a few others that i saw listed

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,720
there's a heap of companies that were

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,160
previously 100

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,960
based in offices that have that have

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,000
realized oh

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,280
we can still get the work done with

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
people being at home

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah and so it's certainly i think

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,359
that's going to be going to become more

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,599
of a

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,119
more of a thing that people will be more

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,760
um

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,480
uh but more we'll be working from home

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,720
more and more

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,560
but then i conversely i think that's

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,200
going to increase the value of in-person

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,240
events

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,280
because ultimately we're as humans we're

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,000
we're social creatures like we we enjoy

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,880
having

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,920
contact with real actual people so if

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,280
you're not

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,040
if you're not working from an office if

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,040
you're not working

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,240
directly with people on a day-to-day

00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,440
basis then

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,520
you're going to be wanting to go to

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,359
events and and hang out with real people

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,960
i think so i think that's the key word

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,240
that you mentioned there right is

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,839
it's an option it's we we now we now

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,839
know we're able to do it

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,920
and i think being able to do it makes it

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,359
so much easier i mean obviously

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
you know we all work in tech right and

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,440
most people in the chat are gonna be

00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,119
working in tech

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,280
but i think it's a really key thing to

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,280
note for um government organizations and

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,280
things now government organizations

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,359
and stuff like that they often need to

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,359
work in an office right because of

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,800
the way things work but they now know

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,319
they can

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,319
work from home they have the option to

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,160
work from home so when you know winter

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,640
comes around and the flu season comes

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,200
around

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,880
people don't have to go oh yeah no i

00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,119
just gotta trudge into work today just

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,920
pop a few pills go into work spread it

00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,400
around ever

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,839
people will now go and the companies and

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,680
organizations will go

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,880
if you're feeling sick stay home because

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,000
we know that you're able to work from

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,160
home even if you feel

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,119
yeah like okay because i mean most times

00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,040
you've got the flu

00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,240
or a cold you still feel okay we don't

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,599
want to give it to everyone else but

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,599
people don't want to take

00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,119
sick days because they don't have sick

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,240
days left they can't work from home

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,920
because their

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,440
company isn't set up to work from home

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,960
we know that's a big thing with um

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,760
government organizations and big

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,079
corporates

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,800
but now they can and i think that's a

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,079
really really exciting prospect right

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,760
yeah i think i think it's really really

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,119
cool to see that i think though we're

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,160
certainly going to

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,960
when when kind of whatever the other

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,680
side of this

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,079
this endemic looks like arrives when we

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,680
get there we're going to end up with a

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,280
society that kind of returns a little

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,800
bit to how it was but there's going to

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,640
be some things that are going to stick

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,559
around and one of them is going to be

00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,760
exactly that that when people are

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,079
feeling a little bit sick

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,160
instead of either instead of either

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,720
choosing to go into work or using a sick

00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,000
day

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,520
they can just do their work from home

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,720
i just think it's going to be very very

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,880
exciting for us now i've got a couple of

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,319
questions on the chat sorry simon

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,440
we kind of we kind of got off on a

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,920
tangent but um simon's asking

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,599
um do you think during this time and i'm

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,040
not sure if you've noticed on wordpress

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,599
but you might have seen it elsewhere as

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,200
well

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,760
um do you think contributions and um

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,440
like like maintaining mainly

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,920
contributions but also use of open

00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
source

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,119
do you think that is increased because

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,160
it runs at home and people have more

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,000
time to

00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,319
free time i it's been kind of a

00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,400
a collection of extremes for it depends

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,720
upon the person like some people

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,760
of uh like have a whole lot more time

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,240
and they're able to contribute a lot

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
more

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,280
other people suddenly have no time at

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,599
all

00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,240
one of the largest factors i think has

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,720
been whether or not you have kids

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,760
just having kids at home all day makes

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,800
it really hard

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,599
to to be able to to do that and totally

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,559
understandable

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,839
um like it's it's it's a it's a really

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,359
difficult thing

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,640
um but overall i

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,480
you know i wouldn't be actually be able

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,359
to guess whether it had gone up or down

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,119
overall

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,640
um there's been some increases and

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,240
something decreases

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,160
i'd be interested to know from the chat

00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,839
if anyone is contributing more so simon

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,240
said he's definitely

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,400
been contributing more we've noticed a

00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,440
trend on github itself that there's an

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,960
increased

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,920
usage of github in a day like an extra

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,200
hour

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,760
um overall like in general and we think

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
that as

00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,200
a lot of it's probably due to people not

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,040
commuting so they might not be

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,480
working longer but they don't have like

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
commute time so they're able to do a bit

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,559
more

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,559
um yeah i'd be really interested to know

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,720
what um what other

00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,160
people are doing during this time as

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,599
well are you contributing more open

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,880
source i know some of my teammates i

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,960
know one of them took

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,079
a week off work and ended up just coding

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,920
for the whole week because

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,440
you know if you take a week off work now

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,599
what else do you do

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,040
you can't really go anywhere right like

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,400
you do all the things that you don't get

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,520
time to do during work

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,160
so i mean build more lego right yes

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,440
that's i mean sure that's uh you kind of

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,359
have to take some

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,800
take some pleasure time as well but it's

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,880
um

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,559
yeah i think certainly for folks who

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,599
folks who enjoy contributing to open

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,000
source who

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,760
and often like we a lot of wordpress

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,960
contributors are

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,599
not developers in their in their day job

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,599
and so their their open source

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,680
contributions are more of like a

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,640
a hobby thing that they just do because

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,240
they enjoy

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,040
enjoy their challenge or enjoy the

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,960
community or just enjoy being able to

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,319
to contribute to something well i like

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,800
that topic let's go with that

00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,920
so if you are at home and you have more

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,760
time to spare

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,839
how can how could people contribute to

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,559
wordpress let's jump into

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,599
um a website and you can walk us through

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,200
it wow

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,079
um i'm a new developer just right now

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,200
i'm just pretending

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,119
first of all you would you'd probably be

00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,520
on wordpress.org okay go to

00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,760
wordpress.org

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,040
yep cool so i've got some free time

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,559
today and i'm going to contribute to

00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,680
wordpress right now

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,400
you're going to tell me what i would do

00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,400
if i want and up up on the

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,599
up on the top menu bar there's the get

00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,359
involved button

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,400
get involved okay so for everyone who

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,599
doesn't have the link wordpress.org

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,599
uh then you would go to get involved

00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,200
which is so bad wordpress.org that's

00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:55,040
make.wordpress.org and that will

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,800
that kind of lists out the the

00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,240
the various areas where you can

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,040
contribute to wordpress

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,720
i think wordpress is a huge project and

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,240
it's been around for such a long time

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,079
that we're we're kind of fortunate

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,920
enough to have uh

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,599
teams that uh entire teams for the these

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,760
various areas within wordpress so

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,280
whether you're um

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,480
whether you're a developer or whether

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:21,520
you're you're a writer or a marketer or

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,960
a support engineer or you

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,760
you're a translator or you're a

00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,880
officer designer what else have we got

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,160
we've got

00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,760
video we've got training teams

00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,480
we we have uh a community just for

00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,559
just for people who host like the large

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,119
wordpress hosts

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,720
um this is actually what i love about

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,000
open source and i actually want you to

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,040
tell me what your thoughts on this

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,720
are gary um because a lot of people

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,800
think that oh yeah i need to be a

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,920
developer to contribute open source now

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,079
i often say like we know you don't even

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,200
okay let's just disregard even wordpress

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,760
just for example

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,920
even just any open source repo still

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,720
needs documentation done right

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,440
it still needs ideas and it still needs

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,000
like

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,079
you know people to think and come up

00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,960
with like cool solutions and stuff right

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,640
and i think

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,160
yeah going back to wordpress now you

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,880
guys have like really nailed it with

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,960
this like

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,640
okay yeah sure there's code but code is

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,599
only one of however many

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,000
two four six eight ten twelve fourteen

00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,160
that's

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,280
about 20 different areas that you can

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,520
contribute

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,960
on wordpress right and so you don't have

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,680
to be a developer this is what i think

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,920
is so exciting about open source

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,160
that's and that's that's something that

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,680
we've really found is such a

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,599
um such an important thing with uh

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,119
with managing an open source project is

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,440
that the

00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,240
the contribute like code contributions

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,160
are

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,839
they're such a tiny part in the grand

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,680
scheme of things like they're

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,880
important but you you need the product

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,440
to be able to

00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,319
to have the uh to be able to have the

00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,160
thing at all but

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:04,800
to be able to have the community but to

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,599
the work that goes on around that

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,079
product

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,280
um like that's the thing that actually

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,559
makes it a

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,319
community that people want to be

00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,520
involved in that people want to

00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,480
want to contribute to a hundred percent

00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,280
and in the chat

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,720
um both bw and yg davis talked about

00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,839
opensource friday.com

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,680
do you know about that at all gary i

00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,400
have seen that that's that's a really

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,400
cool initiative

00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,200
and have you used it at all i i haven't

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,920
i haven't i haven't used it like i've

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
checked it out

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,839
but i i haven't actually used it to to

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,319
find things to contribute to

00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:42,160
again like i kind of my job is open

00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,359
source so i don't really have a

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,839
lack of options but it's um yeah it's

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,400
it's a really cool way of finding things

00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,480
to

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,079
to contribute to so this is something

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,920
that i believe

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,160
b-doggy can correct me if i'm wrong but

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,440
i believe github actually started this

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,839
and now it's just completely

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,119
community-run so we started it as a way

00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,480
for people because norfolk you know

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,920
friday's the end of the week friday's

00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,599
the day you can often

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,520
sometimes get things done you know don't

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,599
commit to master on a friday

00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,720
um so don't commit to your own master

00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,079
can commit to someone else's master

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,760
and i think i like it yeah like that

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,319
yeah i literally just came up with that

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,799
then

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,319
you can have that one um yeah v doggy

00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,319
say actually came from

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,599
former teammates so this is before i

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,880
joined um

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,960
and they come with this initiative for

00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,599
people to contribute um

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,720
to software and so it's all over the

00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,000
world you can join in

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,400
whenever well on a friday and it's just

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,559
it's really great there you go progress

00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,440
loved by github and friends

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,160
let's have a look at all the

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,280
contributors actually which is really

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,599
exciting

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,960
um and so as part of this like open they

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,799
go look at it all it's crazy

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,000
and so as far as open source friday we

00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,119
thought we would take

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,480
um this to the virtual realm for days

00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,680
like this and so that's why i've got

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,559
gary here

00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,200
talking about wordpress on a friday

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,000
check out open source we've had um

00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,319

gonna have more people like this so if

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,280
you're a maintainer

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,720
um let us know if you're keen to do this

00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,359

probably a few minutes left while um

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,319
while some more

00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,000

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,119
some of your top tips

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,720
um for maintainers whether it's

00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,799
um maintaining the code yourself

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,319
getting contributors building a

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,960
community like tell us some of your top

00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,880

i think wow it's it's there are

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,839
even for like a solo someone who's

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,839
maintaining something on their own

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,720
um you want to automate as much as

00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,799
possible um

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,480
you'd like all of your tests you should

00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,359
have lots and lots of tests i know they

00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,440
can feel like a

00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,720
bit of a drudge to write but they are

00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,440
absolutely worth it

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,960
they will save your skin on many many

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,440
occasions

00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:18,400
automate everything and uh documentation

00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,599
and make your make your documentation

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,040
easy to follow

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,000
welcoming let people know because there

00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,559
will be people

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,720
going through open source friday or

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,559
however they happen to find your project

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,680
and they will they'll want to contribute

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,880
but if they don't know how then

00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,040
they might not do it uh but if you have

00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,040
a pretty clear guide of

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,559
hey here's here's our issues that that

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,400
are good for folks who just want to get

00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:50,000
started here's our good first bugs

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,760
um that's that's uh

00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,119
um that's an important thing having

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,640
having options as well for people who

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,400
don't just think about developers think

00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,040
about designers think about how you

00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,640
could

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,240
if someone is a designer and they what

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,720
they want to be able to put in a little

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,400
bit of

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,680
a little bit of time into your project

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,000
think about what are the things that

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,520
they

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,079
could make your project look better uh

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,640
think about what the documentation needs

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,480
what

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,920
what can you improve it's don't just

00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,839
think about the code i think the

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,000
documentation is just so important i was

00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,040
at a talk at rubyconf earlier this year

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,640
like literally one of the last

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,480
conferences i go to before

00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,040
shut down and one of the girls gave such

00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,359
a good talk on documentation

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,040
and how bad documentation or just

00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,119
incomplete documentation

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,400
can really just mess up everything

00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,359
you're doing so it's just such an

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,119
important thing

00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,559
now you did mention like community

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,160
building and stuff so

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,599
um each like project has its community

00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,920
profile right and

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,280
yep um well actually let's have a look

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,960
at the wordpress one

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,720
uh where's your wordpress on it is it

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,000
just github

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,440
uh github.com wordpress yeah

00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,520
and you can show me where your community

00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,640
profile is so it's 20

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:04,160
code and 80 documentation which is

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,799
hilarious i love that so you can like

00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,799
pin everything here you can like curate

00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,720
what's happening down here

00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,400
um you've got all these documentation

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,760
which is amazing

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,720
um how have you kind of curated what's

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,079
shown

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:24,480
um on your wordpress page okay

00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:24,480
so we we have um

00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:30,160
like the the the like the main

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,079
the main wordpress repository we

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,040
actually um

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,079
we self-host that so we we host that on

00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,400
wordpress.org

00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,680
and then we mirror that to to github so

00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,640
that's the wordpress developer

00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,480
repository

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,920
um and so that's however

00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,480
that's not to say that you actually have

00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,000
to use uh the wordpress tools you don't

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,400
have to develop patches we've

00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,240
we've set it up so that you can uh

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,079
contribute with pull requests on the

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,480
on the repository instead and so the

00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,680
pull requests just mirror back to our

00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,319
uh our infrastructure and the person who

01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,040
finally

01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,119
merges it will will deal with the little

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,240
bit of work there but otherwise

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,960
if you prefer working with github then

01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,359
or working in

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,799
like a github interface then you can do

01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,960
that you don't have to

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:18,640
deal with the some of the some of the

01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,559
more ancient processes that we

01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,559
we have just by virtue of being a very

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,319
old project definitely we've got some

01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,240
new cool things coming for github as

01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,000
well so on this community one here you

01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,480
can see an open source project right

01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,760
they've got their community profile here

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,920
which is great we're

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,760
rebuilding some of this so you can

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,920
create it a little bit better

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,799
and a little bit more you can show off

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,520
um

01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,799
certain people you can pin certain posts

01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,319
you can like do some

01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,160
really cool things now one of the guys

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,640
has mentioned in the

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,480
chat because he's been watching my

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,839
presentations during microsoft film and

01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,880
i'm interested to see if you know much

01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,720
about this

01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,720
um gary have you heard about our github

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,839
discussions here

01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,200
github discussions i i did see something

01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,400
about that but i haven't

01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,400
just been announced it's not even out

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,040
yet but i have it on my profile which is

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,920
cool

01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,440
um so i'm actually interested to hear

01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,040
from your point of view how you would

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,960
use this as a

01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,799
as a maintainer in your open source so

01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,520
um this is just a like a little repo

01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:19,520
that i built

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,280
um with just some info on the

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,799
sessions i was doing but the main one we

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,480
want to look at is discussion so i've

01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,520
got gotten discussions enabled on this

01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,760
repo

01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,359
um when this goes live in the middle of

01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,799
the year

01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,400
everyone will be able to enable

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,280
discussions so it's like

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,799
um it's just comes up like a tab so

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,559
you've got your issues pull requests and

01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,920
things on here and then you've got

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,440
discussions here and then some of the

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,960
people have been in discussion so you'll

01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,400
probably know this gary i'm

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,920
um you can give me an example if you

01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,480
like or just go in your head and just

01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,680
yell

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,520
yell down the camera about how

01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,520
frustrating it is um

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,720
the times that you've had issues and

01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,720
they don't turn in

01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,880
they turn into more discussion things so

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,760
issues were fundamentally built right

01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,480
to help productivity you would post that

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,480
issue or

01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,000
bug or something and people would post

01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,119
back how to fix it right or yes i'm

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,799
fixing it

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,880
have you experienced yourself either in

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:11,119
wordpress or your own development

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,440
those issues turning into long-winded

01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,400
discussions about random features

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,760
requests acknowledging people things

01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,720
like that

01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,160
of course and it's it's there if there's

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,760
if there's no other venue for

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,680
for that discussions and these kind of

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,599
discussions are important so

01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,920
if there's no specific venue for them

01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:34,480
then issues is kind of

01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:37,760
it and so we've certainly seen that um

01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:41,440
like wordpress we we have forums as well

01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:44,400
um and and we use slack uh for

01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,319
for uh general communication too so we

01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,720
kind of provide those other

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,359
those other avenues but that's also

01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,000
again

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,520
we've been around for a while and we've

01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,960
we can kind of set up all those things

01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,640
but having a

01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,319
just for anyone who's having an open

01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,839
source um

01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,160
who has an open source thing and they're

01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,359
they they're going to get discussions

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,400
and issues so

01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,760
having a place for them is is um a much

01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,400
better way to do it now you mentioned

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,319
having like

01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,160
all the slack and forums and stuff set

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,640
up and i was um asking people in the

01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,720
chat

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,480
when i was presenting yesterday if they

01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,000
had this issue and everyone's like

01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,000
yes it kind of gets to the point where

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,760
you go we should really move this over

01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,440
to teams or we should move this to slack

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,920
and you're like okay that's definitely

01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,559
become

01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,400
not an issue so what we've done we

01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,000
noticed that was a bit of a thing in um

01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,599
people using github and just

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,839
putting it as you mentioned in issues

01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,119
because no other another place to do it

01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,640
so i've gone with this new feature

01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,680
called discussions launching in the

01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,039
middle of the year

01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,039
uh it's a way for you to essentially

01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,640
just have discussions or conversations

01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,680
in github now it looks

01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,920
very similar to a if anyone wants to try

01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,160
it

01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,839
out this is open source on my repo so

01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,720
you can go in and start a discussion or

01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,119
whatever

01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,920
um but it looks like an issue so look at

01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,039
this one there's like

01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,640
31 um comments on it and it looks like

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,160
an issue so i can open up

01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,400
open it up just like i would issue but

01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,240
people can reply to it

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,240
so this one's a reply and you'll see

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,720
like nested threads

01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,480
um you'll see people who give you emojis

01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,400
i've marked this one as the answer so i

01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,039
can see here that's being answered

01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,640
so if you say you run a conference and

01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,280
gary i know you're running like meetups

01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,280
and things

01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,280
you might have questions from your

01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,200
meetups and go oh yeah here's the answer

01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,039
just like you would in a forum and i

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,480
think

01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,240
this is gonna be something i mean

01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,400
everyone who's seen it so fast like

01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,559
i think it's pretty good why do you say

01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,400
um check the last comment

01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,760
um it's probably just him putting some

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,720
stuff in there

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,960
enable code spaces yes we will do code

01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,319
spaces um that's another new thing we

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,680
won't talk about now but

01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:45,359
we think this is going to be a really

01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:47,680
powerful tool for

01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,880
um developers and maintainers like

01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,680
yourself

01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,440
to be able to have all that and like

01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,920
move it from an issue

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,440
into discussions and speaking of that we

01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,559
actually have that as a feature as well

01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,520
so you can actually

01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,799
convert an issue into discussion um if

01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,200
it becomes

01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:07,760
not an issue and vice versa you can

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:10,960
convert a discussion into an issue

01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,760
that's one thing we've got coming

01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,280
that's pretty cool that's pretty cool

01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,000
right are the top tips so you've

01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,799
mentioned

01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,240
um contributing you've mentioned um

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:21,680
getting involved in community we've

01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,119
talked about contributing if you're not

01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,119
a developer

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,720
and we've just talked about having those

01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,160
you know how to actually get started and

01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,480
we've posted those couple of links to

01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,280
get started

01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,799
make.wordpress.org and if you're just

01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,200
shooting now

01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,480
it's there so any other top tips for

01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,680
people before they go

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:43,599
um other top tips are testing

01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,559
um like if i'm if i'm like i might get a

01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,880
get a bug

01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,079
bug report or something like that on on

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,799
uh particularly on my

01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,359
personal stuff then it has nowhere near

01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,720
the

01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,559
uh the uh nowhere near the number of

01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:00,400
people looking at it that wordpress does

01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,799
so getting if i if i have a pull request

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,680
that i'll

01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:06,160
that oh i've done a fix i've done a fix

01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,880
for a bug in it and

01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,720
i think it works like i've written it

01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,240
how i think we'll fix it but i

01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,079
i um one of the

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,520
like i find for maintaining personal

01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,440
projects the

01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,960
one of the most helpful things i can get

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,119
from other people is

01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,799
them just checking it out if they use

01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,359
use the uh

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,720
use whatever the software is then see if

01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,240
it works for them and if it works for

01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,880
them cool that kind of helps

01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:34,400
helps to make sure that it's um that i'm

01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,280
doing the right thing if it doesn't work

01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,359
it improves it awesome i get so make

01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,119
sure you test everyone test just like

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,960
don't commit to master on a friday don't

01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,200
do anything without testing

01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,559
make sure you head into heading to pull

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,960
requests and

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,920
just check some of them out and and test

01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,960
them and see if they do what they're

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,039
supposed to do

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,280
does it do what it's supposed to i love

01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,280
that i've um just started doing some

01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,280
live coding on my streams as well

01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,640
and i hit the button to like compile the

01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,520
code or do stuff and you sit there

01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,559
you're like

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,559
is it gonna work is it gonna work

01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,760
and sometimes it works i get really

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,359
excited on stream

01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,520
and sometimes it just fails and you're

01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,520
like

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,440
i don't know i don't think i could do

01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,960
live coding like

01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,039
it's 90 90 of my coding is oh that's

01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,240
yeah i broke that oh i broke that yeah

01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,319
oh i broke that

01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,400
yeah all people like in the chat as well

01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,280
like oh you missed the semicolon there

01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,680
or you

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,599
spelt things so for me semicolons and

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,920
spelling things wrong are like my two

01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,440
big things why but things don't work but

01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,960
i'll tell you what's worse than live

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,799
coding

01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:45,039
playing wine sweeper on stream

01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,280
that is high pressure i've had people in

01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,039
the chat and like we got to like

01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,880
because we've been playing on 99 i did

01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,319
it for my birthday stream we went back

01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,319
to some old school games

01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,480
and people on the chat were just like oh

01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,079
we got to like the 99 and we had one

01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,839
bomb left it was two squares it was

01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,520
literally 50 50 chance

01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:03,920
and everyone's like they're like i wanna

01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,680
and we

01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,960
we messed it up i was like go again and

01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:09,760
one of the guys is like

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,520
no please no my heart can't take it

01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,400
anymore

01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,080
so um that that was definitely my i

01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,679
think i nearly like hyperventilated and

01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,400
passed out on stream because i was like

01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,239
i was so

01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,400
upset that we missed this mine

01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:24,080
absolutely but yes live coding on stream

01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,799
is also something that is

01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,400
um fun and brilliant marx just jumped

01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,719
jumped in the chat and said

01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,480
i'm not smart enough to do live coding

01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,199
people don't want to see me copying and

01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,839
pasting from stack overflow

01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,640
i mean to be fair like a fair bit of my

01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,560
day is

01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,839
like search search why have i done this

01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,000
wrong and

01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:45,040
i get us like a stack overflow answer

01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,560
like oh cool

01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,400
that's how i should have done it i know

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,839
right so tell me um

01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,440
i want to hear your thoughts on this

01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,000
gary like so i'm trying to one of the

01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,359
developers

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,759
at github a little while ago and he's

01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,920
like yeah you know 50

01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,040
of your development time is spent just

01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,520
googling

01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,440
i was like oh yeah i like that yeah like

01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,600
it's this is

01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,480
it's kind of like it's it's not so much

01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,759
that you're

01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,880
that you don't know what's your

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,480
you don't know what you're looking for

01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,080
you just you know what you're googling

01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,640
for you just don't know exactly what the

01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,640
answer is

01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,239
yeah just using just using google as an

01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,000
extension to your brain and like i'm

01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:21,920
like why not right it's a resource

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,679
that's out there and so here's follow-up

01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,000
comment to that was all

01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,839
all technical interviews should allow

01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,440
you to google answers

01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,440
and he's like well it's what you're

01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,560
gonna do at your job like what why not

01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,679
and i was like

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,440
that is so smart so if you ever had to

01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,839
interview someone for a technical role

01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,719
would you let them google and answer

01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,199
i mean at automatic we don't we don't

01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,799
have

01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,480
the like that kind of live interview

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,199
thing for technical parts like we do

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,880
projects

01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:51,359
we do project-based things there you go

01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,800
everyone apply for a job you can take

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:57,120
take your time um actually like use your

01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,840
normal development flow

01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,600
and i think that is that is like so much

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,320
better right rather than sitting someone

01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,600
down

01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,960
and being like all right solve this

01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,000
thing in half an hour and you're like

01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,320
well

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,239
okay like that yeah how often do you

01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,880
actually have that happen in a job

01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,239
like yeah sure you might go oh i don't

01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,840
know you've probably heard this up

01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,760
or maybe not but bullies heard of it

01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,440
well gary wordpress is down fix it and

01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,280
you're like cool call everyone

01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,719
in the team let's work this out you

01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,360
can't work it out together as a team

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,800
right

01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,960
but i don't think there's ever a time

01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,800
where you just like solve this thing in

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,560
five minutes and give you a perfect

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,159
answer with you know the exact lines of

01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,400
code you need with all the comments in

01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,000
it

01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,159
and be flaws and it has to work before

01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,840
you even test it it's like yeah that's

01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:40,159
that's never going to happen in real

01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,880
life so why would you include that in an

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,960
interview

01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,640
yeah and i think martin said too like

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,080
hiring by google's

01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,080
google photos are good some people are

01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,440
amazing and they find the right thing

01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,600
and the reason i brought this up is

01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,920
because i was looking at a tweet today

01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,920
um from someone saying that um they

01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,159
often get pulled into

01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,360
technical interviews when they're not

01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,960
when it wasn't supposed to be a

01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,760
technical interview or get

01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,360
curled or yeah we're just gonna have an

01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,640
initial chat come in

01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,239
and then it ends up being like a four

01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,000
hour technical interview and like no one

01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,960
was prepared for it and they're like

01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,760
well this is you know not realistic um

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,560
yeah

01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,239
that's pretty rude yeah i mean i know um

01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,640
for anyone who applies their technical

01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,239
role

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,239
at github where you don't do the whole

01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:24,239
technical interview thing either

01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:26,560
there is a technical component but it's

01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,679
not the whole shoot down control

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,560
conditioning

01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,880
um and i love um yg's comment in the

01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,400
chat which is if stack overflow is down

01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,600
i'm dead

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,239
that's fair that's fair like i would

01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,760
assume

01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,679
you'd see that at github like if stack

01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,080
overflow went down then

01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,199
suddenly the number of commits on github

01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:48,239
would drop as well

01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:49,920
probably i don't know for the people

01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,880
who've been around for longer than i

01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,480
have

01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,159
has has there been a time when stack

01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,360
overflow's gone down and the number of

01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:59,440
github commits have gone down

01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,800
let's let's have a look at this let's i

01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,000
like googly things

01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,960
again we google answers right that's

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,120
exactly it that's how we do it

01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:13,040
stack over flow goes down

01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,360
let's see what's like i mean if it

01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,960
happens people would like oh here we go

01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:22,320
on february the 16th 2014

01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,960
stack overflow goes down programmers

01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:28,400
around the world panic

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,880
it's okay it's back up now

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,480
that's i mean yeah that's that's going

01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,000
to be the thing your stack overflow goes

01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,199
down then all you can do is just make

01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,199
memes about stack

01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,199
which is what has happened like right i

01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:41,040
have no idea what i'm doing

01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,800
i'm gonna stack over closed down well

01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,719
doubt might as well pack up and take the

01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,480
day off

01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,480
my career is on hold

01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,679
that's i like the honesty there yeah i

01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,520
know right and this

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,239
i came to work on a sunday and stack

01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,760
overflows down everyone panic

01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,080
and i like this they end up with don't

01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,640
worry the sights back up and running

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,239
um so if you thought you had a snow day

01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,239
um you'll probably have to find another

01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:09,440
excuse now

01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:11,600
so yeah there you go so cool um

01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,440
i mean if you're gonna work for another

01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,440
company or invest shares in someone else

01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:19,840
stack overflow is a good one because

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,840
clearly it's not going anywhere right

01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:25,280
yes it's it's it's an important part of

01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:27,280
every programmer's brain oh how does

01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,560
