Publication date: 2020-10-20
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 16th October 2020, 2pm AEDT. We interviewed Liyas Thomas from Hoppscotch, a fast API requester. We had the chance to deep dive into Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Liyas gave us top tips on building a project, promoting it, learning to code, and being consistent.

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
bit about what

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
hopscotch is what it does and then we

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,320
might do a little bit of walkthrough

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
with the audience before we chat all

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
about open source

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,840
yeah i'm sure i would love to so

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,400
actually

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
one year ago hopscotch started as a side

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,600
project it was a personal

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,320
personal side project for me and uh

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
you know you know uh one year ago i was

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
a student doing my final year graduation

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
in

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,680
engineering and just after my graduation

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
i i joined in a startup near my locality

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
and that's exactly the first time i came

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,199
up with

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,520
api testing tools and uh

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
you know there were there were quite a

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,120
lot of

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
uh popular api testing tools uh such as

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,320
postman

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,520
insomnia and a lot of cli tools as well

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,240
but you know being a front-end engineer

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,120
most of the time i i used to spend in

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
code editor

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,479
and the browser window and although all

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
the existing platforms were separate

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,560
apps

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,440
so i i just had a thought of developing

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
a platform

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,240
in which i could i could test my apis

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
from the browser window itself

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
and that thought is the reason why

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,520
hopscotch was born

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,479
and fast forward to one year we have

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,400
a lot of fuses from around the world and

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,680
it's going great

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,319
and also uh just like any other my

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
projects

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,720
i also wanted to open source hope scotch

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,759
as well

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
and you know over the past few few

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
months

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,440
few years we have crossed around 100

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,000
plus contributors from around the world

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,600
it's it's going great it's getting a lot

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
of traction

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,280
that's that's that's how hopscotch

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,199
respond yeah

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,800
amazing so we're gonna jump in have a

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,720
quick look at hopscotch here's your

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,440
website here which i've obviously been

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
able to find

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,720
you can find on and it's really cool

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
so there's a whole bunch of really cool

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
stuff here now if i was a developer

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
working mainly as you said in a code

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
editor in a browser

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,960
if i wanted to go and use hopscotch

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,120
where would i start as a

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
first-time user to hopscotch where would

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,319
i start

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,000
okay so hopscotch is the

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:16,290
is the most simple and minimal

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,199
platform i like simple simple is good

00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,199
[Music]

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,479
you know get to know about the platform

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,800
we don't have a landing page

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,599
you get straight into the tool so

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,520
after landing to the landing page you

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,319
from the user side you only need two

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,720
inputs

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,720
one is

00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,380
[Music]

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,199
you just you just select the request

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,120
method from the drop down which is from

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,240
the request section

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,080
that's the one one input and you only

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,199
need another input which is the

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,240
endpoint the target endpoint of the api

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
you just type in or paste the endpoint

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,319
into the

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,639
url input and you just click send

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
within one or two seconds you know it's

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,759
as fast as you could

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,960
you get the response under the request

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
section

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,160
so basically that's that's the only

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,120
thing

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,840
that you need to you know spin up a uh

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,240
api testing

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,519
it's pretty easy and simple like as you

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
said you don't have a landing page you

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
just go

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
straight in and it's just like chucking

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
your method

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
throw in a url and click send like it's

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,560
it's pretty good

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,920
um well we've got actually a couple of

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
questions from the chat coming through

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
already

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,480
please chat send through your questions

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,519
i love asking the questions

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
um that you're here for it gives you you

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,120
know really

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
good sense of being part of the

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
community and makes you feel

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
i i feel like we we like to reward

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,160
people for showing up to live streams

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
you know lots of people can watch these

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,519
afterwards women were more beautiful

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
show up to live tree so we've got chubby

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880
freak in the chat

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,640
he's asking about why did you change the

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
name from postman hopscotch

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,080
got it uh so basically uh one year ago i

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
started the project with the name called

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,160
posthuman

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
and it's just that name actually came

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,080
out from the frustration

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
that i personally had with the tool

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
postman because

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
you know at those times i had a pc which

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,800
was around

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,839
10 years old and you know i i download

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
the postman

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,200
tool i opened it and literally crashed

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
my system

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,519
so uh that's that's how the

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,320
post woman name came up and after one

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,399
year

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,240
uh you know our development team we

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,120
really discussed about

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,920
you know rebranding to another name and

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,040
you know

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,480
like uh avoid any other future

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,120
obligations from the

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,959
postman company and you know we really

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
love what postman guys are doing

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,279
because they have built a very good

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,920
software

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,399
but yeah along with that we really want

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
to

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
make something for the open source

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,399
community and

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,920
the reason for the name change is

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
basically we really wanted

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,839
to rebrand the uh

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,800
project to another name and avoid any

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,040
future

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,839
uh maybe copyright infringement from

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
them

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,519
so yeah that's that was the basic reason

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,680
for the renaming

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,560
no i said i did just find your post on

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,279
dev2 from

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,320
5th of november 2019. so i've added that

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,200
into the chat

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
as well chubby freak loves that answer

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
but there's a whole lot of information

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,600
in

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,200
that dev2 post which you know yours

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
truly um lewis

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
has written larry you've written that so

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
go have a look at there's a whole bunch

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
of tweets there about a bit of the

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
journey of

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
hopscotch as well and how you launched

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
it

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,320
now let's talk a little bit about

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
hopscotch as

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,120
an open source project so if i jump into

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,279
um your github repo

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
and i have a look at hopscotch i can see

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,839
a few things as

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,839
a contributor right i can see you've got

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,839
108 contributors you've got um

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
let's see four main language or says

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,480
other but three main languages or two

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,120
really

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,519
view js and javascript fun fact i've

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
been

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,959
learning some vue.js sorry that's been

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
really fun

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,320
but as a first time contributor to your

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
project

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,399
what would you expect me to be doing as

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
a first time contributor

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,560
coming to hopscotch got it uh

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
so you know hopscotch is a project which

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,800
welcomes

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,399
every every kind of developers or even

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,639
not from the developers community as

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,519
well i like that

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,040
yeah so most of the features are built

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
on to hopscotch

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,399
were actually requested by the community

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,519
and

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,279
obviously made the community as well so

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,680
being the being the author or the

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,480
maintainer of hopscotch

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,600
we we really listen to what uh community

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
and for for a contributor for a new

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
contributor to hobscotch

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
what we always say is that if if you

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
could come up with an idea

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
or a feature that you would like to see

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,200
implemented in hopscotch

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,639
we we will help you to uh you know work

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,040
on the idea and

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
take it away next take to the next level

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
and implement it as a

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,839
future so for a first for a first comer

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,639
we always encourage them to have a talk

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
with us

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,040
you can use either our discord community

make really use of github issues as well

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
so first of all we we discuss about the

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,160
idea

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
what should be the essential features we

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,680
we don't want to broadway

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
we don't want a lot of announcement

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,279
features

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,920
built on to hubspot so the first thing

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,040
we would

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,440
do is discuss about the idea and

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,360
find out the essential features and we

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
will help them personally to

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,000
implement them and for a starting point

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,360
we always have an issues page which is

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,200

um you've got good first issues which is

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,399
one that i was going to ask about

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
and you've also got hacktober first so

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
let's start with good first issues

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,440
um this is something we'd like to talk

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
about on our stream

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
is it's a usually a really good way to

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,480
get first-time contributors involved

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,160
um so let's have a chat about good your

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,000
good first issues how you

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
come up with what are good first issues

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,839
and some of the top tips for people

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,959
coming to the project

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,760
god so basically uh

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,240
one year ago after starting off scotch

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,120
we

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,880
actually had one hacktoberfest we you

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,079
know we celebrated it as

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,440
as fun as we could and you know after

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,240
finding out the

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
finding out how tax works we added good

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,079
first issue

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,120
for you know to intend the newbies or

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,320
business to

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,360
contributing to open source projects

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,399
and we really filtered out the most

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,440
simplest issues are maybe like the

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,000
you know maybe fixing a particular ui

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
portion as well so we really filtered

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
out

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,199
issues in which uh a newbie can really

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
contribute to

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,560
you know we often found that good first

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
issues has

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,079
very complexity levels in some other

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
repository so

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,560
we didn't want that in our request so we

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,760
really filtered

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,920
the most uh easily doable

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,040
issues for good first issue as well as

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,600
oktoberfest

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
and it's really going pretty well also

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
so

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,399
after after one year we have around

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,199
100 less than 100 good first issues and

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
it's it's you know

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,920
almost off it has been solved by the

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,560
community not from the development team

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
and yeah it's it's actually doing pretty

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,440
great

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,199
yeah and i've noticed you're obviously

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,199
opted in for october 1st which is

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,440
fantastic so anyone here in the chat

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,040
that would like to contribute and um

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,720
make their contributions count towards

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,399
hector fest and more than welcome to

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,240
now i've got a couple of things from the

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
chat again i love seeing the chat so one

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,160
of them

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,680
is about a feature so

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,600
wanting to know if you can port it or

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
let's have a look what adventures you

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
want is to be a ported over to hopscotch

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
is the ability to generate code to

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,279
access an api endpoint

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,279
as a feature in postman now

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,199
how would you go about this firstly now

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,040
they're saying first of all that we're

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,519
not sure if this feature already exists

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,759
so

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,880
this is one thing that people find when

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,720
they come to

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,320
new projects for the first time is they

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
have an idea and they're not sure if the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,800
feature already exists first

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
so if chubby freak had this idea how

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
would you suggest

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
um specifically going about this in

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
terms of

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,440
working out where the feature exists and

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,680
then maybe implementing it if it doesn't

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
got it so whenever we get a future

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,800
request

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
uh we really discussed about the

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,560
feasibility and the

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
requirements of that particular future

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,320
request can you discuss that in

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,440
issues or in discord uh we

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,920
we basically use all of us for example

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
if the user came up you know firstly

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,800
came up in

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,040
detail issues we can't remember the chat

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
in there itself or if it came from the

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
discord servers

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,839
we continue the chat from on discord so

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
we basically make use of all of the all

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,039
the communities

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,959
yeah so yeah after after discussion and

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,000
iteration over the particular future

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
request

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
we we check the requirements and if the

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,079
team are

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
and you know it's everything is working

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,559
fine

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,280
uh being a car developer of hopscotch

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,400
me or either of my friends from the

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,000
development team

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
actually helps the particular person to

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,880
you know come up with a mvp

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,840
of the request and you know we

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
we again keep iterating that particular

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,600
request

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,600
and find out the optimal solution so

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,799
basically the contribution goes

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,120
around that maybe which is you know made

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,919
by the development team as well

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
so it's actually quite easy for a new

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,640
billionaire or a

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,559
you know meet like a medium level

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,600
developer to contribute to a particular

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,760
feature because

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
the entire development team will be

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,960
helping them to come up with an mvp or

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
something like that

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,360
yeah and do you think that's a good way

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,120
to practice your coding skills or to

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
learn skills and

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
well mainly vue.js and javascript since

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,000
that's what

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,120
hopscotch is written in actually

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,360
uh we you know talking about the stack

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,799
hopscotch is my first ever you just

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,440
project and yeah

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
the reason why yeah so the reason why i

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
choose

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
ujs for hopscotch is just for you know

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,520
just for laying

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,039
the wheelchairs platform because you

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,480
know before that i haven't done any of

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,360
the projects in blue jays

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
so i literally want to learn how you

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,679
just work so

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,080
i choose pjs for the landing purpose and

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,679
it it really has shown great things

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,799
because you know you could have i could

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
have choose react

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,520
or any other frameworks but uh choosing

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,840
ujs has really simplified the

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,120
development process uh you know really

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,520
minified the

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,880
time consuming creating a lot of modules

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,520
a lot of components

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
so the landing process is one of the

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,280
best thing that you could come up with

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
uh you know contributing to an open

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,480
source project wow that's pretty cool so

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
you as the founder

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,000
not just the fount not just the maintain

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,280
of hopscotch but the founder and

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,720
maintainer of hopscotch

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,400
didn't know how to write the main

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,919
language hopscotch was written in

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,919
until you started building hopscotch

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,480
uh sorry i didn't get the last one

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,679
so you as the founder and maintainer of

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
hopscotch

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,840
didn't even know how to write vue.js

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,720
which is the main language hopscotch is

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,240
written in

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,480
until you started developing hopscotch

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
i i never knew you just until i started

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
hopscotch

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,440
well there you go so anyone who is here

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,480
in the chat or listening into the video

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,919
if you want to learn a language

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
being part of the open source community

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,320
is one way to do it so as um

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
lyricist said and you know it's not just

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,559
you but the other developers on the team

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
as well

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,400
are happy to help people with their

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,080
feature requests and to

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
get you up to speed and actually

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,840
learning that language

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
i think is really cool so that's why i

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
love about the open source community

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,159
now in terms of like feature requests

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,240
and things like that usually it's on

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:16,159
um the the person requesting the feature

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
to make sure it's not already a feature

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,600
that already exists but how roughly how

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,000
many features

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,880
would you be like shipping or

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
implementing

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,679
say every month uh for every month we

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,559
we might actually ship around four

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,880
features

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,080
but that way it is you know maybe we

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,760
could uh

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,480
ship two or three features in a week or

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,360
maybe we go to an ideal mode or you know

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
spend

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,120
spend few times on refactoring

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
uh writing tests and all so in terms of

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,840
shipping features

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,880
uh yeah less than five i think so so

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
you're pretty active

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
basically is what i'm getting at right

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
like it's a pretty active community and

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
as i've said like there are plenty of

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,360
open issues

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,120
as well and if anyone wants to get

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,880
involved it's like it's pretty cool and

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,799
we've got some people in the chat too uh

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,799
resonating with with your thoughts and

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,720
sentiments and maxi chrome saying

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,039
uh the founder of the company they're

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
part of didn't even know code until they

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
started uh developing the you know their

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
product

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
as well and that's what i love about

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,960
coding is so many people just

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,480
have not even written any code in that

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,679
language before they so

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,919
some people haven't even written any

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,559
code at all when they start building a

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,240
product

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,559
uh so that's a really good segue into

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,080
our next um thing that i wanted to chat

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,000
to you about which is

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,760
how did you firstly how did you get

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,679
involved in um

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
coding and as a developer first let's

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,679
chat about that

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,320
okay so you know during during

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,799
high secondary education uh you know

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
after

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,840
after completing high secondary

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
education i literally had to

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,280
uh post my studies for one year uh due

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,159
to my financial backgrounds and all

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,840
so during that that period of time i

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,440
literally spent

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,559
365 days inside my home

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,919
doing projects study studying a couple

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,360
of languages

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,880
including javascript and you know again

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,480
i trading on my projects

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,760
making into a side projects or tiny tiny

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,200
products as well

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,039
so the the reason why i really got into

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,240
development is because

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,559
i found writing code or

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,960
making products being a creator is one

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,120
of the best thing that you can do

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
to you know improve your career improve

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,440
your personality

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
improve your skills so you know during

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,320
that

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
that period one year period of time i

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,799
really spent

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,280
uh you know literally days and nights

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,919
learning to code and making projects

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
creating

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
a lot of awesome stuffs that's that

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,559
that's that's how i

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,080
uh came into the industry and the reason

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,480
why i did that is i know i

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,080
i have been following a lot of great

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679
pestilence in twitter

things like that or uh well you know

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,760
as i mentioned earlier after graduation

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,120
startup near my locality and you know

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,559
after

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,159
five months i i got this uh job offer

lot of portions of by me coffee you know

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,880
really contributing to the creator

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,760
economy

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,960
so yeah by my coffee it's a creative

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,559
platform where

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,000
uh creators can accept one time and

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:45,440
uh recurring donation support

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,520
from their supporters yeah

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,559
it's really cool i quite like this i'm

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,039
gonna have a quick

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,000
i'll look a little bit more into it um

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,039
now you mentioned a fair bit about

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,120
your kind of journey into

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,200
being a developer can you talk a little

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,640
bit about your journey into open source

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,799
and why you started

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,679
a contributing to open source products

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,279
and then b

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
why you actually you did mention right

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,159
at the start that you wanted to open

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,320
source hopscotch

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,080
so um we'll talk about that but start

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
off with why how you got into open

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,760
source

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,400
and why got it so

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,400
after my graduation uh i have been you

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,960
know making a lot of projects

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,559
personally and most of them were like

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,200
tiny tools that would

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,000
allow me to you know reserve my workflow

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,919
because of my

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,559
development a lot of things as well so

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
uh you know most of the resources that i

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,760
found

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
online were open source so after

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,960
consuming that

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,279
i really felt i should be giving

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,520
something back to the community as well

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,200
and that's that's the reason why i

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,919
started contributing to open source

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
project

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,720
i i literally open sourced all of my

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,520
uh side projects in my github account

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,840
and you know looking back it's been

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,200
though

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,159
it's been one of the best thing that i

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,360
have done because i started getting

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,159
a lot of comments from the community

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,799
uh whether i should improve it i should

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
you know

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
concentrate more where i should be

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,120
focusing a lot

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,960
and so yeah that's that's how

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,640
i really came to the open source

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,440
community and you know i have been

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,720
working a lot of uh projects and

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,760
hackathons

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,360
uh those kind of stuffs and also they

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,880
they being ended up in open source

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,960
projects so

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
yeah one of the things that attracted me

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,320
to open source projects are also

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,720
hackathons as well as password process

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,600
yeah love hackathons if anyone doesn't

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,159
know um

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,919
a little about my background um i'm

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,039
called the hackathon queen

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
and i've done over 100 hackathons now

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,360
i'm pretty sure like i kind of

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,440
lost count after a while but i love the

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,440
concept of hackathons i love

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,120
people coming together to solve problems

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,320
to build things to learn from one

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,520
another it's just really cool

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,360
and i think you summed up really

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
succinctly there where you said like you

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,640
know you're working on all these

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,080
like projects and you were using all

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,159
this stuff and you wanted

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,919
to give back and i think that's like

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,640
that key about the open source

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
uh community which i love absolutely

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
love

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,600
and so you mentioned that you've open

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
sourced all of your projects which is

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
awesome

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,799
uh why specifically did you want to open

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,320
source hopscotch or was it just

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,679
i just want to open source it because

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
that's what you've done for every other

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,640
project

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,679
well hope school started as a it's a

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,960
personal tone

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,320
tool for myself and you know just after

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,799
open sourcing it

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,960
i found out there are a lot of others

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,240
who were in my current position

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
so the reason why i open such a project

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
is because

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,799
it was a it was like a habit for me to

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,880
open source the

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,960
open source every project that i make

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,360
and after open sourcing the project

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
after getting the traction uh you know

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,159
it really helped me because

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,039
i started getting comments on uh

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,520
future requests and a lot of other

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,440
things

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,039
which really helped me to you know move

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,720
forward uh

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,679
being the author of the project so

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,440
yeah that's that's the reason why i

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,919
often subscribe

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,640
so if we look at your github profile i'm

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,720
also curious where this cartoon

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,399
cool

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
i've also noticed you you are definitely

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,320
a fan of

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,440
cartoons because i noticed in uh your

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,760
hopscotch

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,039
on your landing page i think it's a

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,039
graphql

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,320
yeah the the um the example url is rick

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,559
and morty api

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,440
so i was shooting you a bit of a cartoon

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,919
buff right

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,559
i i really love and i just fell in love

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,000
with

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,640
uh emojis and oh that's so that's

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,919
that's quite obvious yeah i like it i

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,519
really like it which is where you get

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
all these really cool animations and

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,440
things from

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,120
as well um now but we slightly went off

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,080
track but that's fine i like going off

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,440
track in these

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,200
conversations it means we're having a

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,720
great conversation so we have a look at

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,840
your github profile

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,120
and we have a look at your pinned um

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,440
like your pin project

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,799
obviously you've got hopscotch there um

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,559
some of the other ones these are all

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,679

yes that those were my uh you know

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,039
started as a personal project and right

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,559
now being

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,480
you know actually maintained by the

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,279
community yeah that's that's all my

00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
projects yeah

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720

mark down so the c um built with love by

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
you and your contributors and you've

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,279
obviously got a thing for unicorns as

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,600
well i think this is uh

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,120
hilarious some of your unicorn emojis

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,960
but yeah markdown

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,960
viewer and editor and yeah as you said

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,039
now the community is maintaining this um

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,600
i love the readme profiles

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,200
um also the the readme files so don't

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,640
forget everyone read me profiles are

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,279
really really helpful

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,159
um for people so that is amazing and

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,600
i've just

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,200
checked out your contribution graph

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,640
you've literally well

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,360
you've barely missed a day of

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,279
contributing

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,240
i think i can probably count the number

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,760
of blank squares on my two hands wonder

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,240
if anyone else in the chat has

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:52,240
has a contribution graph quite like that

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,240
wow that's very very impressive

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,880
you know it's so part of you know

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,320
improving myself so

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,080
i really love contributing to open

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,600
source strategies yeah and that's what i

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,960
wanted to have a chat about next

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,799
is that you know you you love

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,159
contributing to stop you're clearly

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,000
passionate about it

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,360
um you've got a lot of projects you've

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,480
got you've built up a community around

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
you've got you know this beautiful

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,240
contribution graph here

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,760
what are your tips to people who want to

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
get you know

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,279
involved they want to be as amazing as

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,360
you are

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,200
developing they you know they might have

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,000
a gap year they might be thinking about

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
open source

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,360
they might be thinking about starting a

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,360
project what are your tips to those kind

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,720
of people

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,120
got it so you know just after

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,000
getting into the industry the initial

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,159
periods were

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,919
always tough you know it's it's quite

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,039
tougher than that you might have

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,600
i already have realized because you know

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,080
initial times uh my projects were

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,919
getting

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,720
literally zero amount of traction and

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
you know you you have to intentionally

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,360
uh promote your projects whether it's

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,279
your

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,480
social networking site or your peer

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,200
groups or

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
or the platform where you block you know

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,440
somehow you have to

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,600
uh make a little promotion from your

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,639
side to get the initial traction

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,720
and you know being a total newbie

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,399
what you have to always do is always

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,879
document the stuff that you are going

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,560
through

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,320
whether it's learning a particular

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,280
language or framework

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,079
or or you know tricky but that ever came

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,960
across

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,839
how you fixed it i would say always

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,879
document

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,679
your training and if you could also

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,079
write right start start writing blocks

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,919
uh

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,560
you know it doesn't have to be rocket

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,599
science but just start somewhere and

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,720
you know keep on going i would say the

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,159
the essential part of uh you know

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,839
being an open source project is the

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,480
consistency

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,000
don't stop after one or two projects

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,720
keep on doing projects keep on

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,280
continuing

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,800
and i think i think that's why you've

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
got three thousand four hundred and

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,400
eighty five

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,280
or eighty you know 58 contributions

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
right like

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,000
because you just haven't stopped yeah i

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,000
i never stopped you know i have been

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
failed a lot of times i have been

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,200
ignored a lot of times but i haven't

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
stopped yet

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
and i won't stop you know not stop me

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,680
anytime soon

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,599
we've had a few questions uh this were

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,520
uh well previous weeks and i know people

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,119
probably thinking in their head anyway

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,680
uh what are some of the kind of

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,000
platforms you can promote you mentioned

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,920
socials you mention a blog what what are

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,839
there specific platforms that you think

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,839
people should be promoting their work on

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,760
good uh so you know being a terrible i

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,680
can really give you a lot of speech

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,400
around this particular topic

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,400
but i would say is you know find out

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,040
where your target audience would hang

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,720
out

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,160
for example hopscotch is it's a

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,640
developer tool so

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,200
i actually spend a lot of time finding

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,599
out

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,240
well where my audience will be hanging

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,200
out

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,000
and being a developer tool i found a lot

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,520
of communities

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,359
such as uh subreddits on reddit

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,960
platformer developers would hang out

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,960
such as blogging platforms such as

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,119
devdo2

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,119
so basically you just have to do one

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,400
thing it is to find out

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,079
where your audience would hang out and

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,400
and just shamelessly promote your

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,240
project just say i just made this

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,640
project you wanna check out it

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,599
uh these are the features this is an

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,680
alternative

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,119
this particular project just have a lot

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,160
of other features than

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,520
the existing one just just just document

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
what you have done

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,200
and promote it that's it find out where

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,280
your where your

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,240
peers where your audience are hanging

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,160
out and

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,079
just just say what you have done yeah

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,000
that's it i love that shameless

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,760
self-promotion you've obviously done a

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,560
fair bit of it and if we

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,400
found that dev2 post so you know dev2 i

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,920
think is a great platform right

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,280
you would recommend that for developers

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,640
yes of course i would recommend

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,880
developing because you know while

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,200
starting in devdo2 i literally had

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
around 10 followers or something like

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
that and

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,440
you know after one year documenting the

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,480
progress of hope squash and my other

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,440
projects it's around

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,119
11 thousand followers in doubt wow

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,280
that's insane

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,240
um we actually just started writing on

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
dev2 as well

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,160
so all these uh open source friday clip

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,800
snippets things like that little uh

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,520
tidbits

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,240
of they're off they're all on dev2 as

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,160
well

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,160
um so make sure you go and check those

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,680
out people um and we have a look you've

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,079
got some really cool

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,760
um little stickers and badges i want the

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,400
hacktoberfest badge

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,359
on if i can um somehow get that onto my

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,960
profile i

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,640
only just started a dev2 profile um

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
this year so i don't have any of the

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,680
previous years oktoberfest

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,880
labels even though i've been in it

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,359
before but yeah it's really amazing

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,680
community i find here people are really

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,359
happy to comment on posts and i think as

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,119
you mentioned like consistency is the

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,240
key right

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
yes yeah nice and

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,240
what's it like we're gonna we're coming

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
towards the end of this but what's it

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,480
like

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,599
building up a community now you've

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,119
you've mentioned that you've got a

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,160
discord server

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,839
uh is that something you go and promote

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,599
shamelessly as well to build that

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
discord community so you can then

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,200
promote to that community or how does

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,359
that usually work

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,040
uh actually not you know building the

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,800
community is actually a

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,680
it's actually another side of uh

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,560
being a developer a creator because you

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,960
know

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,800
if you have turn up turn a project there

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,200
should be an audience right

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,240
and the commentary is not just an

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,760
audience but also

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,359
the part of your family for example uh

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,200
you know every community members in

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,000
hopscotch are

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,200
may not be the actual users of hostgatch

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,599
they they are

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,839
they are people who love the idea the

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,960
philosophy behind hope scotch

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,440
uh you know we have lot of lot of ways

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,079
to

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,960
move forward but still the community

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,920
members

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,640
really give their maximum to support the

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,599
project

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,839
they give their suggestions they give

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,599
how to improve the projects they

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,520
uh actually report bugs and all so

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,960
apart from being the user of the

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,440
particular project

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,560
community is something or group of

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,200
people

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,920
uh those who love the idea behind that

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
project

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,480
and whether it's you know making an open

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,359
source tool for apa testing

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,720
or literally contributing to open source

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,520
project as a hall

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,800
it's the community it's a it's a it's a

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,119
family it's a

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,640
group of guys so well we should solve

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,480
your project that's it

00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,079
i like that it's not something that i

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,480
really used to promote

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,760
i i promote where developers hang out

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,560
and i use community

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
to get the inspiration uh you know those

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,960
who support the philosophy behind that

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
project

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
so you use all the tools to like to to

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,200
promote

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
and build that tool and then you use

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,480
your discord community as like kind of

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
like your family

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,400
facebook chat if you will are you like

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,599
oh

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
wait were you all um yeah exactly you

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,240
all

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,000
you build one another up you support one

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,560
another and i think that's really really

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,720
cool

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,079
um now as we come to the end of our open

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,400
source friday chat with you

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,960
you've obviously done a lot of work with

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,440
hopscotch and you have a lot of projects

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,800
now that you've got that open source and

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,599
you've given us some top tips for

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,240
contributors

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,720
do you have any top tips for maintainers

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,800
that are

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,000
a building project maybe not just um

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,520
because obviously you've talked about

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,079
shamelessly promoting your work

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,720
but other other top tips to maintainers

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,520
around

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,160
you know starting up starting the

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,920
project

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,000
or anything like top tips maintainers

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,640
basically

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
okay so basically consistency

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,520
consistency is the

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,079
essentiality that you have to keep in

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,640
mind of and apart from that

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,000
uh you know you shouldn't be ashamed of

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,160
asking for help

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,040
because you know for everyone who's

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,240
starting as a

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,599
newbie it's quite natural to ask for

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,040
help and

00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,240
sometimes even me were ashamed to ask

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,040
for help because i

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,000
i you know of thinking what others might

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,760
think of me

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,200
so that's one thing that you have to

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,000
really get rid of

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,800
start start asking for help uh whether

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,079
it's in

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,800
uh stack overflow or your blogging

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,440
platform

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,079
you know or personally in twitter or any

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,319
other

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,400
any other place you can find help from

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,000
so that's one thing

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,119
and uh uh yeah

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,800
i would say open source or contributing

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,599
to open source projects is

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,839
one of the best ways to get to know

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,520
about the people around your life

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,839
you know being an opportunist system

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,880
being a developer it's quite obvious

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,119
that you don't have

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,560
you know a lot of time to spend with

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,880
other communities but

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,119
contributing to a you know community

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,240
driven project helps you to grow

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,359
grow as you know as personally and uh

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,640
in the workflow as well so it has really

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,359
helps to

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,319
uh you know improve your personality

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,720
improve your

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,440
career and a lot of other things that

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,359
came up with

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
open source strategic so do contribute

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,160
to openness project

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,760
uh be consistent and ask for help

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
i like that it's character building

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,560
right

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
yeah okay i don't think that's the

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,200
