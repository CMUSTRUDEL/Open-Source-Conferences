Description: 
	This is our VOD (recording) from the Open Source Friday live stream on the 16th October 2020, 2pm AEDT. We interviewed Liyas Thomas from Hoppscotch, a fast API requester. We had the chance to deep dive into Open Source; what it is, how to get involved, what the community is like. Liyas gave us top tips on building a project, promoting it, learning to code, and being consistent.
