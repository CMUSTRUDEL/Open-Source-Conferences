all right perfect um yeah my name is ian

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,720
um and i am one of the maintainers of

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,360
create react app

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,840
or at least that's why i'm here um i

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
also

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
contribute to node.js and a few other

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,640
open source projects

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
um and during the day i work at a

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,080
startup in canada

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,480
yeah sure um so i also started using it

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
um like very very shortly after it came

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,800
out

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
and i think not too long after that um i

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
had

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,480
contributed a couple bug fixes you know

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
minor

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,440
feature enhancements um so yeah i think

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
i got involved like pretty early on but

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,440
not

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,039
not you know too seriously

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,840
um and then it was around

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
it was after v1 came out v2 was in the

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
works

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
and i started working on a new feature

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
like a larger feature

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,879
which is uh we we allow you to import an

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,399
svg as a react component directly

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
um without having there are some tools

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
out there that'll that'll convert an svg

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,520
to a react component for you

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,600
we do that on the fly for you okay um

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
and so i ended up i think we tried like

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
three or four different ways to

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
implement that

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
um you know lots of people got involved

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
like dan

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
abramov and like ken c dodds and some of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,479
the babble guys

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
we were trying to figure out the best

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
way to build that

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
so in the end i ended up building like a

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
custom babble plugin for it

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,920
um and we we finally got this the

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,920
feature

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
uh merged and then i think it was just

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,000
like the next morning i woke up and i

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
had an email

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
from github that said you've been

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,520
invited to collaborate on the create

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
react app repo but there was no

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
i was like who sent this to me um there

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
was no

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
no like ceremony or anything it was just

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
just a github invitation

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,200
that is amazing um mainly because like

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,320
you started working on this thing and i

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
think a lot of times people try to

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,240
figure out like hey how do i join

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,119
your org or how do i join the repo

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,320
itself

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,319
uh and i guess it just comes down to

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
doing stuff i don't know if i could

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,959
sometimes i think

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
i think that's the best way right is uh

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
yeah just

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
just put up a few pr's um

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
maybe answer some questions in the

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
issues and stuff like that and if uh

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
you know if you're doing good work then

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
probably someone will notice and

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
probably they need help maintaining the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
project a lot of open source projects do

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
so i definitely i definitely think

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
that's a great way if people are looking

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,680
how to get started

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
don't jump in and try and do something

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
huge right off the right off the bat

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
the majority of the projects i build are

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,920
on create rack app which is also

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,239
something that i'm

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
uh i'm happy to have you on uh because

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
i've been not only a fan since the

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
beginning but also i've just been a user

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
since the beginning

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,920
now it's been a while since i create

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
created a new react app

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,599
probably at least a year since i created

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
a brand new one mainly because the ones

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,720
i work on i still need to work on

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,920
so okay yeah but yeah that's that's

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
um that's pretty cool they

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,159
it's an interesting project in that

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,239
sense um like our users

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,400
are it's a really diverse um crowd

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
like we have people that are new to

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
react um

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,360
sometimes due to programming entirely

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
that use it

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,560
um and then we have other you know more

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,000
experienced people using it to build

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,319
apps um sometimes for for professional

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,080
purposes um and then a lot of people

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,200
like it sounds like you

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,640
um or myself will use it

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,799
to just like bootstrap a quick like

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,040
experiment

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
um so i would say today there's there's

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,280
really three

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,400
core maintainers um myself

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,200
um another guy named ian schmitz um and

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,120
then another guy named brodie mckee

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
confusingly there's two ian's from

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
canada that

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,239
maintain create react app uh dan

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,040
dan stops by every once in a while to to

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
file an issue

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
or to you know offer a suggestion yeah

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
it looks like he's on vacation right now

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,560
but he definitely yeah with his

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,280
extremely large hat

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
yeah um yeah he's definitely not

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
involved in the day-to-day

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,079
um and then when i started working on

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,440
the project joe

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,199
there um timer um was

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
sort of running like the day to day of

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
the project

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
and so him and i worked together on v2

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,400
quite a bit

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
he now is one of the maintainers of next

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,040
js

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
yeah the few of the like the early

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
project was was created by dan abramov

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
and then a couple people from facebook

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
have some some early on commits they

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,479
they were kind of helping out too

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,680
yeah and um so i'm curious because

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,520
i wonder if everybody else is wondering

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
this too as well uh the fact that this

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
says facebook here

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
uh and you're a maintainer uh you didn't

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,919
mention any work at facebook so i just

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,280
want to make that clear for other folks

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,919
who weren't aware

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,120
right um and that's actually something

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,560
we're trying to make a little bit more

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,840
clear in general

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,639
um create react app was created by

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
facebook

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
yeah um but it's a community maintained

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,680
project these days

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,440
um no one from facebook gets paid to

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,560
work on create react app full-time or

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,919
part-time

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,560
um like i said dan will you know

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,320
file the occasional issue um or we'll

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
we'll chat sometimes and he'll have

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
you know maybe some some feature or

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,639
something he's he's wanting us to get in

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
um but that's really kind of the extent

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
of it

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
um and actually that's why we also

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,120
recently

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
just launched an open collective for

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
create react app

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
okay excellent that uh i guess that is

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,160
uh

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
create react app are we you know is it

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
linked here somewhere yeah there's a

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
there's a link in the readme it's kind

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,000
of near the bottom

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,360
it says uh supporting up a little bit

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,479
supporting create react app there we go

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,880
excellent yeah so that's um that's good

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
here yeah this is actually it's existed

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
for a while

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
um you can see we have some some

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
existing sponsors

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,639
um but we're kind of we've never really

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,240
we just linked it on the

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,680
the readme yesterday and we're kind of

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
making it official

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,280
yeah now okay excellent well yeah

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
you heard it first here folks breaking

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,520
news

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,680
um but yeah that's interesting too as

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,759
well so create react app

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
now it's it's it's definitely maintained

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
by folks outside of facebook you do have

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
some facebook employees who come through

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
and say hey

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,960
it'd be cool to have this feature and

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
facebook they help us with a couple

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,039
other things like i mean they do host

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
our repo

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
um you know we get some we get access to

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,639
github actions through that

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,639
um they designed our logo for us

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
uh they you know do some of our like

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
domain registration

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
dns kind of stuff so they help us out

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
with some of that kind of stuff as well

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,360
yeah and uh folks if you have questions

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
uh for ian definitely drop in the chat

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
i'll grab them

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,440
obviously i'm paying attention we fixed

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,080
our mic issues but

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,880
uh my question would be is it common for

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,639
folks to

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,400
like is this an on-ramp to become a

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
facebook employee like what's

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,240
like i guess like i don't know if it's a

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
hard-hitting question not meant to be

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
but

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
uh i'm just curious of like why not

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
create react app slash create react app

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,000
instead of uh uh facebook slash create

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
react

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
i mean that's a good question it the the

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,400
project initiated

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
um or started like you know life in the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
in the facebook repo

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
yeah um and so it's kind of just

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
momentum i would say is the answer at

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
this point it's kind of just stayed

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,160
there

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,199
but it wouldn't surprise me to see that

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
one day

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,560
yeah yeah because it's um

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,880
should you change the name to something

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,520
else and that's um

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,120
it's a it's a good question um i think

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
create reactive so synonymous i think

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
the um

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
i don't know if um because you're as as

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
you are

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,319
i was an early user too as well and

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,319
i think most people have taken that

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
create blank app

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
like right i'm not sure who did it first

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,879
but this is the first project i saw that

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
did this

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
that has a cli tool that sort of just

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
works pretty well

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
um but i think it's now like even create

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,000
next app

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
exists create probiotic app exist create

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
whatever app

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
um exists so i think that makes sense to

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,639
keep the name

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,440
that way but if you're getting like

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
action minutes

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,039
and you're getting support like design

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,360
help from facebook it doesn't make sense

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
it

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
honestly wouldn't make sense for me to

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,840
to move out of that sort of

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,879
structure yeah exactly i'm not saying it

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,520
couldn't happen one day but for the time

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
being

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,840
you know yeah they do give us some nice

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
things so

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,599
yeah like like you said those action

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,839
minutes those are

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
valuable yeah they are especially with

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,080
the

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,080
well in oregon as big as facebook like

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
they're obviously paying money to

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
uh have everything working uh but as an

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
open source project i

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
i've talked to a lot of open source

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,160
projects and they've hit the sort of the

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,399
the ceiling of

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
the action minutes just from sheer force

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,680
in contribution

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
right yeah and create react app is a

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
pretty big project we've got

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
you know quite a large number of of pr's

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
at any given time

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,760
so yeah and actually we we are working

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
on moving our entire ci

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,440
over to github actions so oh excellent

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
uh and i also wanted to point out you

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,560
mentioned you guys had a release

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,600
a couple hours ago uh oh yeah i forgot

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
to uh i didn't do i did everything

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
except for the github release

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,040
you can see if you want to see what's in

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,800
there um if you go

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,399
to the the changelog in the in the

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,839
root of the repo i just need to paste

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
that into the releases

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,680
yeah so that's uh i guess some exciting

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
news

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,120
um we we shipped create react app 4.0

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,360
um just about two hours ago

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,040
nice congratulations haven't announced

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,080
it yet so so this is it you're

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,279
the exclusive wow welcome everybody go

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,120
get your npm started and start making

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
some create react apps

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
yeah excellent uh there's a question

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,839
about react native cli

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,959
um i imagine that's the create react app

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,000
is pretty separate from

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,320
react native uh yes i don't

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
really know anything about the create

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
react native cli

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah yeah it's been a while since i used

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,240
react native even directly

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
last thing i did was um expo there was a

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,040
there was

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
create react native app for a while but

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
i think that's

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,880
i think they may have deprecated that in

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
favor of expo

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,279
yeah so can we talk about the benefits

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
of create react app

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
um sure of like why you would use this

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,480
over just you know

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,519
npm installing react sure yeah i mean

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,320
react itself is

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
not a framework so i mean if you if you

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,079
make a new project in npm install

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,600
react um it's not going to do anything

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,120
yeah um so there's

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
there's some setup work you have to do

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
to get a basic project

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,959
working which is like configuring a

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,920
bundler like webpack

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,680
um configuring babel maybe something

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,120
like webpack dev server there's there's

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,600
a few tools that you

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,200
need to configure and in the case of

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,800
webpack and babel

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,399
they're extremely complicated tools

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,880
and getting them all configured

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,399
correctly and working well

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,240
together is extremely difficult

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,720
and so if you're someone that's new to

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,200
react or new to javascript

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
you just want to learn react um setting

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,040
all of that stuff

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,320
up is is not it has nothing to do with

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,839
what you're trying to do

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,120
um and it's really frustrating yeah so

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,800
so the goal was um okay how could you

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,880
how could we make it so you can you can

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,839
run one command from your terminal

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,120
um and we will set up all of that config

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,560
for you

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,160
um and basically give you a blank canvas

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,519
with react ready to go yeah

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,399
yeah and that's um something that um

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,120
we can actually do here mpx so if i get

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,800
the

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
if i mpx i think i'll get the latest

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,920
that way i think so you can always

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,240
just uh do npx create react app dash

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
dash

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,079
version just to verify that

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,600
yeah if it's fetching from npm then you

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,800
should be good

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,680
yeah so i'll just do call this 4-0

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,040
and uh yeah i'll get a full-on react app

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
and

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
moments actually that was uh

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
that was faster then there's still a

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
little a little more to do

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
yeah that's right i remember the the

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,760
setup but yeah we can move back to here

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,920
while that's happening

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
um but yeah what i like about it and i

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
mentioned this earlier like this being

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
able to have a react app

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
uh with the like a bass react component

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,760
um i think if you still get the app.js

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,639
and you have like the spinning react uh

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
logo

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
yep um that's like pretty much most of

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
the projects

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,200
most of the projects i build are that

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
and i just usually

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
delete all that stuff and drop in some

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
like javascript to

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,079
showcase something or hook in an api or

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
whatnot

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,920
um but yeah i just i just been a fan of

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
just quickly throwing something together

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,519
for like a test or a demo or

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,200
proof of concept i do a lot of

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,959
interacting with the github api

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,320
so being able to have like a form or

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,519
something with the api

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,040
like it tends to be my go-to um

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,040
but speaking of go to i'm curious of

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,959
create react app i know we're coming off

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,880
of like things like hacktoberfest and

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,160
contributions but i'm curious of if

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,839
folks are interested in

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,480
collaborating and contributing like what

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,480
are the best ways to sort of

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,519
find pro like find issues to work on or

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
find things to

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,680
sort of collaborate with sure yeah um

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
i mean we we have a number of open

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,079
issues

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,000
um we could definitely use help

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,240
um triaging some of those issues so

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,360
that's a great um

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,199
a great way that people can help out um

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
you know if someone's asking a question

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,160
um or something and you

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
you know the answer or you think you can

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,680
help them troubleshoot it um

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
you know just jumping into the issues

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
and trying to help people

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,079
we also have github discussions now so

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,440
same we're trying to move those kinds of

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,839
things away from issues and

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
and into the discussions nice um so

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,240
that's definitely one way

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
i mean opening issues filing bug reports

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
and then

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,800
um you know like i said it's community

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
projects so

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
helping out other people in the

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,360
community if they're stuck if you could

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,959
help troubleshoot their issue that's a

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,320
great way to get involved

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,560
um and then beyond that uh

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
there's also i mean some of the issues

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,360
do require

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,959
fixes on our end so um opening up a pr

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:52,160
is also very welcome um

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,920
and i mean we're we're even looking for

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
uh we're looking for contributors but i

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
mean we're also always looking for

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
more maintainers as well like i said

00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
it's just the the three of us really

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
right now

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,600
um and so and we all have full-time jobs

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,600
yeah so

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,279
uh it's it's and it's a big project so

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,440
it's hard to keep up sometimes

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
yeah what's the um what's the process of

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,920
someone i guess

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
the last maintainer you on board is

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,279
there's only three of you uh what's the

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,560
process of someone sort of

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,560
becoming a maintainer because i think

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,519
that's a the question that comes up a

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
lot in my

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,120
my circles because i do a lot of work to

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
like teach people open source just in

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,839
general

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,279
um but like is it similar to you like

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,199
you just work on a project and then one

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,959
day you get an invite

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,480
yeah i mean i think that's the the best

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,000
way is to

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,320
you know start small um

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,560
find find a couple uh little bugs or

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,600
something in the issues

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,360
fix up a couple things like that then

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,800
maybe tackle something larger

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,560
it's definitely i definitely always

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,160
recommend

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,240
talking to the maintainers before

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
you undertake a big project every once

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,880
in a while someone will just drop a huge

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,040
pr

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,000
um with no sort of warning yeah um

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,399
and and i mean sometimes it's it's not

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
um

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
a direction that we want to go and so

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,360
you feel kind of bad because they

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,079
obviously put a lot of work into it yeah

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,120
i'm having to having to close it so

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
definitely

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,240
if you have something larger you want to

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
work on

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
um we have an issue type that's a

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,680
proposal

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,160
so that's a great way to start there you

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,560
could make a proposal say like hey

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,040
here's what i'm thinking about doing

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
um we can have a kind of a discussion

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,560
about it

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
um and then you know if if the

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,600
maintainers say

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,360
like yeah that's that's awesome we would

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,360
love that go ahead

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,440
then you know start working on it

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
um but yeah i would say like so start

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,199
with a couple small changes

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,199
you know maybe work on a couple larger

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,199
features

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
and if if you're doing that and and

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,920
helping out um

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,160
you know helping people out on the

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
issues like i said and and

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,519
just being a all-around good community

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
member then

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
probably you know we're gonna ask you if

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,600
you're interested in

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,039
in doing a little more and uh and maybe

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,600
being one of the maintainers

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,480
yeah and i like the um a couple things i

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,799
like the the

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,160
proposal um the use of the proposal

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,039
issue i've not actually not seen that

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,079
before

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,480
um so yeah nice nice tip there and uh

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
i'm

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,199
i'm actually going to be looking through

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
these and seeing what people are

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,839
actually proposing

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,799
and see if i have thoughts that i can

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
just drive by and drop in but uh also

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,760
uh the thing you mentioned about

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,039
reaching out to maintainers uh i'm

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
curious like what that looks like too as

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,520
well just to make

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,600
make it clear for folks who like is it

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,960
at mention you on proposal issues like

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,280
do you guys hang out in the react

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,960
discord as well

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,320
um so yeah i mean you can you can

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,240
definitely

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,160
mention us um on github um like a lot of

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,160
people i i get a lot of github

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,600
notifications

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:59,360
so i may or may not see that

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,720
um otherwise we

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,400
i mean i guess there's the discussions

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
as well we did have a spectrum community

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
at one point but we we kind of replaced

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,320
that with uh with discussions

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,840
yeah um you can always find me on

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,880
twitter as well

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,360
um again i do my best to to answer

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
um don't always have have time

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,120
especially if i'm at work

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
um but yeah i would say those are a few

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,640
ways you can reach out

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,600
um you know yeah mentioning mentioning

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,559
us

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
on an issue is a good start and if you

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,960
haven't heard back

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
in a little while then you can always

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,799
reach out on twitter

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,640
um i don't really spend a ton of time on

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,440
the react discord

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,320
okay um yeah so those i would say those

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,240
are probably the two best ways right now

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
yeah that's um that's good to know too

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
as well because i think the

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,280
a lot of times and i get this with my

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,720
projects and like to be very clear my

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,559
project is

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
not anywhere near the level of create

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,039
react app so

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,640
um no one needs to cry me a river but um

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,880
what i'm getting at is i get a lot of uh

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
drive-by prs and people

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,559
submitting for features that i just

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
don't have i don't see that it actually

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,400
is valid

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,720
from the project i'm working on but also

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
i think couple does like typescript or i

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,200
want to change the way i do

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,559
winting which is like like thank you

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,760
very much for the pr but like i don't

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
think i'm going to change the way i do

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,679
hunting

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
right this far into the game um unless

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,960
the winter i'm using breaks which if

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,160
eslint is going to

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,919
die on us please let us know we'll

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,840
do a tweet and like people will jump on

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,400
to be maintainers but

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
um it's it's what i what i'm getting at

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
is like i like having

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,200
breadcrumbs for folks to sort of figure

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
out how to

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
like find me but also how to contribute

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
um

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
and i think one of the places actually i

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
jump into is a contributing md2 as well

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,760
uh so i was just going to jump in this

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
one and sort of get an idea because i

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,120
honestly have never contributed to

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,679
create react app

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,200
i say that but i don't i might have i i

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,919
honestly it's been so long

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,400
but um if you haven't you should yeah i

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,240
might have done a um

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
it might have been a dependency in react

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
scripts because i'm not sure but we

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,600
don't have to get into

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,960
how the project is set up yet yeah it

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,400
might have been

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
yeah i honestly don't remember but i

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,039
think i did something in react scripts

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,400
but

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
there we go uh but what i'm getting at

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,960
with the contributing md i'm curious are

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,039
there any sort of things that you would

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,760
want to point out to folks to

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,280
um that's the uh code of conduct oh this

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,360
is the code of contact well that's so

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,720
also good definitely read that too

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
definitely read that yeah because that's

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
important to you

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,840
to make sure um make sure you're

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
approaching

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,120
uh the conversation in the correct way

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,559
yeah

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
and we we've had really good luck with

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,080
that we have uh a pretty good community

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,640
we haven't really had any issues

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,080
there um so yeah the the contributing

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,159
guide kind of um

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
this probably is due for an update but

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
it kind of walks you through like okay

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,799
here's the

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,799
the basic like ideas and structure of

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,240
the project

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,520
um and then there's i think some more

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,039
a little bit more oh yeah like they're

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,320
like how do you uh how do you submit a

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,520
pull request

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,440
and things like that it's

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
it's pretty straightforward um honestly

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
as far as projects go it

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
really for the most part is just make a

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,760
fork

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,799
make a branch commit your changes open

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,440
up a pr

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
um there isn't we don't have a ton of

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,520
process around it

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,880
yeah well i mean that's good to hear too

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,679
as well because um

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
yeah sometimes uh you don't know about

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,440
the process until you actually

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,720
jump into it and it's always nice to

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
have this sort of laid out

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
so folks are familiar with it um and

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,840
then

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,480
the the structure of the project too as

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,760
well so like react scripts

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,200
and i've actually always wondered this

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
too as well because like i have a i

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
literally have

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
so this project is a project i've been

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
sort of

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,120
kind of dancing around actually in a

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,480
couple of these streams i always

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,880
mentioned it but i never actually share

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
it

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,000
uh but it's called open source i created

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,559
it

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,840
i think about four years ago uh using

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,039
create react app

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,000
and i've obviously already ejected like

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
a long time ago

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,480
uh so like i'm just using everything uh

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,919
directly and it's basically just a basic

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,640
react app that i got started really

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,760
quickly

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,039
um but what i'm getting at is this react

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
scripts like

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,240
are these meant to be updated as you go

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,840
along like

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
are these scripts only for when you

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,320
create react app for the first time

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,600
uh no they they are meant to be updated

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,640
and that's actually why it's a separate

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
package so

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,480
so i guess maybe a quick explanation of

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,000
how this works

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,120
the create react app package itself

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,919
is the cli that sort of kicks the whole

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,000
process off to create your app

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:47,039
and then it installs react script

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
as one of the dependencies actually the

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,240
only dependency in your project

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,720
other than react itself yeah

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,360
and then that's where for example you

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
know when you run

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,280
uh uh npm start or npm build that's

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
where those scripts live

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,600
um and all of our config um like webpack

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
and babel configures mentioning is in

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,720
react scripts

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,840
and so the idea is if you don't

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,159
eject um all you have to do

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
to upgrade to a new version of create

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,440
react app

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,880
is bump the version of react script in

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,480
your package json

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,880
and run npm and you're ready to go

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,760
really okay has that always been that

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
the case

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,960
yep okay so i just never read the

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,720
documentation

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,960
um that's that's the main reason why

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,880
um we discourage people from ejecting

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,760
yeah because if you do

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
that doesn't work anymore gotcha

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,000
excellent well

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,840
i've already crossed that bridge um but

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,240
good to know though because if in the

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,799
event i do create another react app

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,159
because i think react is um so if it's

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,240
not obvious like react is

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
one of my favorite libraries to to use

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
and it's sort of the backbone of a lot

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,000
of the work that i do

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,600
uh even at github but also just out in

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,640
the open and open source

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,159
um so like i i continue to leverage

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,520
these tools and i look forward to having

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,200
the opportunity to build a new app

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,360
and with this knowledge not ejecting

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
well and we've uh we've also over the

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,600
the last few years

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,720
added a number of features that people

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,919
did want to eject for yeah um so it's

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,559
hopefully less and less necessary these

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
days

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
like the big one for the longest time

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,360
was sas support

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,440
yeah which we added in v2 excellent

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,559
yeah and it's it's funny because this

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
the question i see

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,919
usually get asked on twitter quite uh

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,919
probably like twice a year

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
um but asking questions like why do you

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,120
eject i assume

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,360
yeah this is uh someone from the

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,799
community actually posted this

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,720
and was sending around on twitter trying

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,320
to uh solicit opinions on

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
on why people eject we also have the

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,960
there's this survey

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,400
um when you do eject at the end yes it's

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,520
a link to a google

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,720
form and we basically ask you like hey

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
do you mind filling this out and telling

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,520
us

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
why you ejected yeah so that was that's

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
where we got some of that information

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
from

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
sas was a huge reason so we added

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,799
support for that

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,039
um we also in version three

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,200
um we used to tell people you would have

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,720
to do a fork if you wanted to customize

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,720
the uh the templates

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
yeah so when so when we when we scaffold

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,120
an f an app for you it has

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
sort of a default template and you used

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,840
to have to to fork

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,840
if you wanted to make any customization

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,240
to that now we support

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,520
custom templates right out of the box so

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,520
we just we keep trying to

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,600
to find things that are causing people

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,279
to eject um and just bring them into the

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,360
project if it makes sense

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
yeah and uh so a couple of things uh

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
michael

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
de beau bowie um you mentioned that he

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,200
had a contribution and it was nice to go

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
through that experience so he dropped

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
that in the chat

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
he did yeah i was uh he he actually

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,480
helped out a lot with our uh

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,679
v4 release a bunch of the eslint upgrade

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,440
work which involved thanklessly making

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,200
prs in

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,360
something like six or eight um babel

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,159
plug or eslint plugins that we use

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,600
so yeah it was very good of him to to

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,320
coordinate all of that

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,080
yeah nice well yeah michael thanks for

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
joining us and uh in this chat too as

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,279
well

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,600
um and sharing uh one other question

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
from akash is um

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,559
supposed to suppose we want to add a

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,559
webpack loader maybe a svg loader or

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,960
something else like can that thing

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,919
happen without ejecting

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,840
no you so that you can't customize the

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
webpack

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,120
config without ejecting but

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,600
we do have an svg loader we just added

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,679
the support for avif the new image

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,480
format

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,520
so in that case i mean if you need that

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
immediately

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
then you might have to eject but if

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
something

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,159
in in a situation like that if you're

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,840
looking for

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,520
some kind of loader that we don't have

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,440
open an issue and uh

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,720
you know if if it makes sense we'll

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,720
consider adding it

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
nice yeah and uh folks thanks for

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,400
following the channel too as well we'll

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,480
we will provide updates and uh

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,320
notifications when we do go live

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,559
um but i didn't want to point out to you

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
for etz uh he he's mentioning or

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
sorry why did i say hey they uh because

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,039
your pronouns are not in

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,360
your handle um they were mentioning that

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,279
um can we explain ejection

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,640
because i think it was probably part

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,480
partially my fault um

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,399
i started bringing it up without the

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,480
explanation of what it is

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,399
we can uh we can show it in our demo app

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,399
right here yeah so

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,360
uh if you didn't see me do this earlier

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,679
i created a demo app using create um

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,679
create react app um so it's called 4-0

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,760
uh just for real quick uh we could just

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
run a quick npm start and show oh

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,840
do i do mp install i'm not in the the

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,399
actual app that's why

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,159
what happened there oh you're yeah you

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,320
have to change directory into the

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,520
yeah yeah it's uh it's i do a lot of

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,880
live coding so like

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,559
i figure out the error message just

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,919
talking out loud

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,399
right off the bat and i knew exactly

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,039
what i did as i said it too

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,640
um but we have a full on react app

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,960
working just from running that command

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,559
so

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,000
if you check out the documentation

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,039
create react

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,559
dot dev is uh the website

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,880
i think where you can sort of create

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,799
react app dot dev yeah yeah create react

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,919
app dev uh you can definitely learn more

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,919
about that and

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,279
get a better explanation of ejection and

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,640
everything we just talked about

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,399
so folks check that out uh but here you

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,760
can see my server's already started

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,520
um i don't know why i'm getting uh

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,279
you know what i'm am i already running a

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:49,120
server on this

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,799
well this is fancy oh there we go

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,159
don't know what happened there oh this

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,080
is beautiful it's actually a little

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,200
different than the last time i uh

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,080
i create react app um it's been a while

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
then yeah

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,720
yeah it has been a while um yeah

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,640
i guess it's probably been two years if

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,480
i if i'm probably incorrect

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
uh because i normally i leverage code

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
sandbox so i could probably go

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,120
look at a sandbox and see my last career

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,880
yeah they

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,399
they definitely support create react app

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,200
which is nice

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,679
yeah but for the context of x we have a

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,799
running

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,200
react server um or react app running on

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,039
a

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,440
node server and i just want to show

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,200
before i even do the ejecting that it

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
gives me a couple things which is the

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,200
source folder and then that spinning

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
logo that you can see right here um and

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
for those who

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,799
are not familiar with this and maybe

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,799
this is your first time seeing vim this

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,640
is them

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,559
but yeah i got the image here that's the

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,240
spinning logo that we just saw here

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,039
uh and then all the sort of context here

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,480
so ideally what i'm able to do now is i

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,120
have a react app running i get to change

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,720
the copy

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,880
i can add a couple of new pages if i

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,799
wanted to uh and that's sort of the

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,480
benefit of create react app i didn't

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,760
have to do any sort of setup

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:05,919
now if i did what is it yarn eject

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,520
uh yeah what yarn eject does is gives us

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,120
access to actually do you want to

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,720
explain this this is your

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,159
your product yeah sure so i mean so you

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,320
sure you sort of showed

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,039
um the the directory structure there

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,960
earlier um so you you just have a source

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,480
folder which has a couple react

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,080
components in it and then there's a

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,279
public folder which just has the the

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,640
svg of the logo um so if you

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,440
run this eject step um it's going to add

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,120
a config directory with a number of

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
config files in it

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,799
and those are things that they're still

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
there right now but they're

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,480
behind the scenes um so you're basically

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,399
saying

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,520
i want those directly in my project so i

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,679
can i can modify them

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,200
so yeah if you take a look at the the

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,440
directory now you should see some

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,360
additional stuff

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
excellent um there we go

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,320
yeah so there's that config directory

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,240
now there we go

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,960
and so that you can see that has our

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,480
webpack config webpack dev server

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,600
um some jest config yeah which is a

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,200
massive web pack model too as well

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
and i think the the benefit of this is

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,480
that i don't need to know what webpack

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,640
is or how to use webpack

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,679
in order to get a reactive site working

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,679
right

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,039
right that's why we we abstract these

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,519
details away from people

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,799
because from in most cases they're

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,360
probably not

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,519
uh what you came to create react app for

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,519
yeah

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,120
but yeah this is uh so yeah hopefully

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,360
that's let us know if that was a good

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,000
explanation of what ejecting does

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,679
um but yeah this gives us a little a

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
little more access to what's under the

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,519
hood

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,720
um but as i found out it does sort of

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,279
obliterate yeah there's a

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,480
there's a strong um there's a reason why

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,240
it prompts you

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
um and asks you if you really do want to

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,559
eject because it's

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
you can't go back um if you do want to

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,480
try it out it's

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,240
if you have like a repo and you've

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,159
you've made some commits

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,880
you can try ejecting and then just throw

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,159
that away and go back to what you had

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,840
but otherwise the ejecting process is

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,200
not reversible so once you once you do

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,960
it once you start customizing those

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,200
configs you're kind of on your own

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,320
yeah so that's why we recommend um

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,120
against doing it

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,720
and then if you don't like i said it's

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,039
upgrading is as easy as just

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,799
bumping the version number of react

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,919
scripts

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,679
excellent yeah and then for the you

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,720
mentioned too as well

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,320
the survey yeah yeah so

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,200
i will fill out the survey see if this

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,039
is useful for you

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,720
uh i won't submit this this is probably

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,000
not it's gonna mess up the uh

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,240
the survey results but yeah

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,840
um yeah curious what uh what else do you

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,840
have to share about the create react

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,480
experience um well we can maybe talk a

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,720
little bit

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,039
um about the new version of create react

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,640
app um as i mentioned we just uh just

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
released that a couple hours ago version

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,120
4.0

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,240
um so yeah maybe let's talk about some

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,399
of the uh what's new in that version

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,360
yeah when we find the release yeah i

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,640
it's not there um i forgot to do it i'll

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,960
do it right after the stream but if you

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,720
go

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,159
uh that's right the change log is where

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,760
change log yeah i just need to

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,360
copy and paste the change log into the

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,640
releases um

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,519
just for clarity change log 0x and 3x

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,480
these are

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,240
previous yeah so we we the regular

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
change log is is the current one and

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,080
then for yeah the three point x version

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
two point x version we keep the old ones

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,679
around okay excellent

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,559
um so yeah if you go near the top of the

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,360
of this there's a highlights section

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,880
gotcha

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,240
um so yeah these are some of the some of

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,960
the exciting new features that we've

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,519
added the first one is fast refresh

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,480
so that was some people might be

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,039
familiar with

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,039
hot reloading so hot reloading

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,279
as you're making changes in your code

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,760
and you hit save it automatically

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,679
um updates the app for you but without

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
refreshing the entire page

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,720
it's just that that component just

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,879
updates in place um

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,000
however that only works with class-based

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,800
components

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,079
and if you've yeah if you've been

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,599
following react for the last couple of

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,879
years you know there's sort of a shift

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,919
away from class-based components to

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,919
function-based components

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,720
yeah and so fast refresh is the

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,720
better version of hot reloading that

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,119
works with function components

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,560
so it was announced at react conf last

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,839
year actually

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,800
um and so people have been uh

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,839
some people have been working on a

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,760
webpack plug-in um so shout out to them

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,919
as well they've done a ton of work on

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
that um and so now we're using that

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,280
webpack webpack

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,359
plugin um to support fast refresh

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,320
nice and uh yeah i'm just curious uh

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,079
there it is

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,839
this is the the plugin yep

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,760
excellent oh and there's there's dan

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,359
again so

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,280
does dan do everything like what's what

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,839
is his role at facebook so

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,000
so in um this is a good example actually

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,720
in this particular case um fast refresh

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,680
was a new

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,560
a new feature that facebook sort of

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,680
created

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,520
um and so he sort of there were some

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,760
people working on a webpack plug-in

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,040
um create react app we wanted to to

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,320
implement it a couple other projects

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
wanted to implement it we weren't sure

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,440
if we were going to

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
build our own thing or then we heard

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,280
there was maybe this webpack plug-in

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,160
so dan kind of just brought all of those

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,160
people together

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,119
and and then we just coordinated amongst

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
ourselves and

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,400
yeah they would they would release uh

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,079
like alphas of the plug-in we would test

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
them out give them some feedback

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,480
um so yeah it was really great they they

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,240
helped out a lot

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,520
excellent so dan's like the uh community

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,040
organizer of the

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,160
the ecosystem yeah that's

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,599
it's interesting the connector yeah

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,000
because i i've obviously been in the

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,480
react world for a long time

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and uh seeing dan come through before he

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,160
was a facebook employee but also see him

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,480
and transition into uh

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,480
what this job is today uh it's nice

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
seeing him still be that connector

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,599
and still be sort of the lead on sort of

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,400
getting like the the twitter

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,000
feedback and updates i'm still waiting

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,839
for this i'm still

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,480
on the edge of my seat for suspense but

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,520
uh we'll see

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,800
um yeah and uh demise um

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,079
another question about react native and

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
i'm not sure if react native is just

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,480
like just generally popular with our

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,000
twitter audience

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,079
uh but i assume i don't know if you have

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,839
any answers for react native um

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,440
i probably don't yeah and for folks who

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,280
are familiar react native is uh

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
it's the way you could do sort of uh

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
write javascript to create uh ios and

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,560
android apps

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,000
um i've done a lot of react data in the

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,440
past have not done it recently

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,760
so i couldn't even answer any questions

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,720
today about it uh but definitely check

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
out the docs

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,160
uh if you do have questions about that

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,839
but um as far as the

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,040
the can you explain more because we sort

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,119
of uh breeze right by the um the class

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,320
based components and how react is moving

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,079
away from that

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,800
sure yeah do you want to talk more about

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,599
that um yeah sure so they

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,320
um in older versions of react um you

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
would

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
you would declare your components as a

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,280
class and then there were various life

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,720
cycle

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,400
methods like um did component

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,560
mount um uh or it's been so long i don't

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,119
even remember what most of them are

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
yeah we'll update yeah component did

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,760
update or

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,040
um and so you would you would write

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,560
functions in your class to hook into

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,920
those those life cycle methods and

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,119
a couple years ago they announced react

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,520
hooks

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,800
which is a way for you to use those

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,560
lifecycle methods

00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,400
in a function um and kind of since then

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,440
they've been pushing functions as the

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
the preferred way to create components

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,000
the

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,920
i know the react team will tell you that

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,359
um class-based components aren't going

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
anywhere they're not gonna you know you

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,680
don't have to scramble to convert all

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,440
your components to function

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,880
little components um they're not gonna

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,440
just drop support for them

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,640
anytime soon maybe ever

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,400
[Music]

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,400
but a lot of the new stuff they've been

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,000
doing seems to to focus on

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,599
function components and likewise like in

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,280
create react app we've transitioned all

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,359
of our templates

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,760
over to using function based components

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,839
and hooks and things like that

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,800
yeah and um actually i just set this up

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,040
too as well um

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,440
the so i opened up a vs code and this is

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,040
a this sort of functional component

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,119
and the beauty of like the react hooks

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,280
is that you can actually have your logic

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,359
for like doing fancy things i guess i

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,960
don't know what i'm gonna type here but

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,480
your you can have a hook to basically do

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,240
fancy things and then leverage that

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,640
separate so your business logic is away

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,800
from your sort of view logic

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
itself right and it makes it a lot

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,000
easier

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,520
to to compose or or reuse those hooks

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,240
like a hook

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,920
it could just be a function and you can

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,400
very easily just import that function

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,520
into

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,560
other components to use so they they

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,599
definitely have some

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,880
some nice advantages

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,800
excellent and i don't know if this is

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,480
public information but um or this has

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,640
been shared at like react conf i did

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,480
i saw your tweet about react conf um was

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,760
it yesterday i didn't go last year

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,880
um yeah i was i'm very sad to not be

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,800
there

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
yeah yeah and um i don't think they're

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,000
doing an online version either

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,440
um yeah so i guess as the the react conf

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,040
this year will just be um

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,359
updates and the change logs you can

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,880
collocate those unfortunately

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:53,520
um curious stats on folks who um

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,720
are leveraging hooks over um or

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,800
transition from hooks

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,119
from class-based component structures to

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,880
hooks

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:06,240
uh that's something that i don't have

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,440
but uh i bet the facebook team has some

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,480
insights on that yeah i can only speak

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,280
anecdotally like

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,160
i definitely know i see a lot of uh i

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,520
see a lot of

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,480
code being written with hooks a lot of

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,079
things being converted from classes to

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,760
to functional based components and

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
certainly all new

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,680
um stuff that i'm seeing um people are

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,960
writing with functional components did

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,599
you make the change i assume you're

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
using react

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,760
neo financial did you make the change

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,680
that um at their at the day job

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:39,440
uh yes actually we hooks came out

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,880
just before we kind of started

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,920
so yeah we we're definitely we're

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,520
definitely trying to leverage all of

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,720
those those new features functional

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,640
components hooks

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,200
the new context apis things like that

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
we don't do a ton of react we have

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,599
native mobile apps

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,160
um versus react native so our web apps

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,359
are

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,000
uh written in react but the our sort of

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,079
primary

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
customer facing apps are our native

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,839
mobile apps

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,359
okay interesting so i i just made

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,040
assumptions too as well that you were

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,200
just doing react at work and

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,800
they allow you to do all this this

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,319
contributing and maintaining of the

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,319
project but

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,680
sounds like that's not the case we i

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,079
mean we do use

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,760
um react for some of our projects at

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,040
work um i actually

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,079
i primarily work on on back end um

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,960
like node.js graphql um that's the kind

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,240
of stuff that i do

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,119
yeah um primarily in my in my day-to-day

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,839
yeah a little bit odd yeah i mean it

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,200
sounds like you're

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,119
you're doing completely different stuff

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,200
than uh what we just talked about

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,800
but uh right do you find that it's a

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,680
better balance

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,319
um i mean i like doing that for for sort

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,520
of oh

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,160
my dog has woken up um

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,920
i like doing that for my day job like i

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,599
like working on the back end stuff and

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,720
graphql is really cool

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,200
um but i definitely we do have a few web

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,960
apps

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,839
um and i help out with some of the

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,520
the i guess like architecture of those

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,520
since they're react-based

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,200
um and then also have a few like side

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,400
projects and stuff like that and i

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,920
use react heavily for those so

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,599
yeah it's not it's not necessarily a

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,920
part of my everyday work

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,800
um but i still use it for lots of stuff

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,960
okay

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,319
cool and uh yeah it looks like michael i

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,079
mentioned code sandbox

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,359
uh michael you are uh employee at code

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,079
sandbox um

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,839
but uh they refactored their stuff from

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,319
class components of functions

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,560
um and i guess hacktoberfest was a big

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,680
part of that too as well which is a nice

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,960
nice idea to i saw i saw a couple of um

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,480
a couple projects actually mentioned

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,599
they were switching to typescript during

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,760
hacktoberfest

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,200
and got a huge influx of contributions

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,319
that way it's interesting

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,960
seems like a big undertaking yeah it

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,440
seems like it

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,280
but i guess if you set it up properly

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,480
and have it on a separate branch and

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,839
just stop every all work uh the way for

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,599
typescript conversions

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,599
i joked about it on twitter said if i

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,440
open up an issue to convert my project

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,720
to typescript would you uh

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,000
would someone contribute i'm sure you

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,160
could find someone who would

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,560
yeah i mean people got time uh actually

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,280
i had a great uh hacktoberfest uh where

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,359
i

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
the majority of my bugs on my app um

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,319
because i have a ui

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,720
so the majority of the bugs actually

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,800
were squashed and solved

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,160
and now i'm about to ship another i'm

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,240
about to ship a new version

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,720
which is introducing another wave of

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,160
bugs because i just

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,160
right now once i get this last test to

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,400
pass i'm going to merge it and then

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,599
unleash it to my community and say hey

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,319
yeah so are you hoping people are going

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,599
to fix those

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,359
over the next seven days before

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
hacktoberfest is over that's

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
the hope is that they can at least open

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
the issues because i think what's

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,119
happening

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,000
is i i had a security thing anyway

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,640
there's a pr

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,839
about it and um i finally have it fix

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,000
it's been like

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,760
probably four months coming and i'm

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,280
going to ship that and

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,119
basically just ask hey could you just

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,480
use the app and let me know if you find

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,480
any edge cases

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,400
because i found i found one this morning

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,880
i was like ah this is

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,680
why it's hard to write code um write

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
code in the open

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,040
i miss akash's latest question though uh

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,640
about reloading

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,640
uh in class-based components not being

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,240
function components is there a specific

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,599
reason for that didn't work in

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,000
function based components in the hot

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,560
reloading um

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,319
so i it's been a while i don't remember

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,520
all of the technical details

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,520
yeah um i think it was uh brian d vaughn

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,359
who also works at facebook

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,920
um did a talk on uh fast refresh

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,200
at react conf last year where he goes

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,440
into

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,400
great detail about how fast refresh

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,400
works

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,599
um so if you're if you're looking for

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,119
details i would maybe

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,040
suggest looking that talk up on youtube

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,400
um because i i will not do it justice

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,599
yeah and i found he actually did a

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,079
podcast too as well if you're in the

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,079
podcast

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,160
did the sort of uh the circle around the

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,520
the uh community to share about this

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,000
yeah i would definitely recommend that

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,599
he'll do

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,480
a much much better job of explaining it

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,760
than i will yeah i wonder if uh

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,400
if this is a video it might not be the

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,319
same title but yeah

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,480
october 30th that's right around the the

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,400
time when uh react conf was so yeah that

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,200
probably is the video

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,839
yeah excellent and um yeah we were

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,839
actually

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,440
we i kind of got lost in the uh the

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,040
sauce and chatting with you

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,720
uh we have like roughly five minutes

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,160
left uh anything else she wanted to

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,599
cover and chat about that was on the

00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,560
list i think we um we opened up the

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,040
change log

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,800
yeah let's maybe just run through so

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,440
like i said we released um

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,119
v4 today so yeah we've got some exciting

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,160
new features fast refresh is definitely

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,200
the big one

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,000
um we have support for react 17 which

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,760
just came out this

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,560
week um including the new jsx transform

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,560
that it provides

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,760
um it's i guess i can click through

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,599
yeah again i don't know all the details

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,880
of how it's implemented but

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,160
like under the hood you know react

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,599
jsx turns into function calls to

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,119
something called

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,240
react create element and that's been

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,599
around for

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,400
a long time um and so they are

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,680
optimizing that um in the new versions

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,359
of react and they actually backported

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,400
the new transform to

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:27,200
to react 15 and 16 as well as 17.

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,000
nice um one of the one of the most

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,560
visible

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,359
changes that it makes is you no longer

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,920
need to

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,200
import react from react at the top of

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,560
all of your

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,839
components yep

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,440
there's obviously more to it than that

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,119
but that's that's the one that is sort

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,000
of the most noticeable

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,720
um so yeah we we shipped support for

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,760
that

00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,720
um and then we've got typescript for

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,960
support

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:58,319
um with typescript 4.1 um on the way

00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,119
um eslint seven just26

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,880
we added a bunch of uh improvements for

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,960
using react testing library which is

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,400
kensey dodds's nice testing framework so

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,880
that should be a much better experience

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,920
for people now

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,040
we improved our uh

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,280
service worker support that was uh jeff

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,240
jeff poznick from from google helped out

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,480
with that

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,599
so he made some big changes there and

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,880
we've actually split

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:31,359
the uh the pwa templates

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,960
um into their own external uh repo

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:37,599
so that means uh he's able to

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
to iterate on those um outside of the

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,920
the create react app

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,480
uh release cycle okay yeah cause i i so

00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,359
another

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,680
reason not to eject is um i updated a

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,359
bunch of my pwa stuff recently

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,800
and um trying to improve caching um

00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,240
in the browser for images and i'm now

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,079
making it up as they go along where i

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,079
could have just been like hey if they

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,720
updated the 4.0 i'd get all jeff's work

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,760
um

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,880
right for free so kids at home please

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,800
don't eject yeah

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,000
that's right yeah ask a lot of questions

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,240
before you eject

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,559
yeah yeah good that's good to know

00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,079
yeah so it was uh it it was supposed to

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,599
be oh and then that last one there we

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,200
added support for the web vitals

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,520
plugin which is uh a newish google thing

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,800
okay just track some metrics about uh

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,559
the performance of your

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,960
of your site um so yeah it was supposed

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,720
to be

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,240
it was supposed to be a smallish release

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,920
but we've been working on for last few

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,640
months it took a little longer than we

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,280
thought it

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,359
when we thought fast refresh um ended up

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,880
being you know pretty large feature

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,359
um you know some of this new uh the new

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,319
jsx transform that came along sort of

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,520
just a couple weeks ago ended up being

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,960
you know a little bit more tricky than

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,119
we thought

00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,480
so it's it's been in the works for for a

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,119
while so it's yeah it's nice to get it

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,599
out there

00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,319
hopefully people like the new features

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,800
very cool

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,000
and um yeah we even talk about templates

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,520
too as well um

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,800
and sort of creating templates but is

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,720
there somewhere in the docs that we can

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,200
you can briefly talk about that

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,800
and focus on um they're probably the

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,559
best i think there there probably are

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,520
docs on it um probably the best way

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,440
though is if you just

00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:21,280
go to the code um

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:24,480
for the the project itself okay yeah

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,160
um so we've we used to ship uh we

00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,520
shipped two of our own templates a

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,319
javascript template and a typescript

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,760
template um so it's just in the packages

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,240
directory

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,960
um so we've we've converted those as

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,000
well

00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,480
to be um like so if you click on cra

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,480
template

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,319
yeah so so if you're looking to create a

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,960
custom template this would be a great

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:50,000
starting point

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,480
i also have a repo of minimal

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,520
templates for cra people sometimes

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,280
request like

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,559
you know they don't want that the

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,920
spinning react logo

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,079
and the whatever they would just want

00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,440
like a blank white page

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,559
um so i also have uh a repo of some of

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,480
those templates

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,839
um so that could also be a good place to

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,280
start but i would i would recommend if

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,839
you do want to build a template

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,720
um yeah just just start from one of

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,800
those

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,640
um it's pretty straightforward it's

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,599
basically what you see when you create a

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,119
new project

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,200
yeah just in its own project yep

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,880
and then yeah you publish that to npm

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,720
and then you can create

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,319
uh you can bootstrap your project with

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
your own custom template if you want to

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,400
you know

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,240
put your company's logo in there instead

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,640
or something like that yeah i mean if

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,240
you're

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,920
working at an agency and you wanted to

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,359
create react app

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,280
based on the agency template it sounds

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,400
like you can do that yeah it's useful

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,800
for that or

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,440
some other projects will use it for

um a local company

00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,040
