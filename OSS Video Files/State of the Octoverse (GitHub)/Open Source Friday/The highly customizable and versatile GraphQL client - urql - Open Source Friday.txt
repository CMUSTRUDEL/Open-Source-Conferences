Publication date: 2021-04-28
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	urql is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks. It's built to be highly customizable and versatile so you can take it from getting started with your first GraphQL project all the way to building complex apps and experimenting with GraphQL clients.

While GraphQL is an elegant protocol and schema language, client libraries today typically come with large API footprints. We aim to create something more lightweight instead.
