	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
backstory i studied cs in college

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,960
that was my first time programming but

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
by the time that i reached

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
my senior year i kind of decided like oh

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,320
i don't

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,000
i don't want to be a developer because

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,000
being a developer is just

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,279
like being a code monkey in a room by

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
yourself uh

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
and i also think i didn't really have

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,960
any

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,800
good role models when i was in college

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,359
uh like people

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,840
in tech who looked like me who were

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
doing work that i wanted to do

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,640
but so one of the things that i did do

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,920
in college that i really liked was being

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,840
a ta for the like intro

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,640
intro level uh programming cs class

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,280
and so i really loved like helping

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,079
people

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
go from not understanding a thing and

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,640
feeling really overwhelmed to being like

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,480
okay i kind of know what's going on and

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,559
i'm like more confident in my

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,280
abilities to make a thing yeah and so

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
after after college i went into

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,600
education instead

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,840
so i did an americorps program called

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,840
city year for a year

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,119
where i worked in a third grade

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
classroom

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
with students there doing like in

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
classroom support

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,000
uh and i like taught my third graders

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
how to code on our lunch breaks which

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
was really fun

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
uh i would just like bring a couple of

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
them upstairs and we would

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
do the like code.org curriculum on my

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
ipad

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
oh wow and yeah it was a lot of fun and

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
that like seeing how excited they got

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,560
about it

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
made it feel me i don't know it just

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
made programming seem more fun

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
uh whereas you know in college it's like

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,520
i'm doing this for the grade and

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,759
so that i can graduate um and so after

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
after that year was over then i i went

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,360
and worked at code.org as an intern on

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,399
their educate

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,040
excuse me on their education team uh so

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
i was

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,640
like helping write curriculum instead uh

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,159
and then

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
from there i went to work at girls who

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,360
code uh who was a non-profit

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
focused on like getting middle school

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,239
and high school girls interested in

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,760
computer science

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,040
uh and one of the things that we did

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,800
there uh was we wrote all of these

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
like women in tech spotlights to

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
basically highlight the work that a

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,120
woman is doing uh

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
in in the tech industry and just like

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,520
how they're using programming

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
to make an impact in their communities

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,200
uh

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
and so like while i was writing those i

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
kind of realized like oh there are ways

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,599
to

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,440
to like help the world for lack of a

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,760
less cheesy phrase

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
by by being a programmer and so after

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,239
that

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,519
i got a job like an entry-level

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
software developer consultant job uh at

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,680
a consultancy called

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
thoughtworks um i've heard of them was

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,239
this

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
yeah where is the space in new york or

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
which uh

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
office they so i at thoughtworks i was

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,440
based out of their

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
san francisco office their headquarters

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
is in chicago but they kind of have a

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
bunch of different

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
uh areas like hubs yeah uh

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,280
yeah international as well because they

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
met up to you yeah yeah a few folks in

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
uh brazil

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
uh downward side yeah pipeline brazil

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
nice

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
that's awesome uh yeah they're really

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,879
great and i love them

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,760
uh and so i i liked being a developer i

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,680
feel like i really

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
leveled up my technical skills while i

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
was working there

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
but something that i was really missing

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
was the education piece and kind of

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
having that be

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
a formal part of my job description yeah

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
um

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,200
and so i saw a couple months ago

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,200
uh posting on twitter for the for the

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,239
gatsby documentation team

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
um and so applied applied to that uh

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
because it's

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,799
it felt like a much better blend of the

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,640
the technical stuff that i had learned

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
and also the education piece that i felt

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,879
like i had been missing

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,040
and so i got here excellent are you

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,360
originally from the bay area

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,959
i am okay so where'd you study east bay

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,280
i studied cs because i was really into

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
theater when i was in high school

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,040
and i did a lot of like yeah i did a lot

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,600
of technical theater

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,360
yeah uh so i i really liked lighting

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
design when i was like a junior in high

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,919
school which is when you're starting to

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,160
look at colleges

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,520
uh and for some reason in my head i

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
thought like okay

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
i'm good at math and science but i don't

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,320
want to be a doctor so that's how i got

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
to engineering

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,880
and then like computer electrical

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
engineers is maybe like

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
lighting which is not at all uh

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,120
and so i just kind of picked it because

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,600
i don't know i was 18 and didn't know

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,680
what i was doing excellent yeah um

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,280
do you know we're in the bay area do you

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
know chloe condon who's a

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
devrel at um at microsoft she originally

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,240
came from theater

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,840
and uh learn how to go through um

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,720
hackbright actually what's the local

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,400
that bootcamp

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,280
or not but a bootcamp um

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
but yeah that's yeah fascinating i'm

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,479
always interested with people's

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,680
transition stories of getting into

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,280
tech because yeah you have a cs

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
background uh but you ended up

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,440
eventually getting there through

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,759
education

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,960
um yeah which is uh yeah it's intriguing

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,240
it's like something to think about too

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,280
as well for folks who are just now

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,759
getting started

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,000
is that there's no like golden path for

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
getting into engineering or programming

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
and getting a tech job it's it's just

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
about interest and

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
sort of like continuing down that path

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
which it sounds like that's what you're

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
doing with code.org and teaching kids

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
and

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
uh which is amazing totally and i

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,440
definitely think

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
like as somebody who was sort of a

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,240
career

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,039
change um like bringing in

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
a lot of skills from teaching or from

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,759
like whatever background you came from

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
before

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
kind of gives you a leg up in a way

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
because

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
there are like people who don't have

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,880
great communication skills or they're

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
like oh we need to communicate this idea

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
so that other people can understand it

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,000
how do we do that and so that's

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,160
something that like i have a lot of

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
practice doing that maybe somebody else

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,080
who's just coming straight from a

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,520
program like a

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,440
degree program doesn't know so

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
use use whatever skills you have yeah

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,800
exactly uh and speaking of skills those

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
skills have gotten you here to

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,479
working at gatsby now uh full time uh

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,360
who aren't familiar

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,919
yeah so gatsby like fundamentally is a

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
framework that helps you build react

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,000
sites

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
uh so one of the nice things that it

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
does is it kind of

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,199
bakes in a bunch of uh

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
like things that would be hard to do if

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,160
you were just a single

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
developer building your own site or

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,880
building a site for like

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,479
an agency um so like we try and think

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,280
about things like performance

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,240
and accessibility and security and kind

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,520
of bake that into the framework so that

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
you don't have to spend as much time

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
thinking about it and you can just focus

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
on like

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
how do i build the react components and

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,720
the pages and

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,240
like where do i pull in data from um

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,160
so that's that's kind of the gist of it

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
okay cool yeah and i'm a fan of gatsby

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
i've been using gatsby often on for the

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
past couple years i guess

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
since i've been around and uh yeah i

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
like the

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,840
the idea of like static generation which

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,599
gatsby sort of

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
came out the gate pretty strong back

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
when react was still sort of figuring

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,440
itself out

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
so being able to have that context but

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
also

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
in my modern web development javascript

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,400
framework world

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,759
um which is react that's what i spent a

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
lot of my time in so

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,800
yeah i'm familiar with it hopefully uh

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,160
anybody in the chat if you've used

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
gatsby let us know let us know what

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,959
projects you're

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
you're working on that use gatsby or

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,880
what projects you would like to work on

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
uh and then we can see if uh it's a good

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,680
fit might be an example actually

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
for you too as well which i want to talk

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,800
about your role

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
at gatsby uh and what you're sort of

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,519
focused on day-to-day

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
yeah so i i am on well i'm a

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,640
documentation engineer

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,240
and the company's kind of in a

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,760
transition period right now where we're

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,360
moving from

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,800
having like a documentation team uh

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,040
to having more of this like

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,120
cross-disciplinary

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,200
squad model where now it's like

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,120
the squads are kind of the new teams

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,920
where you've got like a designer and

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
developers

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
and like a product manager and a

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,760
documentation engineer

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,800
um so rather than

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,560
rather than like just being the sole

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
person writing the documentation the

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
goal is to kind of move towards a place

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
where

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
engineers can write their own

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
documentation and i can sort of be a

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,600
consultant

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
and like help give guidance on how might

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
you best

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,080
organize the information and like

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,480
explain a

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,200
really technical concept in a way that

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,920
like newcomers can understand

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,480
yeah and that at i like that model and

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,560
um

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
it's something that we do at github so i

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,040
don't do full-time engineering at github

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
i do devrel

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
so i do a lot of interactions with the

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
community as well as with the

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
engineering teams

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
but what they do is when they ship

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
features primarily i've seen this with

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
the api is we have a change log

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,800
and everybody has to ship a change log

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,079
and that helps the documentation

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,079
uh actually documentation has to get

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,200
shipped alongside the feature and the

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,800
feature is new

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
um which i like i like seeing that

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
stings get blocked if there are no docks

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,760
because there's nothing worse than

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,720
trying to do something and you don't

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
know how to do it because no one's

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,519
explained it

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
right exactly it's like if you've

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
delivered a feature but nobody knows how

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
to use it

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,040
did you really deliver the future it's

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,040
like if the if a tree falls

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,720
falls and nobody hears it yeah did you

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
really ship it to production

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,000
yeah and there's a question in uh arn

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,320
for

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
vvv um i don't know if you know this i

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
know the answer but uh

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
i'll pitch it to you uh what are

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
advantages advantage to the gatsby

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,920
besides server side rendering

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,360
um i mean i think i think it's

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
the stuff that i kind of alluded to

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,880
before where there are performance

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
benefits where like your site ideally if

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,399
everything has gone right

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
your site should be really fast uh

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
because

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,040
at build time it sort of goes through

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,120
and does

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,959
um without getting too in the weeds it

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,959
like does all of the

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,760
building of like the specific pages and

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,200
pulling in data

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,680
yeah and so that happens when you

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,120
compile it so that when you run the site

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,640
all of that all that data is already in

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
in the page and so uh it loads really

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
quickly

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
um yeah and i've got the uh like

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
literally from the website

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
some bullet points as well there we go

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
so having the incremental builds

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,920
uh so if you do build like your about

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
page the about page gets it built uh

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,600
gets built

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,920
as opposed to the entire site um i think

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
the

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
some of the built-in image handling um

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
has been nice

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,079
uh and it's something that people kind

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,720
of point to um as sort of the model for

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
progressive loading images i've seen

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
kyle kyle

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
being the ceo and i guess original

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,480
creator of gatsby

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,320
i've seen them talk at different

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
conferences and meet up here about that

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
one feature

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,160
and handstand that's been something that

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,760
i've been super excited about since the

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,519
beginning and seeing other people

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
sort of lead with that as an example of

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
how you handle images so

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
definitely check out the examples and

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,880
check out the blog posts and

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,399
talks around gatsby like there's a very

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
large community around it so

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
uh arn you there's definitely plenty of

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,079
information out there we can share links

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
later

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,200
uh and we can also walk through that in

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,320
a moment too and then

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,079
um praiag s uh

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
apologies from the pronunciation of the

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,600
twitch handle but uh can you talk more

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
about the documentation engineering role

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
which you're our first documentation

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
engineer

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,160
person in that field that's been on open

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
source friday and

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,440
i think it might be something that most

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
people don't think of as like a

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
like a role you could do as an engineer

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,560
so do you want to um

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
speak just a little bit more and like

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,839
what that entails and like

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
what sort of companies are looking for

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,839
that role um

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,160
i know less about what kind of companies

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
are looking for that role sort of like

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
anecdotally without any

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
direct links i think that there is kind

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
of a movement right now where a lot of

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
companies

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,360
are kind of starting up either a devrel

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
team or sort of like i've seen

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
developer educator or something like

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,880
that some kind of title where it's like

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,760
your focus is on

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,959
teaching people uh which still requires

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
like the technical background because

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
you have to know what you're talking

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,760
about

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,920
yeah but but like trying to

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,839
focus on communicating what's happening

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
internally either externally or

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,880
sometimes even to like other

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,360
people in the company like something

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,959
something that i'm thinking about now

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,880
and full disclosure i'm also new to

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
gatsby i've only been there

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,160
this is week three or week four or

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
something like that um

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,920
so a lot of a lot of things are still

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,760
kind of being decided on

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,399
in terms of what i'm gonna do um

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,480
but something something that i'm

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,040
thinking about is like there's a lot of

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
sort of pockets of knowledge internally

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
that

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
even our internal engineers sometimes

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
are like oh i only know about this

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
thing because i heard it in a slack

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,120
channel or like somebody

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,120
i had to ask for help to figure that out

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
so my goal is to how to try and figure

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,920
out how to make that

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,160
easier just like making sure that

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
the right information is documented so

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,000
people

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
can find it uh and then also like once

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
they found it

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,959
is it actually useful like does it help

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,639
them solve whatever problem

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,480
that they're trying to solve yeah and i

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,079
would say too as well um

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
like being able to explain things and

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,959
being having that being that

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,519
introduction to how people can

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,160
explore a feature is it's huge because

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,440
i've

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
used a lot of products i've used a lot

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,720
of open source libraries that

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,160
i had to figure out on my own and i

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,440
think the when you have that assumption

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
of like people will figure this out

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,560
that's when you know

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
you you're failing um right but if it's

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,279
something that's intuitive and like

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
people discover things

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,279
naturally and can discover how to sort

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,040
of advance to the next level

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,480
um that's where you want to be so like

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,560
being able to really slow down

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
and make sure people can use the thing

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,079
uh super helpful

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
um and i just want to mention too as

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,880
well this is

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,720
this conversation is about gatsby so

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,040
folks are looking for comparisons like

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
we

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,440
are going to do comparisons uh but if

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,160
you do want to learn about next.js we do

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
have an entire

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
interview we did with nexjs it's go to

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,199
youtube.com github

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
where you can learn about next and their

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
benefits and how you can contribute this

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,199
project

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,199
uh but i do want to know how to i guess

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,560
how if i wanted to jump in the gatsby

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,920
maybe i've used it a couple times or

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
maybe i just want to try it out for the

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
first time

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
uh i guess what is the sort of like

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,639
central location for folks to

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,600
basically try it out yeah so there's

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,880
kind of like two

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,519
tiers of getting started with gatsby

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,320
there's like

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,639
how do i get started with gatsby on my

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,279
own project like i want to use gatsby

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
as a vehicle to build something else uh

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,839
and then the second

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
part i guess maybe more advanced is like

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,720
if

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,199
you want to contribute to gatsby itself

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,920
like as a tool or the documentation

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,199
uh so if you're totally new to gatsby

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,240
and want to get started

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,279
uh this is the docs page uh we do have

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,040
a tutorial that's kind of a step-by-step

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,759
um guide through how to set things up

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
and

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,079
tells you a little bit of information

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,519
about like just what even is gatsby

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,320
how do we do styling how do we do data

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,440
like where does the data come from

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,680
and so that's that's a good entry point

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,959
if you're looking for

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,480
like a total introduction and then if

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,279
you want to

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,399
contribute there's kind of two ways that

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,600
you can contribute you can

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,440
contribute to like the gatsby framework

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,560
itself like the code

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,240
or you can contribute to that

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,000
docs site um yeah and so this

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,120
this is the github repo for both of them

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,160
um if you look at

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,360
this used by numbers wow massive

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
yeah yeah excellent yeah this is the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
repo

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,120
that we're sort of just perusing through

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,439
uh i think a lot of people

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,880
they first sort of jump into a repo to

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,039
for contribution and to see what's

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
happening i like to use it as a gauge to

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,280
see if like it's the thing of being used

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,319
so like

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,079
already i can see there's a quarter

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,439
million people using it and projects at

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,760
least that are open sourced

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,640
i think is how that number works um and

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
then

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
as far as like issues poor requests you

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,919
can sort of get a gauge of like how

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,559
things are sort of operating you can see

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,760
one hour ago we liko which i know liko

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,360
um

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,559
uh definitely seen a round he um

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,320
had to commit they actually got merged

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,600
in an hour ago which is pretty cool so

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,799
you can see there's some

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,720
pretty good activity um happening but i

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,720
think if we if we focus more on the

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,400
contribute to gatsby for the rest of the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
conversation i think we could uh

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
i think it'll be a lot of sort of

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
nuggets we can sort of discover together

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,760
um but i see the contributing india is

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,200
usually the first place i look at

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,880
and then i find out it takes me directly

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
to here to how to contribute so i

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,520
actually have this open in the tab

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
thanks for folks who are looking to get

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,679
their first contribution during

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,080
hacktoberfest

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
or first contribution just in general

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
it's definitely a great place to start

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,919
for sure

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,120
um so do you uh i guess week three

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,520
um but i'm curious to understand like

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
how gatsby sort of handles participation

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,280
in the repo

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,880
is there like open source managers

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,799
maintainers or is it similar to your

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,160
model of documentation where

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,640
it's up to the engineering team yeah so

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,679
it's

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
it's it's definitely an open source

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
project so

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
we we have in the issues we have like

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
community members

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,640
reporting things that are wrong um

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
making suggestions

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
um and so all of the issues that are

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,840
opened get

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,679
automatically tagged with i forget the

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
exact label but it's like there's a bot

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,160
that

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
adds a tag that's like triage needed or

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,120
something like that

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,320
um yeah so

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
and then and then there's like a

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,640
rotation within

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,799
our engineering team uh to

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
to like go through everything that needs

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,679
triage and basically decide

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,160
like which team within gatsby

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
is responsible for this so for docs a

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,640
lot of times they'll add

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,559
these like status uh there's one that

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,160
like yeah status needs docs review

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,960
yeah so that's on me uh and

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,000
so then i'll go and like look at it and

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
give comments

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
and kind of move it from the point it's

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
at now to

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
when it's done yeah it looks like you've

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
been tagged too as well so yeah that

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
this one

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
this one was kind of this one was like a

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,679
pr

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,360
that was opened before an issue and so

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960
uh part of our process is like oh we

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,640
need to have the issue so that we can

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,559
kind of like have the discussion

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,320
beforehand yeah and that's actually um

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
not to move too fast over that but

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
something that i think is missing a lot

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,760
of times when people go to do

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,720
uh contributions in oktoberfest or just

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
in general

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,240
um you could spend a lot of time working

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
on something that you think belongs

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
in the code base or belongs to the

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,799
documentation but if you didn't have the

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,559
conversation before

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,080
then you're going to have a very like if

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,720
it doesn't belong then it's going to be

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,840
a very

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,080
bad experience for you and the

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,120
maintainer um

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,799
yeah so open up issues

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
it definitely doesn't feel good like as

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,679
a maintainer either to be like oh you

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,200
worked so hard on this

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,240
but we can't use it so yeah open

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,919
open issues what um

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,440
uh sean actually had a question about

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,360
how do you know how do you figure out

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,120
going back to documentation real quick

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
how do you know what to document

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,840
and whether documentation is hitting the

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,280
mark like is there a way to

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,200
[Music]

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,240
target and get metrics um

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
well metrics is kind of a secondary

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
piece

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,640
it's like the follow-up like you have to

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
do that after you've figured out what to

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,000
write

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,000
for me like the thing that i try and

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,080
keep in mind

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
so like from from curriculum writing

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,520
there's this framework called

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,679
understanding by design

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,679
uh and it's a it's a really widely used

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,039
framework not in the like technical

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,720
sense but of just like way of thinking

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,400
about things yeah i'm just looking for

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,240
this a good blog post on this or

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,360
something yeah there

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,600
there's yeah it's it's a whole book and

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,400
there's a bunch of a bunch of different

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
people have

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
have written about it but the basic idea

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,799
is like you start with

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,520
your end goal first like you always

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,640
start with

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,000
what do you want learners or like users

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
in this case to be able

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,360
to do and to be able um

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,280
there's a real focus on transferable

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,840
skills so like what do you need to

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
understand

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,039
in this context but also what do you

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
need to know

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,559
to like be able to go off and do things

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,039
on your own

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,960
um and so that's kind of that's always

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
my starting point is thinking about like

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
what is

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,720
what is the goal what are we trying to

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
help users

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,440
achieve and then from there you can kind

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,280
of break that down into like okay i want

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,000
them to understand

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
uh like how data works in gatsby and

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
then you

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,280
can like break it down from there and go

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
into like what are the

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,960
like the next stage's assessment like

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,200
what what are the things

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,720
that i need to be able to see a user do

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
to prove that they have this

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,919
understanding

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,679
and then from there you can kind of

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,000
figure out like okay what's the best way

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,360
to

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,320
teach students each of those

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,919
things um so for for me it's always

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
about like starting with the big picture

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,080
and then kind of breaking it down and

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,080
getting more granular from there

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,840
and i think i think that sometimes the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,000
tendency

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,360
is for people to be like oh i understand

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,679
this concept and i want to just like

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,799
jump

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
right into teaching that thing but i

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,000
think

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
and this is this is maybe a kind of a

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,760
problem with the

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,080
way that our docs have grown so far is

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,440
like then there's less of a

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,039
cohesive path through things

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
it's like you've got a really good dock

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,600
on you know bringing in

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,360
data from wordpress or whatever but like

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,039
how does that fit into the whole

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,080
and into this like learner's journey

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,799
through your repository oh yeah i uh

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,240
i am very much thinking about that right

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,760
now for myself because i teach a lot

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
about github actions and i'm doing

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,000
uh youtube videos primarily as the

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,919
medium to do that mainly because

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
i'm just exploring the medium right now

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,840
and

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,480
i i'm thinking about how each video

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,799
connects to

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,679
the last one uh because yeah i think

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,280
with like this

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,880
understanding like how youtube i don't

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,720
understand youtube's algorithm by

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
any means but understanding how there is

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
an algorithm that you want people to

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
click through to the next one

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,919
so you make sure the subject matter of

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,559
the project is consistent so that way if

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,480
you can

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,000
easily reference and say i'm not going

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
to talk about docker this video because

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
i spent the whole video on docker

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,880
so please go back to that video and then

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,880
you can still

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,360
progress forward but if you happen to

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,080
land on video 5 or

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,440
the dot page three you can always refer

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,279
to page one and two

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,799
and it's something that totally i guess

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,240
if you have as you're explaining if you

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
have the big picture

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,520
um you can then have the sort of outline

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
and steps eventually

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,120
as long as you know what the goal is

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,000
which is right teaching gatsby

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,240
in this this manner yeah and i think i

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,400
think like with documentation

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
especially it it's important to think

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,919
about the sort of like mental model that

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
users are constructing

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
as they're going through your

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,559
documentation and like

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,919
don't don't get too in the weeds before

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,760
they kind of have a big picture

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,520
understanding um because

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,120
yeah there's like no sense in in going

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,400
into super deep

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,679
detail if they like are just it's just

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,039
not gonna go over their heads anyway

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,080
yeah and that's the um

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,240
i don't know how long you've been doing

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,120
react programming at all uh

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,679
actually how long have you been doing

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,520
react uh a couple years

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,600
okay yeah so i've been doing it since

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,840
the beginning uh which is not a slex

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,640
i'm just saying but one thing that kind

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,440
of got me

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,120
like i guess got me annoyed of react

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,960
because i didn't do react right right

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
away is it every time i went to like a

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,559
blog post or documentation

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,159
people wanted to teach me the virtual

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,200
dom and all i want to do is make a

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,120
website

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,039
and when you spend the entire time

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,159
beginning of every single

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,840
blog post conference talk tutorial

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,679
like let's talk about the virtual dom

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,679
and it's like the um that one meme

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,600
of the guy who talks about aliens on the

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,240
history channel documentary

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,799
and it's like aliens like that's how i

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
feel about

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,640
every time someone talks about jsx or

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,080
talk about the virtual dom

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,840
uh when at the end of the day all i want

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,760
to do is make a website like i'm not

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,240
really interested in like the nuance

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,120
and if i if i am like let's all as

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,279
collectively as

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,200
documentation people and teachers and

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,120
educators point to the one central

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,760
source which hopefully is the reaction

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,279
docs and not try to re-explain the same

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
thing that everybody's out there

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
exactly it's like give them give them

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,600
what they need when they need it

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,960
and then i think that there's there's

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,200
definitely a lot of power in like

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,000
linking away to other resources

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
so that if you choose like if that's a

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
thing that interests you then go down

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,200
that path but otherwise

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,799
yeah and focus that is something that

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,440
too

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,720
i talked to michael jackson and ryan

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,360
florence about this

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
and they do training on specifically

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,679
react training

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,039
and they spend way more time talking

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
about react and they learn how to do

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
that

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,799
even though we have this like virtual

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,440
dom the router like

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,000
how graphql or redox or whatever all

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,679
that works

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
like they do a very good job of actually

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,240
avoiding

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
like talking about all the stuff you

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
don't need to talk about and focusing

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
just

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
on this thing uh which is react or at

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
this point like we're talking about

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,480
gatsby so just

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,799
focus on the feature and gatsby that we

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,240
need to share and get get across

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
and be able to have those sort of like

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,880
web like

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,520
the internet of gatsby knowledge um sort

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
of linking

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,640
all to all the way to this like one

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
central thing that we sort of landed on

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,440
so

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,720
um sorry my excitement and the way

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,919
you're explaining this is like yes this

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
makes so much sense

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,720
this is what i'm doing nice excellent so

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,400
i think we took a little tangent on like

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,799
talking about like higher level like how

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
documentation how do you sort of like

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,159
talk about how to teach a person a thing

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,520
but i think coming back to this p this

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,520
uh issue and

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,600
how the labels are reviewed i did notice

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,960
that um gasbot i think it was the bot

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,480
you were

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,600
yeah chatting uh mentioning

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
yeah so that happens uh yeah i don't

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,000
actually know

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,159
how it works but i know that when you

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,360
open a new issue it'll add that

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,279
triage needed uh label to it

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,039
and then one of our engineers will go

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,159
through and decide like okay

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,840
who internally needs to look at this

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,520
um and then from there we'll sort of

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,640
have a discussion about like okay what's

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,080
the action plan

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,760
for this issue uh if if you

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,440
are a contributor and decide to open an

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,919
issue

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,480
make sure to have like reproducible

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,399
steps

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,480
if you find a bug or something like that

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,799
um because that really helps us

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,640
figure out like is this really a problem

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,240
is this just a problem with like your

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,120
local setup or like with gatsby as a

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,960
whole

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
uh and so that's that's definitely

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,240
something to make sure that you include

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,919
um and then

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,919
at least something that i try to do is

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,120
like clearly outline

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,320
um what the steps are to resolve this

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,360
issue kind of like

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,960
acceptance criteria uh or really just

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
like a checklist of like these are all

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
the things you have to have

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,440
before we can close this issue so that

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,039
then

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,120
the sort of next piece is either you or

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,399
some other person who sees the issue can

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
decide oh

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,440
this is a problem that i know how to

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,520
solve

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,039
i want to work on it um and so

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,279
then at that point you would kind of

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,919
comment on this issue saying like

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,840
can i work on this and then one of the

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,320
internal engineers would say like yes

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,039
you can

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
and then assign it to you uh and then

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,960
you

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,120
go off and write code and or docs

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,080
uh yeah and yeah it sounds like a

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,159
magical place

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,159
and uh makes me want to go to grab an

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,799
issue um but i'm looking at this

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,840
and what we i think this might i'm not

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,440
sure if this is a

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,600
gatsby employer actually i could

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,960
actually find out um

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,960
doesn't look like a gatsby employee but

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,399
this person opened up a pr

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,080
um and but there's no issue attached

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,840
ah yeah uh is it a docs one

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,039
uh i believe so documentation.js example

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,200
caption string yeah we don't have to dig

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,120
in specifically this one but i was just

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
i was going to comment on the fact that

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,279
oh did we just we just got a new one

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,200
triage needed

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,440
two minutes ago wow but i was going to

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,600
comment on how little

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,000
issues are here that need triage so it

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,200
seems like someone's working right now

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,960
yeah there there's uh i think

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,399
yeah i think i saw in stand-ups somebody

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
was gonna work on triaging things oh

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,840
excellent

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,600
um but yeah so then then sort of the

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,960
next step is to go and look

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,120
for because because once things get

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
triaged sometimes it's like oh

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,640
this is a problem that we need to handle

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
internally and so we'll have

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
our developers work on it but sometimes

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
it's a thing

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,559
where like oh this is something that

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,399
needs to be fixed and is maybe a good

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,679
like entry point for somebody who's new

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,919
to the repo

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,080
um and so in that case there's a

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,279
different label that will apply

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,960
um right now because it's october fast

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,080
it's the octoberfest label

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,919
yeah creative uh and

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,399
i guess when it's not hacktoberfest

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,279
there's a help wanted

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,880
label yeah um so that's that's another

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,640
one to look at

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,480
next month um but so if if you want to

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,880
contribute to the repo that's a good

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,399
place to start it's like look for those

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,159
two labels separately together um

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,159
oh there's also one that's good first

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,200
issue which if you're totally new

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,120
is a good place to start yeah which i

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,320
think i saw at least one

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,799
there yeah right now we kind of have

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,240
the good first issue alongside a bunch

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,960
of the hacktoberfest ones

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,840
yeah um yeah so it's a good a good

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,559
starting place

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,760
yeah have you had a i guess hector

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,679
passport or wink

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,200
two at this point have you had a lot of

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,919
people sort of jumping in and asking

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,960
questions about

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,159
issues in hacktoberfest um

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,600
yeah actually for so part of my

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,679
job when i first started was like

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
identifying oh these issues would be

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,600
good

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
for hacktoberfest and like getting them

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,440
ready so putting in those

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
like lists of steps that need to be done

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,440
for each issue

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,720
uh but then it was like you know two or

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
three days before

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,039
october started and i would like add the

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,720
label and then almost immediately

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,200
somebody would pick it up and i was like

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,039
ah

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,480
i'm glad that you're so enthusiastic

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,320
about contributing but you're like wait

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,960
two days uh

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,679
so so yeah a bunch a bunch of the issues

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,840
have

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,200
uh have been picked up yeah it looks

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,000
like there's quite a few people who are

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,360
asking about this one and liko is uh

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
going back um yeah what is this one

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,000
uh this one is simple gatsby canonical

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,559
urls protocol bug

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,840
ooh interesting so i don't even know

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,840
sure what rao

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,320
canonical is um i don't know

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
oh yeah it looks like um looks like it's

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,200
doing something they found an issue and

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
uh

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,279
they have reproducible steps too which

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,360
is um valuable to have

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,399
um and this is something that i've

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,480
actually started doing

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,399
um for my good first issues because i

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,120
find good first issues are not meant for

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,320
like

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,600
i'm just going to throw a bunch of easy

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,240
stuff that i don't want to do it's more

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
of like

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,240
i want to throw a bunch of easy things

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,399
that people can have breadcrumbs into

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,360
contributing to the project and then

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,120
join the community

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,399
like join the discord join the slack or

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,559
whatever it is

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,480
and feel like you're a part of it um so

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,519
like actually having a solution

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,279
um for how to fix it or i kind of like a

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,799
rough idea of how i would do it myself

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,440
is something i've been starting to do

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,720
pretty regularly on my issues yeah and i

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
think that that's

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,760
great because it's it's like scaffolding

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,440
their experience

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,799
pretty much uh because like there's such

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,480
a huge learning curve

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,919
if this is your first time contributing

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
to open source in general

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,000
just like the whole how do i fork a

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,000
thing and then how do i

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,200
open a pull request and what is a pull

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
request like that

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
that's like enough to focus on for your

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,640
first thing without also needing to dive

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,480
into the complexities of this

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,159
code base that you're looking at for the

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,799
first time yeah and i would say anybody

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,799
who is a

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,919
at that point that megan just described

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,200
we do have an intro

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,640
to github courses on lab.hito.com uh so

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,399
definitely check this out

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
um i should probably i should have had a

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,000
link ready for that but

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,519
um they're all self-paced learning it's

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
actually built on the same technology

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,720
that your uh your gas bot is built on

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,480
so neat so integrates with the with the

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,360
github's api directly and so you

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,840
integrate

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,480
you learn through github prs and github

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,720
repos

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,799
so it's a unique way to learn some of

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,040
this stuff but yeah

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,560
now back from our uh commercial break

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,079
and continue

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,079
on this always be uh always be selling

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,000
it's good it's connecting people with

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,440
with new learning resources

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
excellent there's a lot of thank yous

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,839
actually in the chat and i appreciate

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,359
everybody who's following the channel if

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,879
you want to learn more about

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,679
open source and how to contribute and

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,760
talk to project maintainers like megan

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,960
uh from gatsby uh just hit the follow

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
and you get notifications every time you

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,599
go live

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,679
on this channel to talk about open

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,919
source

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
so the yeah so it looks like based on

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,200
the the hacktoberfest label you've got a

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,159
lot of uh back and forth on folks who

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,879
are interested

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,320
in working on this um none of these

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,679
folks look like they're all any of them

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
look like gatsby employees looks like a

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,399
bunch of people oh yeah

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,159
that one's peter's one of ours oh is he

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,280
okay yeah i guess i'm thrown off because

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,920
like with github we have a

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,400
giant staff label so sometimes i just

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,680
associate that with companies but uh

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
not everybody gets that privilege i

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,920
guess um

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
but yeah very cool so peter was in there

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,359
and providing

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,560
uh even as of two hours one hour ago

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,920
looks like we're

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,079
we have some active communication which

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,119
sometimes could be a concern for folks

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,200
who want to contribute with

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,359
hacktoberfest and

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,960
sometimes like myself i have to wait

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,480
like a day before i can respond because

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,320
i've got a couple other things to do my

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,160
project kind of small

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
but with gatsby there's people who are

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,240
ready and willing and

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,440
it's a good way to get involved oh this

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,880
looks interesting gasps we have

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
superfest 2020

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,000

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
yeah this is sort of our like umbrella

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,280
hacktober ring yeah okay

very cool follow the instructions yeah

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,839
it looks like there's some customer

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,079

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,280
tickets coming in too as well uh but

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,800
yeah very cool i like that

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,320
uh gatsby actually took a time to um

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,400
kind of announce their intentions at

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,280
hacktoberfest i think this year we've

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,680
uh we've focused uh and i say we uh the

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,720
hacktoberfest team has pivoted into

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,320
the opt-in model for hacktoberfest so

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,520
uh projects that are opted in which i

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
know gatsby is i've seen them in the

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
list

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,400
um can help people get their

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,200
hacktoberfest t-shirt or tree

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,920
planted um consider planting a tree this

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,240
year

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,520
and but in addition to that you get some

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,640
pretty cool stickers which

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,119
i did not know about nice

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
yeah very cool love stickers you can

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,560
never have too many stickers

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,320
yeah no if i had my sticker cam on i'd

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,440
share it but i didn't have it set up

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,599
i'm still this is my third week using um

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,880
this setup so i don't have my all my

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,240
other cameras set up to

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,839
properly share my office but i'm dead

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,119
everybody watch older videos to see my

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,560
uh my sticker

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,640
i have a i have a camera that actually

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,520
sits behind my laptop

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,880
so i can switch to it's like before we

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,079
grab water before we started i usually

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,480
switch to the um

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,520
the sticker cam and uh nice yeah it's a

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,520
nice little easter egg

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,240
but looks like yeah so i guess at this

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,520
point we sort of got the introduction to

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,520
you and gatsby

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,839
um talk about help wanted did you want

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
to look at an issue you had in mind or

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,079
do you

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,760
just want to pick one blind and we can

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,960
sort of walk um

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,000
that would have been a good idea i

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,480
should have picked one um let's see

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
i'm trying to think of which ones don't

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,440
already have

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,400
people on them yeah we could also do

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,520
this little

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,520
assigned to nobody flag

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,280
and there's one other thing uh also a

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,800
brief commercial break

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,400
uh i've been doing a youtube series

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
called get action traction

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
and i built this action uh which i

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,320
gatsby doesn't have to use this but i'm

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,440
just sharing it for folks who have

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,680
similar issues

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,000
of assigning signing issues to people i

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,079
built that action to

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,359
so people can take action and assign

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,599
themselves to issues

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,599
and i do this out of necessity for

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,599
myself because i don't have a team

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,040
and like my project we have like a

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,240
handful of contributors

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,000
uh but it's an action where you just

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,640
write dot take in the comments of the

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,400
issue

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,720
and then that person who said take it

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,359
assigns them to through the action spot

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,160
um so folks who are interested in

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,079
something like this

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,839
all the code is open source and freely

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,320
licensed so

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,920
feel free to take it and do your will

00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,320
and whatever you would like to do

00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,200
or embed it into gas bot um too as well

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,720
which is yeah

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,640
yeah i wrote this in bash mainly because

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,800
i was learning bash while writing this

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,599
um but you can see i just have a simple

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,680
curl command

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,040
that assigns whoever commented to that

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:17,440
issue and that's how it works

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,480
that's cool but moving back to gatsby

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,880
um yeah i mean we don't have to i'm

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,800
actually

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,920
curious about more inclusive language in

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,000
docs

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,000
oh yeah that's that's one that has been

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,640
open for a little while um

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and this this i guess is a good sort of

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,520
more general

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,160
tip on uh like writing documentation

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,280
um you don't want to make assumptions

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,359
about

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,800
what people know and like what is going

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,680
to be hard for

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,480
what's going to be hard and what's going

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,640
to be easy for different people yeah um

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,160
so sometimes something yeah sometimes

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,119
come up in a lot of documentation

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,760
circles of using words like simply right

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,160
and i think

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
i think that the intention is to try and

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,720
make it seem less

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,839
scary um of like you just have to do

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,560
this and like

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,160
it'll be easy to do whatever yeah but

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,200
then to be the person who gets

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,160
stuck on that step it then like not only

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,079
do you have a problem

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,839
now you've got some kind of bug

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,359
something's not working but also you're

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,480
doubting yourself of like oh god this

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,960
was supposed to be easy

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,800
and i'm having a hard time with it like

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
maybe i just shouldn't do it and then

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,000
that sends you into like a whole

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,079
imposter syndrome spiral

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
and if you just didn't say simply you

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,480
could avoid all of that

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,880
yeah it looks like they're they're even

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,400
linking to a conference talk i believe

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,160
ooh nice talk yeah it looks like the

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,880
conference talks about don't save simply

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,560
which yeah so i actually when i worked

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
at my previous employer i used to so

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,760
github has a full docs team we actually

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,839
opened source docs last week

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,960
um cool yeah so that's exciting and

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,240
we're actually we're gonna have the team

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,800
we don't talk about now but we held the

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,480
team on

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,480
next week to talk about open sourcing

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,920
docs uh which is a nice little

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
intro um talking to gatsby about docs um

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
but i worked with documentation

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,560
engineers in the past

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,000
and this is coming up in like even my

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,400
writing where i am

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,079
yeah always even if it's a blog post or

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,800
i'm just talking from stage at a

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,680
conference

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,319
like i'm always on alert to make sure

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,480
i'm not

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,480
making assumptions because i've also

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,640
been stuck on simple things

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,839
that are quote-unquote simple and you

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,280
just don't know

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,520
like some people don't even start

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,440
programming with git so like if you

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,359
simply tell people to write git commit

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
or whatever right that could

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,720
be like wait hold on slow down i don't

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,839
know what git is

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,520
and yeah then you're like oh you don't

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,000
know get us how you don't know get so

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,760
that's like

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,119
right back to my explanation about the

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,319
react training folks

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,280
who kind of avoid all the other stuff

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,720
to just talk about react like by not

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,760
saying simply and not doing all that

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,760
stuff you can just focus

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,920
on the teaching the thing you want to

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,040
talk about and if the things are quote

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,560
unquote simple

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,839
um you don't have to say they're simple

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
you can just link to them and have

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
people

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,760
go back and check out the cliff notes

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,400
and other things but yeah go ahead i'm

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,640
sorry to

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,920
go into myself no no i i think that

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
that's a really good point that you make

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,119
about like

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,800
trying to limit the distractions of like

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,160
you're trying to teach them

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,560
this topic just focus on that topic and

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,839
like

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,200
anything like get things or i don't know

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,240
just anything that you don't

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,280
actually need to do that one objective

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,240
just don't don't do it like teach them

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,319
that somewhere else

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,240
and then you can link them to it but

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,160
just focus

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,760
like limit your scope you can only teach

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,079
them so many things at once

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
yeah yeah and i'm curious though like uh

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,560
i'm sorry to go understand more

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,520
documentation because i feel like since

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,280
having you

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,560
and i think uh listen like all the

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,920
viewers are sort of enjoying the

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,680
conversation as well

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,520
like what is your what's your approach

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,520
to getting better at documentation like

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,119
are there like if i know if i want to

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,119
learn javascript i write tests

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,119
or i go build a small little project but

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,000
what's like a way someone if they want

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,720
to get better

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,359
and be more aware are there like tools

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,560
of the trade that you recommend

00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,079
um i mean the like

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,839
cheap answer is you just have to keep

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,680
doing it yeah uh like

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,119
i something that i something that i

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,920
try to do uh is i have a like til

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,560
today i learned repo where i just have a

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,000
bunch of folders and it's like not meant

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,160
for other people's consumption

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,520
necessarily it's just a way for me to

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,800
track like these are the things that i'm

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,440
learning about

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,280
um i guess kind of like a digital garden

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,400
where everything's in various levels of

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,440
done

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,400
um but that's a good way to practice

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,839
distilling like just the basic

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
information that you need to know and

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,000
then

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,359
you can like link out to other things

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,960
like this is the article that i was

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,400
reading when i had this thought

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,119
um and then also like looking at other

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,200
people's

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,359
documentation like i really like looking

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,200
at dev.2

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,480
or to i don't actually know how they say

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,440
it i think

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,400
officially they're dev uh but everybody

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,079
has the uh

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,880
the dot too yeah yeah but there's a

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,200
bunch of

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,960
there's a bunch of different ways that

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,480
people explain things on here

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,200
um and some some of the articles are

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,280
better than

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,119
others but i think that it's a good just

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,920
like having this sort of

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,280
bucket of things to choose from you can

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
look through the way that

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
different people's different people have

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,560
explained the same topics

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,800
and see like oh i really like the way

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,839
that they tied in this analogy

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,040
and i really like this diagram and

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,000
like just trying to build your own style

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,160
based off of the way that other people

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,200
have done it

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,079
i guess analogies is also a good a good

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,440
tip just general like helping people

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,319
understand a thing like if you can

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,160
relate it back

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:49,280
to like a similar concept

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,319
that they already know um like maggie

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,000
appleton ableton has a really great talk

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,319
um about react metaphors like visual

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,800
metaphors to help you understand react

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,359
um and she's got like one that's like

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,839
react

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,160
as a potato plant which is like not a

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,560
comparison that you would normally

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,000
make but then i think it really helps

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,240
people who are new to it

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,040
understand yeah this is the one uh

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,560
understand

00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,800
like how how does this thing

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,640
like basically what mental model can i

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,119
build for this idea

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,640
yeah that is super abstract like how do

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
you make that more concrete and

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,280
relatable

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,520
nice i should talk about the dom too as

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,079
well yeah i would like to hear your

00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,880
explanation of the virtual dom yeah it's

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,680
it's very cool

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,400
yeah awesome yeah i would definitely uh

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,760
checking that out

00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,520
i just like the video because i know it

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,920
goes into a magical place

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,839
on youtube into a like playlist so i'll

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,200
watch that in a bit too as well after

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,720
we're done talking

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,480
um but yeah thanks for going to that

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,200
little tangent for me um yeah

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,319
i love it yeah there's a hearing from

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,359
the experts in

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,359
how they approach things

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,920
yeah it looks like uh i'm not sure how

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,520
apt it is for this one has 118 comments

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,680
oh wow uh typescript migration yeah

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,760
yes everybody wants typescript does

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,200
gatsby run on script right now

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,119
i don't know i think we're in the

00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,960
process of migrating yeah

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,319
well i mean there's 64 people who are

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,400
interested at least in the

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,599
conversation oh wow i like to roll in

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,560
the bottom and

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,760
see so it looks like people actually

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,599
migrating stuff

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,040
oh that's good yeah so everybody sort of

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,640
ups for grabs which

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,880
sounds like a great yeah it looks like

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,599
we have an open emerge pr

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,800
wow so it looks like things are things

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,599
are happening in that world

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,319
as of yesterday uh nice which is pretty

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,240
cool

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,520
yeah honestly like just going through

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,720
issues and like understanding the

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,240
history of the project

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,839
is a good way if you don't know where to

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,040
start and jump in

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,400
seeing if you can understand the

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,119
conversations that are happening right

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,480
now like

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,400
what i'm just doing right now while

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,440
you're here and keeping me honest

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,119
um you can see that there are there's

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,880
some type definitions that have been

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,319
imported i don't write typescript or i

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,400
just sort of consume it i don't even

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,319
have to um so i don't actually

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,319
understand all the ins and outs of it

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,079
uh but it looks like there's yeah type

00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,800
composer so it looks like they're adding

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,440
typescript um to files which is pretty

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,760
cool

00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
which i had a joke about um adding

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,040
typescript to my project during

00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,880
hacktoberfest and if it would happen

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,319
uh and seems like it seems like it

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,119
happens i guess so

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,720
yeah which is that's the beauty of open

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,640
source you don't have to know

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,160
typescript to get typescript into your

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,079
project no

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,359
this is this is amazing because yeah i

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,359
was joking because i didn't think that

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,280
would ever happen but it seems like

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,720
this is not only labeled hacktoberfest

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,640
but it is literally

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,880
a typescript migration yeah um amazing

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,839
and yeah thanks blaine for kicking off

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,119
this conversation

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,880
and i think it actually starts with that

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,200
too as well like

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
it's it's probably i don't know i guess

00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,000
i can check and see if blaine's a gaspi

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,640
employee as well

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,119
um he used to be he used to be recently

00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,960
but

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,480
he was okay yeah so at least he oh he

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,920
even like

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,760
shouted out and said that gaston is

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,480
actually looking to make this migration

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,040
happen

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,079
so yeah so basically shouting it out and

00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
saying this is the thing that we're

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,160
looking for

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,119
is a great way to get contribution um

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,079
like eyeballs on things um but it seems

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,440
like yeah

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,119
very popular uh issue yeah

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,720
if we gave away points for people who

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,000
open issues um

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,079
we wouldn't do that for obvious reasons

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,520
and spam but

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,960
uh blade would have a lot of points

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,760
because a lot of people have jumped on

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,400
there and

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,520
um uploaded it with their uh what their

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,440
responses

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,960
yeah so uh we have like roughly 10

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,720
minutes left did you have anything else

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,599
we wanted to um

00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,160
showcase um um i guess we can talk

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,119
through

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,520
we can talk through at a high level like

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,720
how

00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,520
if you want to get started this all

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,040
sounds great uh how would you

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,440
do that like how would you set it up

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,640
locally um

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
so i guess the first thing that you

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,160
would do is

00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,839
go through and like assign yourself to

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,200
the issue or we would assign you

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,040
we'd even talk about that the docs

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,319
themselves live inside the monorepo is

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,559
that correct

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,319
yeah yeah so there's this whole docs

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,640
thing and actually like

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,760
it's kind of confusing like our site now

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,400
uh when we

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,160
when we merge the dot org and the dot

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,280
com site there's now like a separate

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,720
repo that's actually uh

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,559
building our dot com site

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:29,040
um but you can still use this repo to

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,119
uh to like run it locally and you'll see

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,240
the docs in like the old version

00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,760
of the docs site um but at least

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,520
it'll let you like check your mark down

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,079
and stuff yeah

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,000
okay it sounds confusing but it sounds

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,280
like there was a migration between

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,599
two different places where the docks

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,160
were uh so if you are confused when you

00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,319
run it

00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,319
i'm sure you can probably ask a question

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,160
yeah yeah definitely there's also

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,440
i guess this is a good chance to plug

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,800
there there's like an ask

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,839
gatsby js twitter um

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,599
that you can at them and then

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,280
for now you can use the hacktoberfest

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,079
hashtag um

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,040
and that i think that our customer

00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,720
success team

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,880
looks at this and they can either help

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
you solve the issue or they can

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,000
direct your question to the right person

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,200
internally

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,480
um and then

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,359
oh here's the uh the note about

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,359
typescript hey there you go

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,720
is that the pinned one uh this is oh it

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,559
looks like a plug-in

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,599
to i guess consume it yeah

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,680
yeah so maybe it's not actually

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,520
converting typescript

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,599
but new and gatsby typescript support

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,240
but folks interested in typescript

00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,240
definitely look at the pin tweet and

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,720
check that out

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,440
but sean's saying the ask gatsby is a a

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,359
great idea

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,440
which it is um i think github has one

00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,680
too as well we call it github help

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,880
um so it's easy if someone sort of like

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,480
shouts in the ether

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,480
which is twitter and says hey why is

00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,880
github doing this thing what i do

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,520
i usually just at mention github help

00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,079
and then they'll

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,440
nice they'll respond uh that way

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,280
especially

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,440
especially someone's like brian on

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,640
twitter uh this thing on github's not

00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,880
working or you moved it

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
and i'm like i don't know it was a big

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,359
project

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,280
this guy mentioned github help and then

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,599
like slowly back away

00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,040
yeah which is always helpful yeah

00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,640
especially as somebody

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,119
who's new to a company it's helpful to

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,640
be like go

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,119
these other fine folks will help you out

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,079
because i can't oh yeah that's a

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,359
a good mention there and um forgot how

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,119
we got here oh we were talking about the

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,319
docs and where they live

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:37,440
oh yeah so so you'll clone

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:40,680
this whole repo and then you can see

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:44,400
there's like all of these

00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,760
individual uh markdown files so all of

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,720
our all of our documentation is written

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,680
in markdown

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,440
um and then if you were gonna like where

00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,400
is it it's

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,400
yeah so then this thing you could see uh

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,520
i think if you went to like our actual

00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,800
docs

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:05,680
site so like gatsby.com docs

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,359
slash whatever that title was

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
like adding analytics or something like

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,960
that yeah

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,559
um i think you might even be able to

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,079
just type it into the url

00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,520
just like add it afterwards leverage the

00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,200
uh the beautiful search here there you

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,440
go search

00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,640
hooray yeah so this is what it looks

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,000
like on the live site

00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,839
and then if you were to go back and look

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,119
at that markdown you could

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,440
just like check for yourself that it

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,559
works that it's the same text

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:37,520
yeah so when you

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:40,160
clone the repo uh you'll have to do

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,960
you'll have to like cd change directory

00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,599
into the www

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,319
folder uh and that's the actual like

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,079
directory

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,280
where the the site is or like the old

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,640
version of the site

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,760
is um and then you'll have to

00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,880
start you'll do like npm install

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,960
in there and then you'll uh

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,720
what is the start command i think it's

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,800
just like gatsby developed

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,319
gatsby develop yeah or is that the yeah

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,720
that's what i use if i had a gatsby site

00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,119
i'm not sure if that's the same as uh

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,640
yeah well because the www folder just

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,960
like is a gatsby site

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,040
yeah yeah that makes sense yeah yeah

00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,160
meta using gastry to build gatsby which

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,440
is also exactly it

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,359
i started that tangent about the

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,599
contributing md and the contribute

00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,359
being a link to the gatsby site and the

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,319
fact that gatsby builds sites and that's

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,160
the tool itself

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,000
it makes sense that the content itself

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,040
is inside of a gatsby site

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,480
so that way it's a way to dog food

00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,839
exactly exactly um

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,520
yeah and so then from inside of that

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,200
directory that's the place that you

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,800
would like start

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,480
or start uh gatsby develop um

00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,400
and then you'll like go to localhost and

00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,160
be able to see your stuff

00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,640
so at least for adding for adding new

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,200
documentation you'll like make a new

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,000
directory or make a new markdown file in

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,280
that

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,640
docs directory and then there's also

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,800
a sidebar file that like

00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,160
you can add a link to yeah to make it

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,040
show up in there

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,520
um and all of this is written in we have

00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,680
a

00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,640
in the contributing docs yeah there's

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,000
like a

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:24,559
doc that's specific to uh

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,079
contributing documentation yeah exactly

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,359
i'm intrigued sidebar yeah and it's

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,839
basically right now it's

00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,640
it's just like this giant list of all of

00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,040
the

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,280
all the docs and what order they go in

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,280
um

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,200
something to like tease a future change

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,000
i guess

00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,400
uh something that i'm hoping to work on

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,799
is

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,480
sort of like reorganizing the

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,799
documentation that we already have

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,319
uh because there's a lot of it and like

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,920
as the community has found

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,599
new features that they've wanted to add

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,160
and we've kind of like kept building

00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,559
this thing

00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,319
up right now it's a little bit unwieldy

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,400
and hard to

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,160
find what you're looking for especially

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,799
if you're new and don't know

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:10,799
where to look um so hopefully

00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,920
hopefully that'll that'll get easier in

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,160
the future

00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,520
cool all tbd yeah and i while you were

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,559
talking i was trying to get running on

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,000
the code space which

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,400
now is running but i think i'm not sure

00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,400
if we have

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,839
yeah you'll actually go to instead of

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,359
the docs

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:33,839
directory you'll go to slash www

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,880
oh gotcha yeah and then like the docs is

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,760
the folder that

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,040
the content lives in yeah i think i'm

00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,480
gonna have to do a lot more

00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,359
npm installing and stuff like that

00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,319
because none of this is yeah there's

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,680
a lot of packages yeah so yeah we'll

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,440
leave that as is

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,880
and um uh what i'll do is uh you did

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,319
i don't know are you i don't know if

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,400
that was you that dropped a link in the

00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:00,480
chat i didn't even grab your

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,119
twitch handle uh to oh yeah that's me

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,920
okay so i just re i we have to make you

00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,680
a vip

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,400
uh to allow you to post links um

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,520
here very important person here um so i

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,359
failed to actually ask you

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,640
