handles below our faces so that if

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,799
anybody wants to follow us

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,160
um you've got you do some streaming

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,440
actually let's just do a proper intro

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
i'm curious to hear

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,880
you know why you're here what's your

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,599
background how you got the coding

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
sure uh so i'll give you the the

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,880
elevator pitch uh my

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
name is brandon roberts you can follow

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,760
me on twitter at brandon t

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,119
roberts i work at

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,480
narwhal which is a consulting company

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,800
where we uh teach

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,239
large companies how to build like large

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
applications at scale

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,320
uh also a maintainer on the njrx project

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,160
where we

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
um it's a a set of reactive

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,239
reactive libraries for angular that's

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,480
built on top of are primarily on top of

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
rxjs

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
and like you said if you follow me on if

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,120
you follow me on twitter i tweet a lot

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
of gifs and

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
i have a lot of fun there also so just

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,120
be

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,559
forewarned that the gifts will be flying

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,320
all right well we appreciate the warning

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
too as well that's uh

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,520
uh some people don't know what to expect

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
from from twitter and what they're gonna

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,320
get when they they follow individuals

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
um but i actually was just gonna ask um

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,119
what what do you mean by like what is

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,799
reactive programming

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
um because maybe some people on the on

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
the call like they do javascript but

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,119
they don't know

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,640
exactly what that means yeah so reactive

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,520
programming to me is kind of is a like a

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
shift in the normal program that we're

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,479
used to where

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,119
you have you're uh calling commands or

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,280
you're performing these actions and then

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,000
you can't you kind of constantly have to

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,159
pull or

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
check to see if certain data is ready or

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
if something has happened

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
or if some event has been triggered that

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,600
you need to

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
perform some task against reactive

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119
programming

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,600
is a flip of that so it used more of a

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
push

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,360
based approach to where

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
you listen for changes and when those

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,759
changes happen you automatically get

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
them

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,599
as a as a subscriber to those events and

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
rxjs provide what we use on rxjs

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,040
provides

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,879
apis to um allow you to

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,239
use those reactive patterns and build on

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
top of those in a

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,760
standardized api as opposed to like say

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,760
you having a

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,800
poll whether something has been updated

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
or

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
in the case of angular applications you

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,280
rely on their

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
change detection system to let you to

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,599
link

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
your link like your components to their

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,959
templates to know when things are

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
updated so uh

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,000
to me it's more of a push-based approach

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,319
as a

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
as opposed to a pool-based approach a

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
lot of people are used to

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,360
so i'm that's interesting so is it like

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
websockets like so i understand like

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
subscription websockets

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,840
like is there a difference between that

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
or are we talking about the same

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,120
technology

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,319
uh there is it's similar

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
because you could use a websocket arcgis

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,120
promotes

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
uh using the observer pattern and using

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
observable so

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,319
a websocket could be something that you

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,040
observe for

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,360
changes or you wrap a websocket inside

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,680
of

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
an observable so that you can so that

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
other people can consume that

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,200
uh those messages that are coming out of

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
a websocket or

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,440
even pub sub would be another example of

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,239
something that's more

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
push based and you could actually wrap

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,519
an observable

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,640
around some clubs of service

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
and use it as your primary api to

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,159
for your consumers to listen to changes

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
as opposed to everybody

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
having a you know subscribe to the club

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,159
sub or website

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
directly so they're similar in that way

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,080
but

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
um the rxjs and observables is more of a

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,879
standalone

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,519
thing because you can use like say you

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,879
can use websockets with rxjs you can

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,120
have use pub sub you can turn uh

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,519
promises you can wrap promises and

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
observables and turn them into streams

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
even though they only you know give you

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,319
that value once so

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,760
yeah okay interesting um

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,519
yeah and i'm sure we'll get into way

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
more detail about that in a moment too

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
as well

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,199
i'm curious in the chat though if

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,799
everybody's here i know we got some

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
people representing the south we'll also

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,360
have um another person

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,840
from huntsville as well uh in the chat

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,320
um

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
yeah see ya they say a war eagle see see

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
this is where the

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
this is where the the issue's coming in

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,360
see i'm i live in alabama but

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
okay i lived here long enough to say i'm

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,800
from alabama but i'm a tennessee

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
transplant so i'm i'm go vols i'm

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
you can say war eagle and that's okay

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
you could say a road tie but

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
um tennessee volunteers over here so

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,600
yeah yeah and i think uh

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
some people might be confused because i

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,120
know we have some uk people representing

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,600
in the chat too as well who are silent

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
uh we're talking about football but um

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
oh yes but we're actually talking about

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,960
american football

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,639
so this this sort of banter that's

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
happening right now it's very similar to

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
like football

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,280
uh over there in europe as well so uh

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
yeah sports it's like pick your favorite

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,360
two teams

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,639
that uh are close to each other and and

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
you got the same thing

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,520
you have people on one side or one or no

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
deeply invested in one side or the other

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
yeah i i'm from florida so we had the

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,800
gators and the knolls

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
so i was a i was a knowles fan growing

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,919
up

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
uh but my brother was a gator fan uh

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,720
this die hard getter fan and i'm just

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
like wow oh wow

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
that sounds rough yeah especially like

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,039
you're in the same house and you

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,880
like two total not totally different

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
teams but yeah there's a

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,560
built-in rivalry there but yeah he

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,520
actually is a transplant into he lives

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
in tennessee as well

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,199
uh just south of nashville so uh he

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,960
actually goes to

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,479
uh falls games to uh go see the gators

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,759
okay so yeah yeah i remember i remember

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,440
yeah tennessee and florida had many uh

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,440
at least as far as college football is

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
concerned and many many battles was back

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
in the day

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,560
yes when i watched the sec

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
so yep it's legit so yeah we get

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,720
we talk about football but uh what's

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,319
what's transitioned to your your

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
your roland tech so you mentioned

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
narwhal uh being an agency i didn't

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
realize they were ages there i've seen

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
the

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,960
i definitely have like a little one of

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,479
those plushies actually i think we

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,160
probably i was in ng-conf

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,520
a couple years ago we probably at the

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
same time there

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
i spoke there uh i did like a lunchtime

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,039
workshop

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
um and then i stood at the booth but we

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
probably crossed paths if you've been in

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,199
our wall for a bit um yeah well i've

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
i've been at i've been at narwhal for

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
the past

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
year but i've been around the angular

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
okay gotcha face and ng-conf and

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,440
everything yeah for

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,199
longer than that but yeah i probably

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
yep sorry you had uh angie come because

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,880
i've been at the last

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,759
four four of them four or five

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,240
something like that i lost track yeah

00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
well

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,039
yeah i do remember github being there

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,560
yeah we have um people well i guess uh

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,720
uh putin is uh though he's from

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
he's from uh huntsville and then silicon

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,360
darks in atlanta so

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
if you're interested definitely check

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
out the conference um i'm not sure if

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,680
there's a remote version of this this

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
year but

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
zach does a really good job at

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
conferences so i'm sure whatever he does

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
it will be pretty good um so highly

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,599
recommend

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,280
but i'm curious can we just zoom back

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
i'm trying to i would love to learn like

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
how you

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
uh got in the tech how you got into

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
engineering um

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
and then like how you ended up getting

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,960
in the ngrx project too as well so

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,639
start from whatever point you feel like

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,319
you want to start from

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,400
so way back in high school now but yeah

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,280
i got into uh tech and programming

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,680
in high school um and i'm just gonna

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,160
admit it like i'm an old man so

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
i when i was in high school qbasic was

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,039
the the

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,240
programming language of choice that we

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
had in our uh

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,479
science class or in our what's kind of

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
what you call them extracurricular

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,400
classes yeah so uh we used qbasic and i

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
really

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,800
enjoyed doing that i think the first the

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,160
app that i can remember

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,560
building was a basketball

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,639
it was like a basketball game so it was

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,000
completely written in q basic the

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,650
it was basically like a stick man who uh

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
who i had a stick man and a

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,400
[Music]

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
goal that went up and down and it waited

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
until you

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,879
uh pressed the button on the keyboard to

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,399
try to shoot the ball

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
and if you're you know if the arc was

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,440
correct then you timed it right then it

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,800
would of course go in the basket so

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,640
that was pretty much my first uh program

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
first i guess legitimate program that

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
ever wrote

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
and uh so that was high school and then

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
that was

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
and then i spent a lot of time with

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,600
computers growing up just in general so

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,839
building computers i've been around them

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
a lot but programming really stuck with

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,320
me

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,920
as i went through high school and then

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,880
college also and when i was

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,519
after i left high school went to college

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
and then

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
didn't do much there the first time

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,720
around came back

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
came back to work and but i was still

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
like doing

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,360
projects on the side like little side

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
projects and everything so

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
one project i had like a while back

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,839
programming it was

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
just another html this was back when

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,880
this was back when tables were hot

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,600
html css and a little bit of javascript

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
but it was a it was like an audio site

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
where you could go and listen to like

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
streaming audio tracks

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
um so it's just a little homegrown site

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
there

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,080
but along that way i had worked i had

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,680
done side projects and i was kind of

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,360
working through school

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,720
and i ended up getting going through

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,320
like community college

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,160
and going through uh

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,959
getting my bachelor's degree and then i

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,320
got my first professional job as a php

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
developer

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
so i was working actually out at

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,279
marshall space flight center that we

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
talked about earlier

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,760
building web apps for like their support

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,000
systems

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,160
so it was like php html css

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
and just a sprinkling of javascript uh

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
in there

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,040
for that so i worked there for a little

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
while and

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,360
uh moved there to other jobs where i was

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,640
i had to get my uh put my feet to the

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
fire with jquery

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
and build some maps with that uh built

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
some interactive

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,800
uh interactive interactive apps with

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,079
html css and jquery

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,040
and then uh kind of moved on to

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,079
other projects that were like across a

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,720
many different

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,320
spans of technologies like say jquery

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,519
was one that i worked on i did

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,160
c-sharp back-end projects and

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
uh one project that i think is still

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,800
active today is

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,320
uh sencha js uh i think they still never

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,839
heard of that one

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,040
yeah they said yeah it was a framework

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,880
that was and i think it it lived

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
it was around the same time angularjs

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,800
was around but i was using that at the

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,640
time to build the application that i was

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,000
working on

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,760
so i used that for a little while and

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,200
eventually i got another job that i was

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
working at the

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
army game studio which i know people

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,079
they're probably

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,680
many people don't know what the army

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,839
army game studio is but

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,959
is that that that one game that came out

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
in the early 2000s

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,640
um yeah america's it's got america's

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
army oh yeah i played that oh okay yeah

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
i played i definitely played that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,480
because i was a counter-strike player

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,000
um back in high school and even like

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
in the middle school and then when that

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
came out it was like oh free army game

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,160
like i'm down with this because i did

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,760
rainbow six i did rogue spear and then

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
that came out and i was like

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,000
this is this is it like this is awesome

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,880
so you worked on that then

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
well i worked we worked on the the

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,000
website of

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,440
the army yeah army game studio because

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,959
there's like there's

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
the army has the milk uh

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,519
developers that work on the game

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
themselves and then we worked on the

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,440
website of that so we

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
built the website that's still out there

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,920
today as america's army.com

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,200
the game still works too as well yeah i

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
believe so oh well

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
so i honestly have not thought about

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,600
that and that's been like

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,120
what 15 years no that's too long like 10

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
10 12 years

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,880
it's been at least 10 i think 10 12

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,160
years uh but yeah the

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,079
we built the site to like expose the

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,680
stats to the players of the you know

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,079
players of the game so you can see what

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
level you're on what ranked you're on

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,680
and uh we built some other things some

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,040
other web properties that

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,320
basically promoted stem and things

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,440
that were tailored towards

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
um taylor story stem activities but

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
i also had the angle of if you were

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
interested in getting into the military

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
it kind of

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
suddenly hinted you and hey you know if

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
you like

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,720
uh football american football and uh

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,399
you like stem maybe you would like like

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
the army too so

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,760
yeah i mean for the word context and

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
maybe you maybe i i

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,200
this is the context i had because um it

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,040
was a game

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,880
like just like like now everybody plays

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880
fortnite uh it was a little more

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,000
realistic than fortnight so like more

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,639
like call of duty

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,440
before call of duty was the thing but

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,920
basically

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,120
first person shooter you start off like

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,160
even the training was like you start off

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
in boot camp it was like one of the

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,959
first

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,120
games i remember actually doing like a

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,360
proper boot camp and a game

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
and then it's just an online shooter

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
where you just do like

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,079
army drills or you go take out

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,720
terrorists

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,519
um but yeah it was quite a piece of like

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,399
i don't know if it'd be

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,079
you call it propaganda or whatever but

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,160
the goal was to sell you on the army

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,399
and then like recruit you uh and like

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
make that make that an interesting thing

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,760
um this is like yeah pretty intriguing

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
like approach

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
i didn't know it was like still a thing

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,720
but yeah hats off to army like still

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,279
going strong then

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,560
yeah so we we called ourselves like the

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,399
marketing arm

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
the marketing arm of the army because we

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,440
don't want to uh

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,360
say like oh we help you know kids

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
uh build bombs or anything like that we

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
weren't doing any of that stuff we were

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,160
trying to promote

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,079
stem education so that's what we so i

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,279
always i was i used to mentor at a boot

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,279
camp and i used to joke

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,560
uh with the bootcamp students because

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,760
they would be like oh i don't know it's

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,079
just gonna work and it's like we'll just

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
hit

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
run and see if it works like we're not

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,040
shooting rockets

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,560
and like literally in your case you work

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
for the marshall space center

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
and you work for the art the marketing

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
arm so like in that case like yeah yeah

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,120
you kind of are shooting rockets yeah

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,279
yeah make sure you test that order

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,040
yeah um so that that application was

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,079
php back in angularjs on the front end

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,880
and that was how i transitioned as

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,440
for working there a few of my friends

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,360
that i'm

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,720
a few friends that i met there that i

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,079
still keep in touch with today i'll

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
mention them mike

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,480
ryan he's the one who helped me get

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,839
evolved angularjs

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,839
um luke luke howe who i'll be talking to

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
like later today actually

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,279
and um other people brad sam i'll

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
mention them

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,560
we built we helped build that uh website

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
which was like said php on the back end

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
angularjs on the front end

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
and this was around about the time that

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,360
angularjs was being

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,920
not sunsetted but angular it was

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
transitioning from angularjs to angular

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,959
so i got

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,680
involved in the angular ecosystem like

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,399
pretty early

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,240
2.0 yeah it was called yeah it was

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,120
called angular 2 at the time

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,199
yeah yeah and uh i got in like during

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
the alpha stages of that so we started

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,759
building

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,079
the other good thing about working there

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,480
was we got to experiment a lot so

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,680
we were you know definitely there in the

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
angular 2

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,440
alpha days and we're building actual

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,040
apps with it

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
and trying to see what we could do with

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,440
it so that was how i got

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
involved in the angular ecosystem itself

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,320
and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,639
how i got involved in like the open

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,920
source side of it was of course anglers

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
open source so i wanted to get involved

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,199
with

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
like the angular router because in

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,839
angularjs

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,120
like nobody pretty much nobody used the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440
one that was built in

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,399
yeah so i wanted to like contribute to

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
making the one

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,480
in angular 2.0 a lot better

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,440
so i basically jumped in github

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,320
issues and uh tried to help people where

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,560
i could

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,680
pull down sample repos and try to build

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,160
things with it

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,360
and kind of learned it that way and so

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
if we fast forward that

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
i had gotten involved with the angular

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
router and then we had built something

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,800
like that built some things with

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
america's army internally

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,839
and one of them was basically an angular

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
version of

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,320
redux

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
that we had built there but we couldn't

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
open source

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
it because those things just weren't in

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,439
place at the time to do

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,160
uh so then ngrx uh comes along

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,280
and the founder of indirect his name is

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,439
rob wormwald he

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,039
used to work uh for google on the

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
angular team

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,640
so he started the project basically as a

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,959
weekend project

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,720
for it called it uh ngrx store was

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,640
basically an angular version of

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,240
uh redux that was you know popular in

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,360
the react community

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,200
uh so he started the project uh

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,799
indirect store and then of course we

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,039
were looking at that

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,320
um we were looking at that project

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,400
saying okay

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,080
that's something we can use because it's

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
open we can contribute to because it's

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,480
open source

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
as opposed to our version which is

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
internal and

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,240
you know we'll probably die when we

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
leave because that's just how things go

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,880
so

00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,000
we started contributing to interx store

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
and you know rob we talked

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
to rob and he was like hey do you know

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
you know i want to contribute more to

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,960
the project

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,280
you're like sure so we ended up saying

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
we

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,919
me and mike at the time were like the

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,600
primary people working on the project

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,480
um as far as like working on issues

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,240
and uh interacting with people who are

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
trying to use injured store

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,640
and uh use it apply to their projects

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
uh of course because redux is like a

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,720
state management

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,039
yeah library for uh projects and

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
indirect store is the counterpart to

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,640
that for angular projects

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,400
yeah so you were doing all this on your

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,520
your free time or was this part of your

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,880
your day job oh this is all free time

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,679
like i've been

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,480
i think it's been what's i've been

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,840
working on the

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,880
project for going on five years probably

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,039
total

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,120
as far as like getting involved with the

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,880
project up until now

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,919
uh it's all been free time and we have

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,919
had some uh people that you know sponsor

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:09,120
us as far as the indirect org itself

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,600
um that we do some things there but or

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
get

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
some stuff there but that goes towards

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,840
like hosting

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,360
and uh if people have travel expenses or

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,760
or you know contributors to the project

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,559
have trap core contributor that

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,120
expenses that they use that for but uh

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,799
but

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,880
as far as like development and

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,600
everything all that has been in in free

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
time

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,840
and like nights and weekends of course

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
you mentioned before your dad like i'm a

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,480
dad too

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,559
uh so trying to balance that uh

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
i've been doing better these days but

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,000
back then i was

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,919
less balanced about how much time i

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
spent on you have you have young kids

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
are they

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,160
older they're they're relatively young

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,280
they're uh

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,559
eight five and two okay wow three all

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,799
right that's a handful

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,240
so yeah when i started when i started

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,840
working on the project

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,000
i only had one so

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,080
so i had more time when i first started

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,720
out up and of course up until now

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,159
and a lot a lot less time when you got

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,280
three instead of one so

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,640
yeah i so i got two which is a one six

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,240
and the other one's two am i thinking

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,520
because they're they both have birthdays

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,159
in two months um but uh

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
same like you like i time is a very

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,320
precious commodity when you have

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,880
children

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
uh so i tend to i'm curious of how you

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
approach getting open source

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,240
contributions and work done and

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,880
maintaining because i tend to just do it

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
during work hours so like you get to the

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
point where you just do your like

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
when i was engineering full-time because

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
right now i'm a developer advocate so i

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
ended here part-time

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
but when i was engineering full-time i

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
got to the point where i just shipped

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
features

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
and then you ship the same feature the

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
same way but somewhere else on the app

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
uh say become an expert so i would get

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,200
my job done in like two or three hours

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,159
you know in the day and then like reddit

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,760
hacker news

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,320
twitter like i filled the time up

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,840
somewhere else and so instead

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,600
i started transitioning like hey i'm

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,640
gonna work on something that to

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,000
advance my skill set on the job and i

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
tried to get the balance of like okay

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,280
i'm gonna offload

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
my free time open source contributions

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
into my work time

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,480
and it's gonna justify it i just chatted

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,679
with iffy just um yeah 30 minutes ago

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
chatting about this and

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
how we sort of like due to balance i'm

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
curious how you did a balancing act

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,880
today

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,799
of getting contributions yeah so

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,360
today today is actually

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,840
uh out of out of the ordinary i would

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,039
say

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,559
because of course being juneteenth our

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
company as i mentioned before normal

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
actually changed it so that today would

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
be

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
a holiday for the people that work in

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,559
the u.s

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,240
so normally i would be

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,559
normally how i work on ngrx or if i'm

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,600
doing

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,919
open source work these days is uh

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,720
i have to get up pretty early anyway so

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,480
once we

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,919
once i get up and you know get everybody

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,679
out of the house then

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,760
i have a little bit of buffer time to

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,840
where i'll check on the project you know

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
check on issues see if anybody's open

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,880
prs you know since i

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,440
checked yesterday and um

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
check on that so i get a little bit of

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,880
time in in the morning and then

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,640
maybe throughout the day i'll just kind

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
of glance at the project see

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
because of course i can't turn my

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,080
notifications off

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
because well i guess i could but then

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,880
they would i don't want them to pile up

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,760
uh so i still get emails uh from

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
you know github when people file issues

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,400
and things so i may not

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,080
respond to them immediately um which is

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,000
like i said something i'm better about

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
doing now as opposed to before when i

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,679
would like oh

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,760
i gotta answer this now or they they're

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,520
gonna think the project's dying

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,240
um uh but yeah that so

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,159
it's a little like it's more sprinkled

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,320
throughout the day like if i get a

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,919
take a break during lunch i may check on

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,480
if i have some time i'll check on it

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,720
then

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,159
or if i have some time to work on

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
something really quickly i'll try to

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
just hammer that out

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,400
and then um then of course that's like

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,559
i'm still going through the work day so

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,039
i don't i don't take anything

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,000
significant during the work day as far

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,559
as working on it

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
because it's still a it's still a i

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,320
guess you call it a traditional open

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,600
source project where we don't we don't

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,960
it's all contributors and none of us

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,880
technically get paid to

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,480
work on the project yeah itself so

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
so i go through i still go through my

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,720
normal work day then you get off

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,120
get off the normal work day take care of

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,679
family make sure we get through

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,880
you know dinner and all the normal stuff

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
and then after the

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
end of the day is over then if i'm not

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,600
if my brain isn't fried by then

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,080
then i'll try to write some more code or

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,760
if i can crank out some documentation or

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,880
something like that then

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,080
i'll work on it that way so it's still i

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,600
said it's still

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,240
a balance of and then of course weekends

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,000
you know may fridays i'll maybe stay up

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
a little later to work on it or sometime

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,320
on saturday

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
if i get up if i get a chance but uh but

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,480
yeah it's more

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,440
i i fit it into my schedule more these

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,760
days than

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,880
it kind of dictating what i what i have

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
to do with it

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
yeah i'm uh i'm a big fan of uh

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,400
documentation blog posts

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,039
on the weekends because those are times

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,039
where i wake up early so i'm up

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,120
before my kids get up so i can have like

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,400
my own alone time

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,240
peacefulness uh so it's usually it's me

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,600
first and my son wakes up so that's when

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
i'm sort of reading through stuff

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,679
answering stuff and like sort of

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,440
naturally transitioning into the day

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,799
and then i tend to i tend to write code

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
in the afternoon um

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,080
so usually i'll get i'm done by like

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,640
three o'clock

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,400
in the afternoon um her work so i'll try

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,200
to crank through an hour of like

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
testing or try to like prototype a

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,159
solution

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,919
and sort of like hack at something and

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,799
then when i do have the focus time which

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,080
is like

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,520
sometimes in the middle of the night

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,520
sometimes in the middle of the day it

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,360
just depends on how busy work is

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,640
then i'll focus as i've sort of like

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,240
hacked away at

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,960
solving problems i'll focus and get it

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
done but you mentioned something about

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
email notifications are you exclusively

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,320
using email notifications for

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,120
interactions through github now i

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,880
actually i've started using the the as

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
soon as the github app came out i

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
basically downloaded it like this is

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,720
going to replace my

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,000
this is going to replace my emails that

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,400
i get from

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
people posting issues or pull requests

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,960
and things so

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,640
i use more of the github app now than

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,240
i use email traditionally because i

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,400
would just open the

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,720
email and click the link to go to the

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,960
mobile website but yeah the

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,080
the github app itself has at least for

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,120
me made that

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,400
uh process easier of uh

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,440
responding to people uh yeah that open

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,799
issues

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,720
okay excellent yeah i was gonna ask yeah

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,400
that's a i use the app pretty

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,320
exclusively too as well it's been super

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
nice to just wake up and

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,919
scroll through the apple making coffee

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,799
and see like what needs to actually be

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,600
addressed

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,360
i do like having things sit for a bit

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
and have conversations happen with other

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,640
contributors

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,679
um so in case someone doesn't like we're

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,559
trying to figure out linting right now

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,000
for my project

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,080
um it's just like the next next

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,559
evolution of it and

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,600
i just let the conversation happen and

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,880
then because i happen to be

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
one of the we have two maintainers on

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
the project so i'm like i'm half of the

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
decisions that are made

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,200
or half of that gets to wait to

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
basically say we're doing it

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,159
so i like to have let people sort of

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,240
like plead their case or

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,279
grab an issue and then i will jump in

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
and be like okay well thanks for

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,000
grabbing this issue

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,760
here's a solution or put the solution

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,880
there um

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,720
because i know i don't have bandwidth to

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,200
sort of do everything so i try to like

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,760
prep

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,880
stuff so anybody can walk in and take it

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,080
but um

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,880
yeah go ahead yeah definitely that's

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,000
as i would say that's more of my role

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,799
these days

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
earlier in the project uh we did a lot

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,039
more hands-on

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,679
coding and um like i said

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,159
working on the weekends trying to uh the

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,960
put

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,279
additional projects in the platform or

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,000
fix

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,039
bugs or things like that but these days

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,080
i'm more

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,520
of working to unblock people who are

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,679
trying to contribute because

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,279
we have other contributors other core

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,720
contributors on the team

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,039
besides myself and i'll mention them as

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,399
alex and i mentioned mike earlier and

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,679
tim and wes

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,440
are the main people that you know

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
contribute to it today and then we still

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,360
talk to rob

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,640
also but uh but yeah these days i'm

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,279
handling more

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,960
you know infrastructure things uh if

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,919
people get blocked on

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,840
infrastructure and like contributors uh

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,559
to try to help you know people along

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,679
in that area so like i said most of the

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,960
things that i do now

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,640
are centered around unblocking

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,200
people so that they can contribute and

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,200
like outreach so that if people want to

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,000
contribute to the project

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,080
they can and don't have any major

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,240
hurdles in the way

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,000
wow so yeah this transfer is

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,200
transitioning us to basically showing

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,480
and talking about the project but when

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
you mention contributors like you

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,520
weren't kidding

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,799
um there's a lot of contributors on this

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,200
project

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:22,399
yeah yeah we i i am on the twitter grind

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
uh getting people to contribute uh to

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,120
the project

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,480
but yeah those top at least the top four

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,240
people there are

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,360
core uh court court members of the team

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,279
yeah core team and wes uh another

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,880
one of my counterparts at narwhal he

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,880
works he's on the

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,399
project too and there there's other

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,320
people on the team

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,640
also that uh contribute more in ideas uh

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,880
more than code so yeah that's why i say

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,080
i'm the you know the primary maintainer

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,399
of the project because i'm

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,279
the one who's cutting releases and you

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,760
know having to

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,200
still like nurture the project along to

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,159
but i'm not i don't that doesn't mean

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,720
that i

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,320
i've given up the handle that i don't

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,559
have to build everything

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,760
or trying to build everything myself

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,760
excellent yeah that's uh

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
i dream dream of days where i can i can

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
start dictating and

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,039
handing stuff to people and like

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,440
watching stuff grow without me needing

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,320
to

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,399
touch everything and write every test um

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,320
so that that's that's a dream i have

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,679
um but i'm curious can you talk more

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,279
about that twitter grind like what do

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,559
you mean by are you actually out there

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,039
like saying hey

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,240
i got a contribution do you want to do

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,440
it

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,840
well not as much these days but

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,520
if there are people who like use the

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,960
project i know that i reach out to

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,320
people who use the project

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,080
or uh or people who

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,520
like a lot of people use the project but

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,279
don't contribute

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,799
or they maybe don't have as much um

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,559
guess confidence to contribute to the

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,480
project so

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:57,120
some of the things that i try to do is

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,360
if we have like work to be done like

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,600
there's always doc's work to be done

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,880
there's always like some of these tasks

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,960
to be done so

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,559
instead of like me trying to say oh i'll

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,320
just go and do that some of the things i

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,720
just opened up issues for

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,399
and i'll like specifically tag them with

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,520
like the first issue

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,559
so that people can say that well

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,600
they will go and open them so if you

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,279
go through the um if we go to

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,640
the issues uh issues page and yeah you

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,240
can see

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
issues page and you try and you click on

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,960
open a new issue

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,360
um then this was something we did

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,279
intentionally there like if you

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,919
uh if you click on bug report i would

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,080
say yep

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,440
so we of course are used to github issue

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,640
templates and if you scroll down there

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,000
to the bottom

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
uh it would we have there you can file

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,120
the bug

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,960
but you know if you then we ask you are

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,159
you willing to submit you know a pr to

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,279
fix this issue so we

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,080
are actively asking people if they want

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,039
to help

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,880
the project and i'll and i put that part

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,760
in their parentheses after if you say

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
yes

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,519
because some people say yeah i would

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,519
like to contribute but i don't know how

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,960
so we're trying to put that out there

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,279
like if you need help

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
submitting a pr then we will help you

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,159
you know like i'm saying

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,799
i will spend some we will spend some

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,559
time to help you

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,240
submit a pr to this project whether it

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,360
be for docs or code or

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,039
test or whatever so that's

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,799
like i said we try to put that out there

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,240
up front

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,600
to help people or to remove that barrier

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,159
of people saying well i don't know how

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,279
to use

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,120
github or i don't know how to

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,279
do this or that on git so i don't know

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,360
how to use the command line with git so

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,480
it was like that's fine you can we can

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,000
there are a couple of ways you can

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,120
contribute to the project without

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,720
actually having to download the git

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,480
client and do it that way nice

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,039
i did a call out in the chat too as well

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,360
i asked if anybody uses angular or ngrx

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,840
and

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,000
uh prucha uh who's our our fellow uh

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,679
our war eagle in the chat uh he had

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
mentioned he wished he uh he used it

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,840
like six or seven years ago because he's

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
using uh

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,679
local storage to manage state um okay

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,240
which is a good first step um but you

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,760
quickly

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,640
you learn like i'm using local storage

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,360
for my stuff uh but my project's small

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,840
but i have every intention to advance

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
myself

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,039
out of that once it i start adding too

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,240
much stuff to it

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,279
um yeah but yeah that's a good call-out

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,039
yeah i will say that

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,760
yeah the yeah i will i will

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,799
say up front that the just because of

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,960
ngrx build

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,600
being built on top of rxjs that there's

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,279
a learning curve to be had there yeah

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,960
and there are certain applications for

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,080
it where you would use it

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,240
uh but yeah it what

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,360
the targ what you know what we targeted

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,760
like i said targeting

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,519
managing state and you know some apps

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,880
just you know don't need it

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,080
but if you get to a certain point where

00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
you're managing a lot of state in

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,480
different places

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,720
that's where you uh get into

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,320
where why you would start to use ngrx in

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,200
the in your project so

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,880
that's always my pitch to people of uh

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,679
in the at least in the angular community

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,880
about

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,360
whether you should use it or not because

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
it help

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,919
what it what it does is it has a focus

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,640
and we try to make that

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,360
the best like focus or focus that and

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,360
making it as best we can

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,880
excellent um curious though

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,120
is there any examples that we could look

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,799
at where ngrx is being used like do you

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,080
have any to do apps or

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,440
stuff like that that's sort of explore

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,039
the reactivity yeah sure so we have an

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:49,440
example application that's in the

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:53,840
uh repo itself and where does that live

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,840
it's under projects

00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:01,279
and it's the example app so this is our

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,519
application that that we use

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,519
to

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,280
our application that we have baked a lot

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,280
of our best practices

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,079
in uh for the project uh

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,320
so that you can if you're like new to

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,200
using ngrx you can look at this example

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,159
app

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,919
and see how it works and you can run

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,280
this app locally if you you know clone

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,200
the project

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,599
and you can also or you can run it

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,440
locally and we do have another

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,359
place where the where you can

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,119
see the application running i'm just

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,639
trying to bring it up here

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:44,240
or okay you can bring it up locally

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,679
uh that one should be up to date

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,440
but it depends on how long this may be

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
it may be out of date i'm pretty sure

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,720
but there's a there's a small

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,000
application that you can um look at

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,800
for just right getting it running yeah

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,880
on your local

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,520
can i um what do i clone something

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,040
because i'm happy to clone something and

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,720
yeah sure either yeah if you want to

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,480
clone it you can

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,000
uh do that is it the uh full project

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,560
then yeah

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
okay yeah actually i might even just

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,720
i'll clone it

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,000
yeah if you if all right i have it here

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,960
locally also if you want me to just

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,640
bring it up but

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,320
um actually if you have it go ahead and

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,280
share your screen and then

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,599
okay that way no one has to watch me npm

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
install

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:35,550
yeah okay

00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,550
[Music]

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,920
okay so this is the uh if you can see my

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
browser screen okay here

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,400
[Music]

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
uh this is the example that i mentioned

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,440
before and

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,040
uh it's it's like a book manager a book

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
collection or a bookstore application

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,839
where you can log in

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,760
you see my collection of books uh you

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,960
can go on browse books

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,760
or search for angular

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,119
and you can search for books there you

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,480
choose a book

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,359
uh add it to your collection and then if

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,599
you go back to

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,800
my collection you'll see uh the book

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,160
that you've added there and this is

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,599
actually using the

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,960
google books api yeah to

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,160
list or for the search results and

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,880
like it's a it's a minimum uh

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,000
pretty minimum application but it goes

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,400
through a lot of the

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,359
common use cases that you would have uh

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,200
with building

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,839
a reactive application a reactive

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,839
angular application with

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,880
ngrx so you can log out

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,680
and the biggest one of the big features

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,599
that we

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,440
show for uh show for the project

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,160
is the redux dev tools which

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,160
bring it up here

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,960
uh so it shows it has that same likes it

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,200
has that same integration with

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,640
like the time travel stuff yeah the time

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,960
traveling yep

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,800
so we showed all your log of actions

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,480
that you've done as you've navigated

00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
through the application

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,359
and you can use the time traveling to go

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,400
back

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:23,680
if i can jump here

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,160
let me click on it

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,839
so you can see the what the state of the

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,359
application was at that particular point

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,200
in time

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,440
um and jump back through uh once the

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,480
you know the books are books collections

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,960
are loaded

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
you can go through it that way uh so

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
yeah like i said we have full

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,320
integration with the

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,320
redux dev tools and this is more

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,839
a reference application that people can

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,320
use to

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,880
to go through the go through the app uh

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,960
if your

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,119
guests that haven't used it before can

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,079
you explain the the power of having the

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,960
time travel

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,480
uh stuff like for like debugging for

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,119
exception handling

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,800
like uh this is something i used a lot

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
in uh my previous uh

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,000
employer we had set up the redux dev

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,640
tools and we're able to

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,079
have exception handling uh and like for

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,720
for bug tracking but can you explain

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,560
that i guess

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,079
the the power of that on from your

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,520
perspective

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,200
yeah so with that when we use the

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,320
redux dev tools on other

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,560
projects uh it ke

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,440
it tracks the all these states that

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,200
happen if you're

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,720
if you're using it for you know a lot of

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
your parts every application then you

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,920
can

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,280
like say track those states and um

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,960
over time there's states that your

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,280
application was in over time

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,359
and what we used that in a previous

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
application is that we would use that to

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,040
uh we used it in a couple of ways for

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,320
like local development

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,920
we would we could walk back how the

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,119
application was running at any given

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,880
point in time

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,320
and using the using the the jump

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,960
uh or using the redux dev tools to jump

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,680
back to

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,200
a certain point in time or jump forward

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,320
to a certain point in time of

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,440
where that where the application was uh

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,240
also we used it for debugging to where

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,680
you could download a snapshot of the

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,880
state of the application at

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,320
at a point in time and like inspect

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,640
especially if an error occurred you

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,800
could expect to see what you know

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,400
what the application state of the

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,880
application was in

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
at that point in time when uh when that

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,119
error happened and we would use that

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,800
as a another debugging tool to

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,880
see give you some information about how

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,520
to fix that issue

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,040
so they provided a lot of it it gives

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,480
you more information that you wouldn't

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,200
normally have

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,680
uh as you're building an application

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,440
because

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,480
normally your your those things are

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,079
isolated within smaller silos or in

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,520
case of angular you're just using like

00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,440
regular services

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,800
that don't have any knowledge of you

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,119
know there's they aren't

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,119
bound to like a global state container

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,680
that you can track

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,319
so that information for a lot of people

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
when they

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,640
are new to it or provides a lot of

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,040
information if you're new to using the

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
pattern

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,920
okay very cool and are we able to see um

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,680
how that sort of works under the hood so

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,520
like i don't know if this is the

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,119
example app has um code that supports

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,400
this

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,400
yeah it's probably in the repo

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,079
as far as the time traveling yeah i mean

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,160
i i

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,119
want to wrap my brain around the um how

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
ngrx

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,319
handles that so and the things like

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,240
observables

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,599
um okay as well yeah so

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:54,160
um indirect store itself

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:57,680
uh i can bring up the

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:01,599
engine indirect store itself uh uses

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,440
we use observables as the main api to

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,119
implement the redux pattern so i will

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,200
open

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:14,880
up the repo here and if i go under

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,000
modules store

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
source uh the main thing that you're

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,480
going to

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
interact with uh in android's

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,119
application is the store

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,640
okay so the store is a service

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,319
that you can inject anywhere in your

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,160
angular application

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,680
that lets you do a couple of things it

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,839
lets you dispatch actions

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:39,440
unless you select state from the store

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,720
and for the example application

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,800
uh when we do a search we're

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,800
we're following this cycle of when you

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,200
go to this page you enter a search you

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,599
dispatch an action to

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,960
initiate the loading of that data and

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,119
then you handle that

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,880
action to the actions that come out of

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,200
that those events to

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,640
perform those uh perform particular

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,920
tasks

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,079
so the store itself is a service

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,280
that lets you select state and dispatch

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,119
actions

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,640
and then if we go into the

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,359
uh state service uh the part

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,839
where those things come together is

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,119
right

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,960
uh here so we are listening to

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,160
like the latest um reducer which is

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,200
listening for

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,599
state changes and the actions

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,920
that so you have a given piece of state

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,040
and a particular action that happens

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,880
and we are scanning those actions and

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,599
those state changes to produce new

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,119
states

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,560
okay um so in our

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,839
and you can see and as i mentioned

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,400
before you can see those in the

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,160
dev tools uh that was the extension

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,760
itself

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,560
but the dev tools itself uh

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
what we're doing is we're taking the

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,920
previous state

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,200
in an action and reflecting a new state

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,359
so the store itself is a

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:15,040
global way of tracking that

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,800
and then the dev tools like i said allow

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,920
you to

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,960
uh see that information and track that

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,960
information

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,640
so i'm curious if um so i've i've also

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,839
used angular and i actually stopped

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,440
using angular around the time you

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,440
started using angular

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,079
so i actually got into react around that

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,720
time but um so i've got the context of

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,560
redux

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,040
and we have in the chat had mentioned

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,280
around using local storage

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,200
so like knowing that redux also i don't

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,359
know oh you have to chat up i didn't

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,960
send a chat but you found your way there

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,680
but um i don't know if everybody has

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,200
the quite has the context of like the

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,800
power that we're sort of looking at and

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,640
sort of like the evolution

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,720
of state management for you know

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,359
front-end focused applications

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,000
uh i'm curious if angular are there

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,319
multiple ways to handle state and store

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
in angular or is ngrx like the way

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,480
people are

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,599
approaching it these days yeah so there

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,119
are um multiple ways to manage state

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,319
uh within angular the angular itself has

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,800
you know built or has uh services

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,359
themselves that you can or services that

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,880
you can build yourself that are

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,680
uh you can use uh rxjs directly

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,800
as a and use those in more of an

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,319
isolated way

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,119
yeah so you can just you can take a

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,359
service and you can expose some

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,800
observables on that service and use that

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,720
to manage the state

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,000
of a particular feature or a particular

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,560
page

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,680
within your application so yeah angular

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,160
has

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,880
has a mechanism to allow you to manage

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,800
state

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,720
as opposed to using like local storage

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,520
you could inject a service

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,280
and manage that kind of in-memory in

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,319
that way

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,680
but like i said those are isolated a

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,920
smaller

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,599
i guess in a smaller sample of state

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,640
management as opposed to

00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,880
something more wide like uh redux

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,119
okay yeah and is there like a point

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,240
where you would want to introduce

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,520
ngrx into a project like or should you

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,560
start with a template or a boilerplate

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,960
i'll see see i'll let you in a little

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,640
tip

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,079
a little too boilerplate is my trigger

00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,119
word no

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,720
okay i'll just get it no just get it

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,200
yeah um but yeah there's uh

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,319
we do have like over the time over the

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,680
life of the project

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,960
we have evolved some of rules

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,440
around would you when you would

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,680
introduce ngrx into your project

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,960
we call them the uh sherry principal

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,720
which is a person

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,240
uh it's actually the person that we

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,760
named the principal as of is a person

00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,800
who used to work with right that i used

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,040
to work with

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,960
and her name's sherry so we kind of

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,000
modeled those after

00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,319
after uh or so yeah there are

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,520
rules or things that you would like

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,839
these conditions that

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,280
you know injuries make or is a good fit

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,720
for your project yeah

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,599
and the sherry principle is uh

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,640
noted here uh as far as managing state

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,200
you have state that's

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,680
accessed by many components of services

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,000
a

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,359
state that just persisted and hydrated

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,200
from external storage

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,400
i think local storage is a good example

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,280
of that

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,040
to where you would you could use you

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,319
could manage your local storage but as

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,280
far as hydrating it

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,359
and bringing it back when your

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,640
application comes up you would

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,000
expose that through ngrx or

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,240
state that's available when you're

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,920
coming and leaving pages

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,560
or a state that needs to be managed by a

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,400
side effect or even if you have multiple

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,640
places in your application that

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,079
are like that data is impacted from

00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,920
multiple places

00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,760
and we usually use like authentication

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,079
as a good example of that

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,760
you can log in and manage your

00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,000
authentication

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,920
of plenty of features features are going

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,720
to use it you could have multiple ways

00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,560
to log

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,400
log in and are logged out of your

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,560
application to trigger

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,560
uh or actions to trigger those events of

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,599
lotting out

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:23,119
so those would be these are

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,680
the like i said we came up with these um

00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,440
this rule of principle and these are the

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,440
things that you would consider

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,800
as far as using it because these things

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,280
tend to come up

00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,680
more and more in larger scale projects

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,760
larger scale angular projects

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,960
and it helps you provide that

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,880
process and pattern to use across

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,359
teams where you have this consistent way

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,119
of your building these features

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,040
yeah and that's not to say that you

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,800
can't use you know service

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,640
the other pattern that you would use in

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,079
angular is more or less a service with a

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,280
subject pattern

00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,280
and um that's a good pattern but in some

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,680
cases only get you so far

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,000
and this is kind of the next step of you

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,720
have a lot of state in a lot of places

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,040
where you want to use it there yeah and

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,800
uh

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,559
i really like this principle i like that

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,839
um there's like some a very good

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,680
guideline in steps

00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,880
and i get i get the i get the pushback

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,400
on having a boilerplate

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,000
because like you don't really need all

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
those problems solved right off the bat

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,839
like it's better to introduce the

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,119
solutions when you have the problem

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,079
as opposed to creating a bunch of

00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,640
problems uh that you don't have yes

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:33,119
we don't want to get into the you had

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,640
one problem and now you're using ngrx

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,760
now you have two problems we don't want

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,640
to

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,160
we don't want to do that so but yeah we

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,520
do have i'll go ahead and mention here

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,000
while we're on here we

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,839
the service with the subject pattern is

00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,240
like i said one that you can use

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,000
and we're adding an additional library

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,400
to the platform

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,359
that handles that situation also so it

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,280
gives you a more standardized way of

00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,800
using a service or rather than using a

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,359
service with a subject

00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,599
something that lives with the works with

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,000
the life cycle of your components

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,200
unless you still build these observable

00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,200
streams

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,559
so we're we're we're basically coming at

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,520
it from both ends if you need something

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,440
locally

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,720
locally to manage state we got something

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,720
for you there if you need something

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,079
that's more wide and shared

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,079
we're working on that too excellent

00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,680
so i'm curious if we can transition to

00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,079
uh the repo itself

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,200
um like this this open source friday is

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,280
all about trying to

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,960
have contributions and things to work on

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,079
you know on friday a lot of people if

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,000
you're a developer

00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,200
tends to be a slower day like a lot of

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,040
people

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,720
still deploy on fridays but like people

00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,119
have you know

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,880
slowed down who is deploying on fridays

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,559
people who write tests

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,359
okay i don't as a rule i don't deploy on

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,839
fridays

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,599
yeah and that's uh more or less because

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,559
i want my weekend

00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,480
to be nice and not worrisome about

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,359
breaking somebody's app who tried to

00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,119
upgrade on a friday yeah yeah actually

00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,119
so my side project that i do i actually

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,319
do deploy on a friday because i'm

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,079
i prepare myself for the weekend to uh

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,359
pay attention to it uh because during

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,720
the week it's very hard to pay attention

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,880
to my side projects

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,839
um yeah so if i deploy it on monday and

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,559
then i have to take

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,000
half a day to re-fix the stuff i broke

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,640
uh so i had the inverse but mainly

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,599
because it's

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,720
it's open source and it's not my 100

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,559
priority

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,760
um but yeah let's talk about

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,760
contributing and

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,960
you had mentioned documentation i'm

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,599
curious if there's like a

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,400
are there any sort of like big things or

00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,119
big pushes that

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,599
ngrx is having right now that people can

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,640
see if they want to contribute to

00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,119
yeah so i either i can drive or you can

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,359
drive

00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,960
yeah why don't we uh you switch back and

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:48,640
i'll share my screen

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,000
sure excellent

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,040
and then that way i can sort of uh oop

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,040
i think this is the one uh

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,040
i can help you you can navigate me

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,000
through if i was trying to contribute as

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,160
well so

00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,760
um yeah i think so far we just i think

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,839
we just looked at the documentation

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,280
uh and we got that far so you could

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,520
either like explain the project and how

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
it's

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,880
sort of set up or we can start talking

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,520
about maybe some of the the big pushes

00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,440
that you have

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,040
for the project so you you decide on

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,520
that end

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,599
yeah so yeah i'll talk about the the

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,800
project in general and then we can

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,520
drill into how people can contribute uh

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,640
so the uh you just want me to talk about

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,640
like the project structure

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,000
yeah i'd be curious because like i see

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,839
this word platform

00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,119
uh and i don't i've never seen actually

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,800
a lot of times i see projects

00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,319
like ngrx slash ngrx um oh yeah so like

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,079
what was the decision

00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:42,160
angular yeah so what was the decision

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:45,359
for making it platform and not

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,720
in grx again yeah so

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,079
the original uh repo for the project was

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,640
just indirect

00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,800
store and we had well it started out

00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,400
with ngrx store and then we

00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:01,520
expanded to include uh ndrxfx

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,319
which is a library for handling side

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,680
effects

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:07,040
okay and uh router store is integrating

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,680
with angular router

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,880
and uh entity was a separate library

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,800
yeah we have a

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,880
lot of libraries here like these uh ones

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,040
here are actually nightly build or

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,800
builds that we run that we publish on

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,480
every build of master

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:26,640
or maine or whichever one you prefer

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:30,079
yeah you decide but uh yeah you decide

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,599
but yeah we started out with store uh so

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,520
then we have store that or these other

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,720
libraries depend on store so we were

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,800
coordinating

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,000
like the releases between the different

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,359
projects before

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,359
on github so we ended up uh saying we're

00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,440
going to move everything to a mono repo

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,040
it would be easier for us to manage that

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,040
way and instead of

00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:55,040
doing the ngrx ngrx uh thing we told we

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,599
were saying that interx

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,920
is a platform or a framework consider

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,680
we're calling a framework of libraries

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,319
so we're considered more of a platform

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,920
that

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,000
could contain many libraries that you

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,920
can use in your

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,720
projects can you explain the nightly

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,000
build as well and how that works

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,520
right so every time we get

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
pr or prs when people open prs and we go

00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,839
through

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,280
you know the process of review and

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:25,280
approving

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:28,559
each one of those once the pr is merged

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,760
we're using circle ci for that right now

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,880
but uh circle ci we have a job set up

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,240
that only looks at when uh the master

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,240
branch is built

00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,520
or someone merged something into the

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,880
master branch

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,960
and we go and build all of our projects

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,920
and then we publish them to

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,440
github repos for people who want to like

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,960
the latest and greatest if you want to

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,000
go and get

00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,400
uh because we we're

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,160
using version or versioning because

00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,839
we're using versioning so that we don't

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,839
of course we don't break people

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,839
break people's projects but if you're

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,359
like i want to live on the bleeding edge

00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:09,359
uh we publish those those builds to

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,800
github repos and then you can add those

00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,040
repos to your

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,960
project directly i've seen a lot of uh a

00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,720
couple projects use things like lerna

00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,119
so is it basically the same thing but

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,480
instead of you have a giant monorepo

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,680
you're actually creating separate repos

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,520
right for the for the distribution uh

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,920
we're using a mono repo

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,079
and we're uh we're we're not using

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,680
learner we're using uh nx which is

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:39,680
a different uh uh open source project

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:43,200
that's managed by my job where i work

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,240
okay so is it not uh or i guess narwhal

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,839
then as you're

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,520
yeah there we go yeah normal yeah

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,640
narwhal manages uh

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,760
nx and i work on that project also so nx

00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,920
is an open source

00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:58,319
another open source project which is a

00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,079
dev tools for mono repos or open source

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,970
toolkit for mono repos oh

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,599
someone's got a big data failure

00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:09,599
[Laughter]

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:11,280
nice um you've been exposed

00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,799
yeah there you go you got to deploy the

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,920
friday now

00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:18,480
oh under under the gun

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,200
under the gun to get that that badge

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:35,839
fixed

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:35,839
yeah but yeah we use uh we were

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,359
uh that we can finish talking through i

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,839
think where we left off is we were

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,280
actually

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,520
trying to figure out how to contribute

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:49,839
to narwhal uh itself

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,839
actually no narwhal ngrx uh

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,559
okay so my thought is

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,799
let's continue we talked about the

00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,319
building so that's where we were nx

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,559
actually was talking about the sort of

00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,920
building we stop at nx

00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,920
and that's what's actually the

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,440
automation to build those

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,520
those projects so uh

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,040
i'm curious could we finish the thought

00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,359
on how nx works and how

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,640
the automation is hitting like is that

00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:20,079
connected to circle ci

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:23,839
or where the process of the pr does it

00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:26,960
actually ship yeah so the

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:30,880
uh if we go into the circle ci

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:34,079
uh folder there dot circle ci yeah

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,680
yeah we can look at that and uh

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:41,119
that config file there yep

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,640
so if we scroll down to the

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,160
uh the circle see it uh jobs and

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,079
workflows and we have

00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,599
workflows to find at the bottom of the

00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,680
file

00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:56,880
so each time uh go all the way down to

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,880
the bottom of the file there

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,680
yeah as you can see we're building a few

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,559
we're running a few

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,480
things automated tests and making sure

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,960
the project builds and everything

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,720
yeah if you scroll up a little bit until

00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,880
you get to

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,559
uh deploy yeah the deploy job there

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,920
uh down a little further what line

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,839
number is this oh there we go

00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,119
420 yeah 427. so we use

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:30,160
uh this deploy job so that anytime

00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:33,359
anyone merges uh something

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,000
into the deploy job or deploy job is

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,799
defined

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,079
up higher in the configuration file but

00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,799
this only builds

00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,319
this job only runs when mergers are made

00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:46,559
into the master branch

00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:50,960
yeah and so uh what that deploy job does

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,839
is we unarchive or we unarchive our

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,390
cache and we run

00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,000
a

00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:58,319
[Music]

00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,319
typescript or a node script that's

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:02,000
written in typescript

00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,760
that actually does the deployment of

00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,599
those uh packages

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,000
and if you want to look at that what

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:11,839
that job actually looks like we can

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,240
uh yeah how do i get to the um the jobs

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,319
well first i get back to the top of this

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,960
yeah so just go back to the platform or

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,960
go back to the yep rooted the project

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,240
and if you look under the build uh

00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,200
directory

00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,000
there we have a few uh scripts here that

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,240
we use

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:36,240
to run particular jobs

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:39,760
so we have the deploy build uh

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,559
script there and what this uh script

00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,000
does

00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,599
and we can look further as far as the

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,280
tasks it does

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,880
but it does two things we have it builds

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,640
all the projects

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,440
and or the job the circle ci job builds

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,920
the projects

00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,680
and then we use those build artifacts to

00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,240
deploy them to

00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,000
github repos and also to deploy the

00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,839
latest version of the documentation

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,359
to next.ngrx.io

00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,680
which people can see like i said if you

00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,920
want to see the latest and greatest of

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,119
what was successfully built

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,760
uh on that branch then you can use that

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,480
so if we go back one directory real

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,640
quick

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:26,000
to the tasks file

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:29,280
let me show how that works and

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,920
if we scroll down there is a

00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:36,319
job there that yeah there's if we scroll

00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:39,200
back up to a little bit to 60 around 60

00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,079
a little bit more i believe yep right

00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:43,200
here

00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,599
so this is the publish to repo

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,200
job to where we get each package that is

00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,079
defined in the

00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,960
in the repo yeah and we we're using a

00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,319
convention of

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:58,559
whatever the package name dash builds

00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:00,799
so we we get each project and we

00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,000
uh say this is where you know the build

01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,000
artifacts for those

01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,520
that project is this is where we're

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,079
going to publish it and then we use the

01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,920
prepare

01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,400
and publish function to do the rest of

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,960
the work

01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,160
we can scroll down to see where the

01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,720
prepare and publish

01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,760
part of it is so what we do with the

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,799
prepare and publish

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,839
is we get you know who the committer

01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:27,440
of that pr was

01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:30,000
and we create a temporary directory and

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,640
we copy those build artifacts into that

01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,599
directory and we make a commit

01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:37,359
and then we push we push well we only

01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,880
pull the latest commit from the current

01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:42,160
bill repo

01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,119
and then we take a copy of the build

01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,000
artifacts

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,480
and push those push the latest build

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,079
artifacts to

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,599
push the latest build artifacts to that

01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,200
repo

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,200
for each one of the for each one of the

01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,319
projects so every time

01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:01,040
someone merges in the pr we do the

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,760
the builds so that our believe we're up

01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,720
to seven

01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,839
packages now uh you can go and get each

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,799
one of those

01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,880
the latest of what's on master as far as

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,880
each one of those packages go

01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,079
okay how old is this this whole

01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,280
scripting process

01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,599
of identifying uh

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,079
builds and then creating pre uh prs for

01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,680
this and stuff

01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,920
uh so the a lot of the the

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,799
most of it is like custom tooling to

01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,680
where we're

01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:33,680
looking at the we're looking at the

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,000
project each project has

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,359
a certain structure and has a certain

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,680
build file in it

01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:41,599
so we're currently looking at that to

01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,160
determine which projects need to be

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,160
built

01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:48,160
and shipped um but we're

01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,559
as because we're going to say go back to

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,280
nx again

01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,640
we can use that more and well you have

01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,400
to go back there about the same we can

01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,240
it gives us project information that we

01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,920
can use to do that more efficiently as

01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,880
opposed to looking at like the directory

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,280
structure

01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:06,720
okay i'm curious if uh if you all uh

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:09,839
looked into github actions before

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,839
i have not looked into them directly

01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,760
i have not looked into it extensively i

01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,880
think we signed up for

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,680
i definitely signed up for the veda um a

01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,960
while back

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,920
but haven't looked at trying to see what

01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,760
the

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,920
configuration would be to do that yeah

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,720
so it's a it seems very similar so i

01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,920
have a

01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,200
project that i've been working on i

01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,319
mentioned this earlier in the stream

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,319
with uh iffy

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:34,400
uh which is called open source and i

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:38,240
have it's not as complicated as narwhal

01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,160
um or nx rather um or even like ngrx's

01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,280
setup because it's a much smaller

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,200
project but

01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,599
i'm actually doing i don't think the

01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,720
actual builds i'm syncing the issues

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,680
uh between repos so i have this repo

01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,960
which is

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,440
um it actually lives here under open

01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,240
source

01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,680
and then goals template so anybody who

01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,559
creates a new repo based on this

01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,280
template

01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,240
then also brings the actions along for

01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,240
the ride

01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,520
and then this this action itself is

01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,520
supposed to

01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,799
uh for example this one syncs uh this

01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,480
one's a little simpler

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,839
actually because i'm using another

01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,640
action that

01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:16,319
fork bacon which basically it's meant to

01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,720
every time you fork a project

01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:19,599
it keeps your your um the main branch up

01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,720
to date

01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:26,079
um so this is every

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,760
every day at 2 am uh utc my my main

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,280
branch is going to be updated

01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,520
every day so that way i don't have to

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,039
worry about hey new changes i'm not

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,400
tracking them but i want to i want to

01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,680
contribute to a project and

01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,680
i think a lot of times people will just

01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,640
do like they'll delete the repo and then

01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,839
fork it again

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,839
so that way they get the latest without

01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,880
needing to like you know fetch origin

01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,160
and then you know

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,920
push back up to their branch um yeah

01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,520
so i say so you're using more of a

01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,839
distributed um

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,720
approach but you're syncing everything

01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,720
up um

01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,240
automatically yeah it's yeah

01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,920
automatically and it's it's built with

01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,520
actions and like the fact that this

01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,039
action can go along for the ride no one

01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,119
has to sign up for actions like it's

01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,839
already built into the the product now

01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,400
um it was beta before um but the beauty

01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,920
of this

01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,920
is i have two different repos that are

01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,760
now staying in sync with each other

01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,039
and they don't even know anything about

01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,520
each other like i just know that

01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,880
it actually works um so i bring that up

01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,760
because like it seems like

01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,480
uh your your scripts probably pre-date

01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,280
actions

01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,799
um so i wouldn't recommend you start

01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,160
deleting stuff and switching over

01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:30,160
uh by any means but uh i i just started

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,079
while you were going through it now

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,720
you started the waiting uh i could hear

01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,760
you clicking away on your your keyboard

01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,599
there you go excellent yeah but i i

01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,079
i'm sorry i bring that up because the

01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:45,359
the understand the concept of this build

01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:48,559
uh and the scripting um i love

01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,880
having like ideas of automation um and

01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,799
like

01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,000
if you have one repo that's doing one

01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:55,280
something the one way

01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,240
like i imagine the way you're doing well

01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,880
nx exists because the way that narwhal

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,720
was doing it

01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,960
probably they probably end up sharing

01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,440
that to other projects like ngrx

01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,960
um so i think what i'm getting at is

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,280
there's a lot of solved problems and i

01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,119
think a lot of people have

01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,400
approached solving it themselves and

01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,680
then finding out that

01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,520
it's hard to maintain something like

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,599
this when you could just actually

01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,039
follow brandon and follow ndrx and see

01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,160
how they're doing it and just copy and

01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,240
paste that like crazy

01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,200
yeah i would yeah that like i said that

01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,960
was hand

01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,119
hand rolled and i would definitely uh

01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,880
if you know the like i said the mono

01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,160
repo makes coordinating that

01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,880
simpler but yeah if i was if i was using

01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,400
a multi-repo approach then i would

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,520
definitely look at more

01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,319
coordination and coordination between

01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,000
the repos

01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:50,319
because we were doing that before and it

01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,440
was it was a pain so

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,559
well excellent um so i i guess i wanted

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,839
to transition us to

01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,520
i'm not sure if i'm gonna be able to

01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,640
find out how our faces are gonna get

01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,839
back on the screen

01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,079
um okay that was uh

01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:06,480
yeah i i guess this is my the limitation

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,200
of me uh

01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,480
not showing hide feeding hide video

01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,520
panel

01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,319
no anyway if anybody in the chat knows

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,039
how to use zoom

01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:19,039
uh please let me know because as soon as

01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,839
we yeah we can

01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,720
i can't talk to talk about uh how at

01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:28,400
least from my documentation page you can

01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:32,799
contribute there okay so if you go to

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:35,200
uh ngrx dot io uh the documentation site

01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,200
itself

01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:47,839
yep so uh because you click on the docs

01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,839
link there at the top

01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:55,440
so yeah on the on the uh each page

01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:56,880
right now has a small pencil if you see

01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,319
there at the top right corner of the

01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,359
page

01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:02,960
and what that does is if you actually

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:06,079
want to make a change

01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,559
uh to this project like yeah i guess you

01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,760
have to

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:11,839
have a yeah work of it but

01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,359
yeah if you want to make a change to the

01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:15,680
actual document

01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:17,839
and it takes you directly to the page

01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,599
and like the content that you can edit

01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,960
uh directly here so you don't have to

01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,599
have any

01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,960
uh github all right we're using like the

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,359
github links

01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,119
and pointing to the files to let you be

01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,960
able to edit directly there

01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,559
and if you'd like if you want to just do

01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,760
a one line or change or you're like

01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,920
correcting some grammar

01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,039
and you want to open the pr that way

01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,319
that's a definitely

01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:43,599
easy way to contribute uh

01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:45,760
in that way if like say if it's not um

01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,839
code there could be you know places in

01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,880
code where you can do that too but

01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,039
at least from straight from our

01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,720
documentation page we try to provide

01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,559
less friction for you to

01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,160
contribute in that way yeah are there

01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:58,000
any like clear areas that where the

01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,119
documentation is lacking that maybe

01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,200
people can jump into

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,960
because like i mentioned if i'm a brand

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,319
new um

01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,240
like ngrx user uh i might want to

01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,680
start using androx today like i've got a

01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,839
i've got a problem i want to solve

01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,440
i've i've understand observable now it's

01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,560
like i want to

01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,319
basically or i want to and have

01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,839
time travel debugging as part of my

01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,920
project like

01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,960
is there some clear areas uh in the

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,159
documentation

01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,440
where people can focus on maybe solving

01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:28,719
that problem for their app but also

01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,839
solving that problem

01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:34,880
for the docs at the same time uh

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,319
yes the the documentation pages

01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,839
themselves always

01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:42,480
uh always cons accepting

01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,960
contributions for documentation uh in

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,239
the

01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,040
issues also like i mentioned before have

01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:51,120
some issues there that are long-standing

01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,120
issues for documentation ones that i

01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,120
haven't broken up specifically but you

01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,159
can probably look for

01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,319
them either under the docs label or

01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,600
probably if you see docs labeling me as

01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,799
the author

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,000
then you'll see we do have documentation

01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,640
ones here

01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,839
that are people can use to

01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:16,319
use these as uh guides for like yeah i

01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:18,799
have one there doctor rewrite guides

01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,239
that's one that's been a long long

01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:23,679
running one

01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:27,359
and so on this page oh wow this is uh

01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:30,080
ones that are yeah that one took

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,560
a little while to like hammer out some

01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,159
of the

01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,640
some of the details uh for that one

01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:38,080
but yeah the uh these are just some of

01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,679
the ones that we use like specifically

01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:43,120
tagged but

01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:45,199
the docs probably rewrite guides is the

01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,120
one that i guess the longest running one

01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:50,159
that i have put out there

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:52,560
to that people can contribute to as far

01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:55,920
as just areas that we are

01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,679
always looking to improve um

01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,520
and you can see like the pr's that have

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,239
come along the way where

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,040
other people have written updates and or

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,120
i have

01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,760
written some of those guides myself and

01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:11,040
we've had conversations about

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,960
uh what things will be good to update

01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,080
or what things people can areas people

01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,159
can contribute to

01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,760
yeah excellent yeah i think that's like

01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,239
a great thing to think about because i

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,560
think

01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:24,080
one thing that i talk about a lot is um

01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:28,320
the contributing md

01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:30,640
and like actually um actually turn my

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,679
second camera off um because i think

01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,440
we're gonna be good to go

01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,280
i was worried that my power was gonna

01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,760
shut off again but it seems to be

01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,560
fine um but yeah the one thing that i

01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,000
like to

01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,120
like to talk to people about like if

01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
you're gonna contribute or if you're

01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,320
gonna on board

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,920
to doing stuff try to make it better for

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,120
the next person that comes through so

01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,400
if you're going to use ngrx today

01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,760
try to find out places where you can

01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,280
improve the documentation where you had

01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,320
to sort of struggle through and figure

01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,480
out like ah

01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,159
i wish this was better docs one of my

01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,800
biggest gripes is like whenever someone

01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,480
like

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,000
uses something i wrote and then they're

01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,000
like hey this is broken

01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,360
and i'm like well could you at least

01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,719
just open an issue like i don't

01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,239
what do you want me to do you want me to

01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,520
like pair a program with you or you just

01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,719
want me to fix it

01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:16,719
turn it around the standard response is

01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:18,880
accepting prs well i saw your label too

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,800
as well where it said accepting prs

01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,400
um which i like that i like that like a

01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,320
actual car call out

01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,440
um which is like i think good first

01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,440
issue is great

01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,480
um but there's like expectation that

01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,600
this will be a new

01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,480
contributor on the project accepting prs

01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,480
could be it's not

01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,840
it's like good first issue but then some

01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,360
so like you expect

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,440
i guess you might be expecting someone

01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,400
with some expertise or even some

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,679
experience with the

01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:46,320
with the project is that the assumption

01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,120
yeah the yeah the good first issue is

01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,280
like

01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,960
you have never you may have never

01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,360
contributed to anything before

01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,560
you may not even know like how to and

01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,560
like i said we can walk

01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,239
help walk through you help you walk

01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,840
through that process

01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:01,760
for a good first issue and those are

01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,679
specifically for

01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,920
first-time contributors like if someone

01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,480
says if someone who comes along says

01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,080
i'll

01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,239
take that one and they're already a

01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,239
contributor then i'm like okay

01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,320
we'll just leave that one there because

01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:17,040
we want somebody who hasn't

01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,199
done it before uh who hasn't contributed

01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,360
before to actually take that one

01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:23,199
so that one is like a clear line of

01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,320
where that one is and the accepting pr's

01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,199
one is

01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,960
you know we could do this one or if the

01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:31,520
community wants to pick it up

01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,360
uh then you know we'll they're saying

01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,040
this is a thing that we could have

01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,440
and if you want to help contribute to or

01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,199
if you're like a recurring contributor

01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,800
then we're saying that you can come and

01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,679
you know take that one

01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,280
and and add your name to the to either

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,159
add your name to the list or

01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,640
further your name up the ranks yeah i

01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,040
like

01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,239
i honestly i really like that because um

01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,960
i've been doing a lot of

01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:56,480
trying to encourage other people to

01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,800
contribute to the stuff i do i

01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,080
write some blog posts and say like hey

01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,840
here's where the future of the project's

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:04,000
going like if you want to come along for

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,760
the ride here's the steps to do it

01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,520
i created a thing called the triage team

01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,040
as well which is um something i took

01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,000
from express.js

01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,560
um where if you want to onboard onto a

01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,159
project

01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,840
but you don't really know exactly where

01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,360
to start or how to actually like work

01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,000
with like this the scripting or the

01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,760
builds and stuff

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,520
like that but you can label issues like

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,840
or you can actually just debug like you

01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,239
can actually just use use the

01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,360
uh the library or the the product or

01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:31,120
whatever it is

01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,280
and then just like actually open up

01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,600
issues and like point out edge cases of

01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,600
like

01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,199
hey you know i was standing on one knee

01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,040
and i had two laptops open

01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,880
one would have linux and like stuff

01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,000
broke like okay document that tell me

01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:44,320
the versions

01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,320
tell me exactly how that sort of came to

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,000
like to being because most of my

01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,760
development's actually on the mac

01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,280
i don't really touch linux i don't touch

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,280
firefox because i just forget

01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,920
so like if it's a web like a web ui

01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:57,840
thing like i'm finding lots of css bugs

01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,560
and firefox that i have to change the

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,840
way i approach css um

01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,520
but that's good it's good to actually

01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,199
have that sort of exposure but i just

01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,600
don't constantly think about

01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,960
like i have this giant beefy windows pc

01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,159
i'm not even using for the stream which

01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,760
i should have apparently

01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,360
uh i would probably not wouldn't have

01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,120
had it die on me

01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,800
but um like i don't do enough windows

01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,320
stuff to be able to do that but i get a

01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,719
lot of contributions for people on

01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,719
windows and linux and stuff like that so

01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,480
i don't have to like have two laptops

01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:28,159
open at the same time so

01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,360
um i encourage um all the listeners and

01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,719
all the people who watch this after the

01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,400
fact like please

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,239
like consider yourself like a member of

01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,000
the triage team just by default like if

01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:38,400
you're new to the project

01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,199
try things out read the documentation if

01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,360
something is

01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:42,880
wrong like and this is like above

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,239
misspelling like typos because i think

01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,400
we get a lot of typos

01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,080
and that's fine but like if you don't

01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,360
understand like the words

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,120
or the verbiage like we spent the

01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,480
earlier part of the the chat talking

01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,480
about college football

01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,600
like if there's an analogy about college

01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,239
football and you're like ah this is

01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,719
missing

01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,679
me like you should let the maintainer

01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,520
know and be like hey

01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:04,320
could you like change this so the

01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,320
concept is actually understandable to me

01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,000
like you know somewhere else in the us

01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,040
or another country so

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:13,760
that's my thought yeah i definitely

01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,960
agree with that um try to make the

01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,640
project itself

01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,840
and from like code to documentation to

01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:23,040
contributing make that

01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,520
as accessible as possible so that

01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,960
people aren't like there are enough

01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,679
barriers as it is

01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,440
of people to have in their own brains as

01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,679
far as contributing go so we don't want

01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,159
to

01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,560
add anything else that will make that

01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,120
harder or mentally harder to do

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,080
so i'm always for trying to meet people

01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,640
where they are

01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,080
um as far as contributing and or

01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,800
reaching out to people who

01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,520
like openly use the project and say hey

01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,360
you know

01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,800
that would be a great pr if you wanted

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,400
to you know

01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,520
if you wanted to come add some of that

01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:58,000
back or you know you got some good ideas

01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,719
to share so i always try to encourage

01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
people

01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,880
to contribute to our project or even any

01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,320
other project or

01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,880
you know start their own eventually

01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,719
start their own project and kind of

01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,960
if that if ours was a launching point

01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,239
for someone else then i consider that a

01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,440
win

01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,800
yeah awesome so hopefully we got a good

01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,320
introduction to

01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,800
um ngrx i was gonna say narwhal again

01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,320
the the confusing of the names and the

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,440
the freezing on that it's just

01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,440
it's uh yeah the irony but uh i wanted

01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,400
to transit so much to um

01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:34,400
actual stars if you don't mind uh and

01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,840
i'd mention this uh i mentioned it's a

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,600
doc but we didn't actually

01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,120
specifically called us out our chat

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,320
about this before

01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,840
um but i'm curious if i bring up

01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:49,040
brandon roberts um

01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,560
curious if you have any stars i'm

01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,199
have some hey look at that

01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,480
uh yeah i don't probably don't use this

01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:59,120
as much as i should

01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,480
but the this last one here or the at

01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,880
least the first one in the list there

01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,080
was

01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:07,199
one that was pointed out to me recently

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:11,679
okay the black speakers in tech uh

01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,679
which i saw that on twitter um

01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,040
and quickstart yeah somebody had

01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,480
actually added me

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,880
at some point in time i wasn't even

01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,520
aware of it uh added me to the list

01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,400
which i shout out to that person but

01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,440
yeah

01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,080
oh i wonder if i'm here no i didn't make

01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,840
the list

01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,080
oh man ah there you go all right pr

01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,679
incoming

01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,679
there you go but i do see a lot of

01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,520
familiar names on this though

01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:39,120
as well very cool

01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,480
but yeah actually i'm really curious

01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:45,520
around this this twitch go

01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:48,239
oh okay so that one is

01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,760
i have been on this quest to use a

01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:52,800
chromebook

01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,800
for uh for

01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:59,840
a lot of my computing um

01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,239
and this was a way this project was a

01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,560
way

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:04,159
to run a twitch stream on your

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,120
chromebook because

01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:08,719
on your chromebook you can't use you can

01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,360
install linux apps

01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,239
but you can't access like the hardware

01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,480
directly

01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,840
yeah through the linux container so you

01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,560
can't run like obs

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,280
natively that way yeah so this was a way

01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,920
that

01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:24,080
a project i thought was pretty cool that

01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,159
you could

01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,679
attempt to do a twitch stream directly

01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:30,080
from your chromebook

01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,280
uh so i tried it out and it didn't work

01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,480
it worked okay

01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:37,679
uh yeah it did work uh it wasn't great

01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:39,520
but um but it was a step in the right

01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,800
direction for someone who like lives

01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,320
inside of a

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,159
lives inside of that environment who

01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,239
wants to like try doing an

01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,760
actual stream from there what was the

01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:49,120
what's the intention for using a

01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,640
chromebook for your

01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:56,159
your main editing and

01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:58,560
yeah so i'm i well i love the web

01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,679
and if i could do most of the things

01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,440
that um

01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,800
i normally do on the web i would choose

01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,520
that direction and a

01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,640
chromebook makes that pretty

01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,199
straightforward

01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,840
and it the other part of it is that it

01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:14,640
gives me the linux parts that i want

01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,640
and the other linux parts it tucks away

01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,000
the linux part that i don't want like i

01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,520
don't want to fiddle with desktop

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,480
settings and

01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,239
uh tweaking audio configuration and all

01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,800
that kind of stuff so

01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:28,640
a chromebook was an easy way for me to

01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,760
basically get on the web whenever i

01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,280
needed to end uh like release my brain

01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,640
from constantly having to

01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:40,239
tweak uh tinker and tweak things

01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:42,400
okay fair enough but yeah i'm uh

01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:44,080
yeah i've never would never even think

01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,360
to that you could do everything you

01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,520
could do with the chromebook

01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,719
like even the um that playground that we

01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,760
pulled up what was that

01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:55,120
stack blitz um like is that

01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:59,120
also um yeah stack which is all

01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:59,120
yep all web-based friendly yeah

01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,080
stack blitzes uh it's like it's become

01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,760
they have a different

01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,360
a lot of different projects here but yes

01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,040
for angular applications it's pretty

01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,159
much how you create

01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:13,920
your like sandbox we use it to yeah we

01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,760
use it to create yes like code sandbox

01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,719
we use it to create

01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,120
um if someone files an issue and you we

01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,360
use this to create like reproductions

01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,400
so we have like a can stack blitz that

01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:29,040
already has

01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:31,360
the ngrx packages installed and um

01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,560
you can fork that stack blitz and you

01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,639
know then it

01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,760
make it your own using you can fork it

01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:38,400
to your

01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,840
they you can log in with github and fork

01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,199
it that way

01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,560
and tweak the starter stack blitz and

01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:46,400
then you know submit that with your

01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,280
issue to say you know this is the issue

01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,040
i'm seeing

01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,400
here's an actual reproduction that kind

01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,760
of helps us out

01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,560
if we need to actually do something

01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,639
about it or not or tell someone that

01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,159
that's kind of the way it works so we're

01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,800
not gonna you know thank you for the

01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,960
issue we may not fix it

01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,040
so yeah definitely a way to spin up an

01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,920
angular project or even other

01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,719
angular reactor other projects quickly

01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,360
and

01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:14,480
edit them online or edit them everything

01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:17,679
you can do in the browser

01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:20,639
very cool yeah and um

01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,199
i don't know if i have i just spent some

01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,840
time

01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:25,440
talking about my stars uh with iffy

01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,480
before this call

01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:31,199
but i can scroll further down and uh

01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,400
okay cool yeah so here's one i do want

01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,719
to talk about

01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,320
and uh i talked about those ones already

01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,840
but use shopping cart is actually

01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,639
something i want to try out

01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,320
um so we actually we connected through

01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,600
twitter because i had a call out for

01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,880
for people who wanted to um who wanted

01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,280
me to sponsor them i was just looking

01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,920
for

01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,960
her black maintainers uh and you you

01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,600
responded

01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,400
um nick actually responded as well uh

01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,080
and nick actually

01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,520
maintains a project called use shopping

01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,840
cart which is

01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,040
kind of like a wrapper around the stripe

01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,679
api

01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,320
um and it gives you a shopping cart

01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,600
experience

01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,040
and it's open source and uh it actually

01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
solves a problem i'm looking to solve

01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,600
eventually

01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,199
i haven't had a chance to actually use

01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,040
it but i would not have actually ran

01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:18,560
into it if it wasn't for

01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:21,040
um me having a call out for for sponsors

01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,560
um so i highly recommend uh check the

01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,560
use shopping cart out i haven't used it

01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,639
myself but i will hopefully

01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,679
soon and i just want to give a call out

01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,120
to

01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:34,880
the github sponsors as well

01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:38,080
um you see i'm here um actually

01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,280
should we do the

01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,280
should show yours too as well

01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:48,639
yep so there you go you've got

01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,080
oh you have 20 sponsors oh wait no

01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,400
you're almost there

01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,760
yeah almost there 18. yeah last time i

01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,760
checked it was like

01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,600
it was less but i don't remember what it

01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,120
was but yeah definitely less but i see a

01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,760
lot of familiar faces on here too as

01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,639
well

01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,480
um yeah you've got the uh the ceo of

01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:07,760
github sponsoring him there you go

01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,800
i saw that and i was like huh okay oh

01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,440
hey

01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,560
any contributions i will i will gladly

01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,920
accept and

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,480
like i said i'm gonna use it to

01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,000
do more open source and pay it forward

01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,679
to others so

01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,880
yeah well i hope i mean i hope it goes a

01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,920
long way too as well because i think

01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,159
there's like

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,000
uh i i have a so i have a whole talk

01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,600
that i'm giving next uh in a couple

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,840
hours at june team conf

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,120
um but it's around like the value of

01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,239
sponsorship

01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,800
because a lot of people will give you

01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:37,679
mentorship but sponsorship is like the

01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,320
next level

01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,440
above that and i think people actually

01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,120
put like

01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,719
it's not even about money too it's like

01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,639
the investment yeah so

01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,000
actually putting your time in to invest

01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,880
in someone so when it comes to

01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,440
like i don't know anything about angular

01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,600
i don't think

01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,480
anything about like modern angular

01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,840
because i know like

01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,679
angularjs but like if someone gave me

01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,440
the time and said hey this is the value

01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,520
of using the platform like if i was

01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,239
working on a team like i would be so

01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,000
much further

01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:07,520
like i i'm pretty sure i can figure it

01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,480
out at this point i do a lot of

01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,520
javascript but

01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,800
what i'm getting at is like there's so

01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,520
many other people out there that could

01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,280
use

01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,960
just proper sponsorship like people

01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,280
actually coding up

01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,639
like coming up a site alongside them and

01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,880
actually giving them the time

01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,239
of day to like show them like the ropes

01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,960
and how to do that so

01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:26,560
i'm a big fan of the github sponsors for

01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,440
using it in that realm i know we've used

01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,360
it a lot for

01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:30,560
like elevating people who already doing

01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,600
stuff um

01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,920
but there are a lot of people who are

01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,239
like on the edge of like yeah

01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,199
going to like we just check again i'm

01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,120
going to bring up iffy because we had a

01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:41,040
longer conversation it's more recent but

01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,800
he was on the verge of actually stopping

01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,080
his open source project

01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,159
and then oh really and then somebody

01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,760
sponsored him and it gave him like

01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,360
basically the interest like i'm not just

01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,880
coding this for myself

01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,560
like a little side project taking up my

01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,159
nights and weekends like actually

01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:55,679
somebody's gonna use this so i will put

01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,400
my time into it if someone uses this

01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,159
thing

01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,920
but like is this like this weird

01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,040
awareness thing that

01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,280
if you don't know about it you're not

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,239
going to use it um so how do you get

01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,760
people to use it

01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:08,000
do you throw it up on github throw it up

01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,040
on npm and then hope for the best

01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,800
and there's like a lot of different

01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:13,600
opportunities for people to do to get

01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,880
exposure around with the work they do

01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:20,080
yeah definitely like like i said i was

01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,159
i was doing the nights and weekends work

01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,520
you know before the before the

01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,400
sponsorship thing came up

01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,159
and like i said it's not it's it's never

01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,440
been about the money for me but

01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,159
it's um i appreciate the you know that

01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,040
people

01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:36,320
have chosen to sponsor me and uh to

01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,520
continue those efforts

01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:41,440
um along the way so hopefully

01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,040
well i'm not saying hopefully i will you

01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,880
know look out for other people to

01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,520
sponsor also so that we can

01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,520
like say it and pay it forward yeah lift

01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,120
each other up so

01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,880
yeah i'm a big fan i appreciate you

01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,400
taking the time apologies on the the

01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,360
randomness of the uh

01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:58,719
that the zoom basically actually my mac

01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,760
is completely just dying

01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,440
um i think it's worthwhile the dongle

01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,920
itself i think is no longer producing

01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,080
power

01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,360
anymore so i had to plug it straight in

01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,480
so if anybody wants to know how i

01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:13,040
troubleshooted that's how i did it

01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,840
excellent cool but yeah um chat thanks

01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,840

01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:17,920
most of you i know some of us got like

01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,920
basically aborted once he got

01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,040
saw the black screen i'm not even sure

01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,560
if it was just

01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,679
i'm not sure if it cut out and no one

01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,440
was seeing it because i'm powering it

01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,159
from here but i'll look at the video

01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,000

01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:29,920
