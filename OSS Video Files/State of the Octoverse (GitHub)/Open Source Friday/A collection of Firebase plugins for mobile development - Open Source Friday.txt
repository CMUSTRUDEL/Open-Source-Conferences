	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
uh yeah um so yeah as you mentioned i'm

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,680
i'm mike and you know i work on the

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,880
flutter fire

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,160
open source project um but i'm also a

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,240
cto at a company called invites which

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
um my kind of purpose there is i kind of

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,920
oversee the technical direction of our

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,000
open source projects and

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
one of those of course is flutter fire

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
and some other ones like you mentioned

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
reacting to firebase and yeah so i

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,359
wanted to you had mentioned you have

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,359
like a quick demo that you want to share

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,079
that and show us what you can sort of

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,640
showcase with this tool these tools and

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
get a better

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
explanation uh yeah sure i can it's just

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
a brief demo

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,160
and just to kind of show you the code

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
and

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
just kind of the usage and the kind of

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,640
apps you can build and

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,879
say in this this kind of scenario um

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,960
in this demo i'm kind of using the cloud

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,320
firestore library which is a nosql

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,079
database

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
and which kind of scales really well

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
infinitely scalable

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
it has real time support those kinds of

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,039
things and

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,400
integrating it in your flutter app is

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,680
kind of pretty straightforward

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,960
really um yeah you just install

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,960
the package um by adding it to your

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,000
pubspec cloud fire store

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,720
obviously you need core as well

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
um and then yeah you initialize your app

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,280
and

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,360
and then yeah you can build out an

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
application from there so in this

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
example here is the example that's

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,240
officially on the

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
plugin itself so the source code is all

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,799
available

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
on github um but yeah in this example

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
it's just a basic movie app

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
um and it kind of showcases some of the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
features of firebase

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,360
you can do all sorts of querying and so

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,399
in this example we have

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,920
filtering save by a genre so sci-fi in

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,759
this case

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,439
and you can also sort by like descending

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,399
all sorts of things based on your own

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,399
data and

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah it's a basically the five-star sdk

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,640
on the second

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,120
and it's got a ton of querying apis

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
which we've kind of documented all here

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,080
yeah

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,680
and standard database you can do quite

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
some quite flexible querying

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
and then on top of that you have the

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,000
real-time aspect

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
so as an example of that is if i go on

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
the firebase back end now and

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
change the likes of say this one and

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,440
we'll come back to and you'll see it's

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
updated in real time

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
so i set that to 12 because it's tall

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,040
angry men

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,239
come back and 90's at the top says yes

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,280
all those kind of things are pretty cool

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,400
in my opinion

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
on how i kind of fire still works and

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,480
along with all the other firebase

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,480
services there

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,879
um but yeah that's a brief demo i think

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,480
i didn't really have my chance to show

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,360
you that the app's already built

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,760
yeah being honest yeah yeah and um is

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
this

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,879
this you said this is actually linked to

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,599
the official library this example

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,920
yeah it is um so on github

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,720
and once it loads yeah so in the

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840
packages

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,319
and then cloud firestore file fire store

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
again

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,560
and then the official example that's the

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
exact same code

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,519
just running in my browser that's all

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,239
cool that's good to know because like i

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
think the

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,159
best place to get your hands on this

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
being in the repo is actually a good

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,680
place to have it

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
i'm curious though you had mentioned

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,480
other libraries so like

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,239
what is how is this different from um

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,239
well any other library off the shelf

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
like do you find other plugins to be

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,400
able to

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,360
interact with firebase with

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
um there's a couple of other open source

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,080
ones that kind of try to

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,360
implement the full firebase api in pure

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,400
dart

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,239
yeah and i think the kind of the level

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
of work required there versus kind of

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,040
wrapping an existing official sdk is

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,799
it's a lot more complex and yeah a lot

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,040
more can go wrong

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
yeah and so we kind of just stick to the

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,799
tried and tested

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
sdks that already exist and just provide

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
an interface to them

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,479
okay gotcha so the i guess to clarify

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,000
this is all written in dart um

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,320
yeah java and objective c's a

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
mixture of languages okay and

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
specifically i guess the

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,520
the java comes in for the android uses

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
but yeah exactly yeah

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
an object to see fire escape okay cool

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
yeah and i'm curious of your experience

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,720
what's your experience with

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,040
dart um like have you had a lot of time

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
to play around with it

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah i'm probably need to die probably

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,759
like two years

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,680
um but i've come from other languages a

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,919
lot of them really um but i kind of

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
leaning towards dart is my favorite

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,840
language i guess

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
it's just really it's yeah type safety

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,880
you know safety

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,199
you kind of get all that out the box and

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,000
and yeah i've enjoyed working on it and

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,720
kind of every time

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
there's a project in that space i'm kind

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
of one of the first to jump on it really

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
yeah yeah it's funny because i've known

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
about dart for quite a few years

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,479
um and but i've never actually jumped it

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
or built anything with it and

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,080
perhaps maybe actually outside of the

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
flutter space

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
is dart being leveraged in places like

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
polymer or anything else in the google

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,639
world um i'm not

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,039
not fully sure on it i know there's like

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
um some kind of angular things for that

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,440
and there's also all the whole dart

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
server side things that you can do

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,039
um like cloud functions for firebase you

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,800
can write in dart

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,880
source things you can do it's kind of

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
like the node.js ecosystem where you can

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
do

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
you know back end stuff as well server

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
side things

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,199
yeah yeah yeah because that's that's my

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
reservations like i'm actually really

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,960
interested in flutter

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
um but my reservation has always been if

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
i

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,600
go dig into the ecosystem of dart like

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,039
is that going to transfer over to other

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
things that i can also build

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,560
or is this going to be the one thing i

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,600
do in mobile which i found with things

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
like objective c

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
which i did a bit of ios quite a few

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,560
years ago

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
none of that other than the fact that we

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,560
have typescript like

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
with the types in javascript uh none of

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
that other stuff clearly translated or

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,720
transferred

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,639
um i think

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
i don't know i think if you transfer

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,440
into some kind of other type

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,120
safety kind of equivalent language then

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
i think there's there'll be a lot of

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,080
things that you know will make sense

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
so if you're using typescript for

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,400
example when you come to dart

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
a lot of things would all make sense in

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
terms of how the types work and

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
things like that so i don't say it would

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,720
be

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,960
a waste of learning learning it

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,639
and just how portable to another

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,840
language

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,160
it would be i'm not 100 sure yeah no

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,160
that's that's fair enough too as well um

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,880
but i'm just super excited about the

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
idea of

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
flutter and how it's sort of taken off

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,720
uh i'm also i'm curious

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,400
so i'm gonna switch to my screen real

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
quick because i was thinking about as

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
you were talking

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,599
uh i've used firebase and this is so i

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
mentioned i had an ios app

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,120
um this is from 2016. so it's a

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
oh it's pretty old uh but i was like i

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
wonder how i was

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
because i remember i was using firebase

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
on this and like this heads up i did

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,440
archive this

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
please don't go contributing and do this

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
but

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,479
send all the ps yeah so this was using

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
the firebase um

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,800
like javascript package uh i'm curious

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,599
if like

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
this firebase this this still uh this is

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,400
still around the sdk for

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
for firebase when it comes to like

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,759
node.js and is this when you say yes

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,879
yeah so is this what you're wrapping the

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,000
the flutter fire

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,120
with yeah so

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,440
flutter supports quite a lot of

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
platforms so on web for example yeah we

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
would

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,319
would wrap the js sdk okay whereas on

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,879
android we'd wrap

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,039
the android sdk and ios the ios sdk

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
okay good to know yeah because like what

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
i liked about this and like just going

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,479
through

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
i'm just going to go back to remember

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,000
elaine and remember how i

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
actually you know this was a react

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,840
native app that's why that's why this is

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,680
a javascript uh pakistan json

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
uh but the way i sort of interacted with

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
the honestly this is going to be

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,919
really challenging to how react native

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,919
worked back then

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,320
um this is very early reactive um

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,159
yeah that's yeah uh speaking it's pretty

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,680
rare

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
yeah they um wait yeah because you're

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,080
you're

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
maintaining another project which is the

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
um react native

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,120
version of this yeah that's the react

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,160
native version

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
okay excellent so does that

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,600
how does that translate to your work

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,519
with uh flutter flyer

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,800
there's a ton of similarities i'd say um

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,040
like the

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,399
the way we wrap things and you know

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,560
getting the full in-depth of the

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,640
original sdks

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,080
like a lot of the android and ios code

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,480
to serialize data

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,519
across certain reactions of the bridge

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
and

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
or flutter the method channels it's it's

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
very similar logic

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,399
and very similar in the way you handle

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,160
things

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
so a lot of it does transfer over which

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,920
is kind of why i guess we're working on

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
the flutter fire ones as well because

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
it's

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,680
existing knowledge yeah

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,120
um we did get some uh comments and

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
questions in the chat too as well which

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,440
i i do want to address

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,519
because i i completely missed them um

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
vortex is actually asking about dart

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,480
sass rewrite from dark professionals

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,560
perspective

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,080
um so i'm not sure if you have any

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
context around the dart sass rewrite

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,680
um not 100 sure i and i know that that

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,720
there's a sass implementation in dart

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,560
and

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,240
i heard something about it being

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
rewritten but i'm not

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,720
sure to be honest sorry okay and then i

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
guess the the second half of that is uh

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
any popular things you would have like

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,519
you would like to have in dart are there

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
like missing features

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,079
in the the language ecosystem uh from

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,079
your exposure

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,399
um i would say missing features more

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,240
i think the kind of the package

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,959
ecosystem on the server side of things

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
is

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,399
isn't as great as say the mpm ecosystem

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
yeah i think i would love a really good

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,200
kind of

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
http routing type library for

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
you know dart server side i think there

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,880
was some good ones and then

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,800
some of them now being deprecated and no

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,399
longer maintained

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,240
yeah so yeah that's kind of one of the

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,519
downsides is

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,640
the server-side package ecosystem isn't

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
as great

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,040
at the moment yeah it comes with the um

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
i know in the early days of swift too as

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,079
well because back in 2016 i think it's

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,519
when twist was launched

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,360
um that was one of the concerns is that

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,440
at the moment i think cocoa pods which

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,160
was heavily objective c

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,519
needed to have some sort of something to

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
come after that was swift

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,040
friendly which i don't even know like

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,240
you're in the tooling space i'm going to

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,200
ask you to throw a bunch of questions on

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
you

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
feel free to like defer and be like yeah

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,920
i don't know um but like no carthage

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
uh which was like the swift cocoapods i

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
don't even think it's still around

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,640
anymore

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
um i guess what's your do you have a

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
take on the uh

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,279
tooling space when it comes to native

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,399
development versus using

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
um these sort of hybrid tools like

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,680
flutter

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,079
i'd say i say the hybrid tools are a lot

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
are

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,800
kind of more designed for non-native

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
developers so

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,079
you know a lot more friendlier and

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
doing doing things a newer way versus i

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,399
don't know like a

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,120
c make file and on native code or

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,040
or having a greater build set up on on

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
android it's

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,079
it tends to be a lot cleaner and quicker

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
and easier to

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
get going versus you know native

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,839
environments

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
yeah my findings anyway okay cool and

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,000
then

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
you also mentioned before we even jumped

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
on on the stream that you

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
you don't actually use these tools

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,000
yourself to build apps uh so did you

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,760
want to talk more about like

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,800
the the draw towards building tools

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
versus building apps

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,079
yeah i think yeah the way i'm drawn to

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,959
is

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,040
you know having an impact on other

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,959
developers is is what's kind of key to

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
our

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,279
um company vision is just building tools

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
and

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
helping developers you know build better

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
things with those tools

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
and from from our perspective that's

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
kind of why we focus on the tooling

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
um and it also tends to come with more

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
challenges

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,440
i'd say more more problems to solve that

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,639
haven't already been sold

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,240
versus building an app for example

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
and that's kind of why we focus in that

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
area

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
yeah that makes sense uh vortex is

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
mentioning that uh building tools is

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,200
humanitarian

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,800
and um it's like so

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
i don't know if this is like a good

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
example but everybody brings up those

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
sort of pitchforks and not pitchforks

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
they pick axes during the gold rush

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,240
of building those so that way people can

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,240
you know get gold faster

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
when it comes to things like water like

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
it's it's

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
like dart's been around for a bit

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
flutter has been around for less than a

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
little bit

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
um or less than a bit rather and i think

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,560
there's like a

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,079
and now um developers now looking at it

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
as like an option for them to build

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,959
their mobile apps so

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,880
when it comes to approach it like if i'm

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,160
gonna approach doing flutter and

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,399
i can't even figure out how to get a

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,760
build to run or how to get this compiled

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,519
in an xcode then i'm gonna move away

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,760
from things like that uh but when you

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
have like one of the hardest problems

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
i've actually had to solve which is why

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
i use firebase

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,600
uh is managing data in ios

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,959
um which i always i forget because they

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
don't never use it but um

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,839
what's the data model in ios uh

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,320
xcode it's just been a long time since

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,000
i've done

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,160
anything like that i think uh is it

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,639
called core data maybe it's core data

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,079
whatever it is it was just like the the

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
go-to place so it's kind of like your

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,880
postgres but in ios

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,240
um this was at the time in 2016 this was

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
awful to work with

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,079
um which is why i i personally think

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
firebase did so well

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
uh with multiple mobile developers and

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,680
attraction

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,880
and it's one thing that i've been really

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,639
curious about when it comes to open

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,160
source because if i go into like your

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,600
project and i see oh 365 contributors

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,199
uh like there are a lot of folks that

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,560
probably said in this list are like hey

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,519
i had a fix

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,880
for this one thing yeah but i imagine

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,079
it's probably not the the people in the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,760
top 10 here

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,440
it's probably like in the middle or

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
lower but um

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
yeah i'm curious of like what are some

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,720
things that you do to

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,920
because like you have your team uh that

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,600
works at open source so what are the

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,839
things you do to engage

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,600
contributions and keep people coming

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,680
back yeah

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,440
so from a flutter fire perspective it's

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,600
kind of very early for us

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
maintaining it but i think i can speak

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,160
from like a react nature side of things

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
and working around the firebase it was

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
always just me and elliot for example

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
working on it for quite some time

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,480
and then eventually you know it's kind

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,040
of encouraging people to contribute and

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,920
pointing them in the right direction and

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,279
always being positive on reviews and

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,600
things like that um have helped a lot

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,399
i think one of the the main issues as

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
well sometimes

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,040
uh some maintainers like myself you know

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,240
it's it's hard to let go of something

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,560
yeah it's your little fun project your

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,480
little baby and then

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,160
you don't want someone else to take over

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,959
but i think you need to also kind of let

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,600
go and

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:56,880
encourage other people to to join in and

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,560
i think from experience it that's kind

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,800
of paid off on reality firebase we've

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,320
got some core contributors and now that

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,480
aren't even part of the team and just

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
regularly contribute and

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,519
you know probably more than that we do

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,759
even

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
and that's kind of a good thing really

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,720
yeah

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,240
and you how do you balance that that

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,120
value that you're providing to you like

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,279
do you

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
like send them t-shirts or do they get

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,639
notifications or

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,279
get invited to like you know weekly

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,360
syncs or anything like that

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,199
yeah so some things we do is kind of

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
bring them in on internal conversations

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
on

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,440
you know project direction get them more

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,160
involved with things there

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,279
and sometimes at meetups here we meet up

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,160
with them and then

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,600
in some cases we offered to sponsor them

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,320
for working on it

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
oh yeah awesome that's really cool too

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
as well because um

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
i guess one thing we didn't even cover

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,800
too as well is like what

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
what pays the bills for advertise like

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
you're keeping your staff

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,279
like employed and getting them to still

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
do open source

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,160
yeah so yeah we're a self-funded company

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
and obviously some of it's our money and

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,679
some of it's come comes from maintaining

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,319
these other projects for other clients

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,319
and and also kind of building internal

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,400
tools as well we we tend to do that for

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,640
some other clients as well

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,439
so there's some bits of work like that

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,439
but

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,360
i think everything else we do is open

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,600
source and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
we try to kind of focus on clients that

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
have

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,240
issues in the open source space and work

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,240
on their

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,200
libraries their projects and kind of

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,880
help keep them maintained and up to date

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
and that's kind of i guess where a bulk

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,400
of our funding comes from

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,559
awesome and then uh we kind of brushed

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,120
over the a bit but you had mentioned

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
uh around y'all are generating the sdk

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
or so you're leveraging the existing

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
sdks

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
uh i don't know if you're able to point

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,679
that out in the in the actual code and

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
how that works

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,919
um so like are you yes sure

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,240
specifically hitting like that url

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,160
yeah so pick a platform i guess ios

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,440
android or

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,080
yeah let's go with ios okay yeah okay

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
let's go

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,080
if so you go into packages directory

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
um and then i'm gonna pick cloud

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,320
firestore

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,840
as an example yeah and then the cloud

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
firestore again

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,679
and i can see that and then yeah you see

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,039
there's some inspirations

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,280
yeah lots of packages um and then yeah

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,799
android direction oh sorry ios sorry

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
um and then yeah you've got your

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,559
standard pod spec there

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,559
if you look in there you can see there's

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,080
the ios sdk being

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,120
pulled in somewhere scroll down a bit

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,520
uh um right here

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,559
now that's a ruby script we used to make

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,480
sure all the

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
packages use the same version of the ios

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
sdk

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,480
okay um yes there are israeli mouses

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,000
just above it

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,720
yeah dependency firebase firestore

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
okay yeah those are the official sdks

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
and then

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,200
yeah inside the classes folder we have

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,799
your objective c

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,400
code that wraps that and provides

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,160
a bridging api to toda

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,160
okay yeah and then this is where my

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,200
objective-c knowledge just kind of

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,320
shuts down it's been a been a while

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,320
since i had to do.h

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,320
and m-files dot mess files we call them

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
yeah i mean the the beauty of um and

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
it's funny because um

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
like one thing i did like about xcode

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
and doing objective-c

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,000
is that very little of this code i had

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,640
to actually type manually

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,280
uh a lot of it was sort of intellisensed

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,440
uh for me uh so i did enjoy that and i

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,120
like the fact that like vs code

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
does that pretty well and i think i

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
haven't used dart in vs code together um

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,039
but i imagine with the

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,440
the types it helps to have types

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
yeah it definitely helps yeah there's an

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,520
official um

00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,520
extension for dart and flight on vs code

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,880
okay it definitely helps a lot cool

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,320
all right well i i think this

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
conversation helped a lot too as well i

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,919
think

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,799
i'm i'm sufficiently educated around

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,080
this i think

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,320
if i ended up building something from

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,440
the flutter flow arena and like export

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,799
that in the code which i think that's

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
the whole claim to fame that they have

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,880
there

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,280
uh i'll be able to um

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
yeah i'll be able to leverage

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
butterflyer

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,520
uh in the future if i want to do

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,240
something a little more advanced um so

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,720
i'm looking forward to try that out

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,760
uh any last words or advice you have for

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,880
folks who

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
are interested in open source and

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,840
getting involved

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,520
oh i think you just muted

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,559
yep standard catchphrase of 2021

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,280
um yes just basically just do it

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
it's a very cheesy line but you know if

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
you have a project that you're

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
passionate about and you use it a lot

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,240
and you want to give back then you know

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
have a look at their issues have a look

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
at

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
you know things labeled good first issue

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,320
read their contributing guide and you

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,360
know just kind of

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,360
