00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,200
singapore yes

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
yes that's correct how is it in lovely

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
is it sunny there still

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,599
i think i just feel like singapore is

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,680
always sunny it's always sunny it's like

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,360
a tropical paradise it's basically

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
if you want to come somewhere where it's

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
eternally summer that's basically

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
singapore so

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
yeah i've been here now two years it's

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
pretty cool it's a nice place to

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,560
hang out i actually i originally moved

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,599
to southeast asia for

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
malaysia and then

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,879
malaysia is kind of like singapore on

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
hard mode and singapore is just like

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,239
really easy everything's convenient

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,040
and uh it's it's a cool place dude i

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,280
feel like you're a gamer right

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
not anymore i'm just a startup guy now

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,879
but uh yeah

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
i used to be

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
well you got no time for games

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,360
unfortunately when you when you

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,040
do startups they consume your life i

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,159
think you can still fit it in somewhere

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
there right

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680

top tip for you today now you're here to

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,919
talk about not video gaming even though

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
we

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,199
love video gaming um super bass so

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
obviously repping the brand love the

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
little brand wrap there got it gotta get

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
the brand out there yeah i can see it

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,080
there you go this is the first t-shirt

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
we're trying to print as many

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
as we can to dish them out for

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
hacktoberfest

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
ah right right well we'll get into that

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
well let's um would you like to tell us

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
first of all let's go to what is super

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
bass for those people here who don't

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,840
know exactly what super bass is

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,600
yeah yeah which is probably a lot of

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
people because we're quite new um so

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
super bass is an

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
open source firebase alternative so

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,080
we're basically building the features of

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
firebase but we use open source

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,880
tools and it's a little bit different

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,960
from most open source so we try to

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
use existing open source tools wherever

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,360
we can if they're enterprise grade

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
if we don't think they'll scale so well

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
we can't find anything that will scale

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
as well then we make it ourselves and we

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,000
open saucer on

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
mit or apache 2. so yeah that's what we

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,400
are

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
in a nutshell i've got a few people in

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,639
the chat being like super boys

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
so some people don't know what it is uh

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
it looks really cool

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
um so let's jump over to the website

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,639
really um

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
quickly you can chat me through a little

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,400
bit of this stuff so we've got um

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
obviously he says firebase alternative

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
um you've got it in alpha by looksvi and

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,759
i've been watching

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,960
a few of your youtube videos on the

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,400
alpha releases

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
um so you'd like to talk a little bit

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,319
about the process on how you've got to

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
where you are today like how old is

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
superbase and

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
where are you going next yeah we started

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,360
in january this year

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,759
um so and much super new

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
yeah yeah is is really new the first

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
thing that we built was this real-time

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
engine on top of

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,800
postgres actually we launched that last

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,880
year on uh we open sourced it

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,160
on um on github last year and it was

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,840
um quite popular so we uh then in

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,560
january decided to build the business

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
but

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
we spent a bunch of time talking to

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,319
people talking to developers

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,240
and a lot of them in around january

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
february just decided that um

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
oh that's cool you've got dark mode on

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,759
your oh yeah yeah

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
i can turn it off if we like so no no

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
leave it on i will i will leave it on a

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,280
lot of people asked about it on stream

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
so this is not an official dark mode for

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
github this is um

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,880
it's called dark reader i use it in

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
chrome and i absolutely love it

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,960
um because i've just blinding eyes and

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,000
not fun but yeah

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,400
yeah exactly that's very cool

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
yeah so so in january we talked to a lot

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
of developers and most of them were

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,880
saying yeah i love postgres

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
and then we'd say well what are you

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
using and they'd say well firebase

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,880
and we'd say why because it's just so

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,240
easy so that actually became our first

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,759
task to make postgres

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,440
as easy to use as firebase

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
and then we just started clipping on a

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,160
lot of the functionality that you get

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
out of firebase

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,680
it's not a one-to-one mapping so

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
actually this is a good so this is an

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,800
architecture drawing of of what you get

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,240
out of um i'll start from the bottom up

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
so what you get

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
so you get postgres we give you a full

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
um you basically sign up to our

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,800
platform it's hosted when you sign up

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,039
you start a project we give you a full

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
postgres instance not like a schema or

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,560
anything it's literally a film server

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,039
with postgres level access

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
then you can modify the database and

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
then the first one to point out is

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
postgrest

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
which is an amazing tool if you've never

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,520
heard of it it basically

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
introspects your postgres database and

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
it builds

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
sort of an automatic api kind of like

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,840
graphql but uh restful and it operates

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,919
very low level inside postgres itself

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,479
built with haskell so we actually hired

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,279
uh one of the maintainers of that

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
then the other one is the real time that

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
one we

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,839
built in in-house so that's the one that

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
i mentioned that we

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
built last year in open source and what

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
that is is an elixir server we use

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
phoenix

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,440
and it actually listens to the postgres

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,399
replication stream

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
so we make postgres kind of think that

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,800
it's replicating to another database

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,680
we translate the binary stream the right

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,680
ahead log

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,959
and then we blast it out over websockets

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,880
so you can have many

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,720
sort of connections into the real time

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
server and they can listen to the

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,000
changes in the database

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,640
uh then the other one is the go true

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
instance that is actually built by

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
netlify

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,880
and it's like an authentication server

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,440
which gives sort of third-party logins

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,720
um so we kind of build the functionality

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,920
of firebase auth

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
um using both go true and postgres row

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,200
level security

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,399
so those two combined kind of give the

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,279
firebase auth

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
and then we've got kong and pg api so

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
kong

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,760
stitches everything together it's like

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
an api gateway it's pretty cool it's got

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
all these plugins and things that you

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,959
can add to it

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
and then pgapi we're developing in-house

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,959
so that's

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
basically exposing the functionality of

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,560
postgres over a restful api

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
and there's a bit of a sort of long term

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,480
play when we bring out our api we want

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,160
people to be able to

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,640
over the restful api add columns

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
add tables to their database so you know

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,200
on the fly you can start adding tables

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
and and

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
making changes to your database yeah

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
this is this is really cool we've got

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,000
some people in chat saying yeah nullify

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,959
i have commits and grow truths this is

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
what i love about

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,399
open source and the community is like

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,399
you do stuff like this and then you find

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,399
out that the community is here anyway

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,079
um so it's great so speaking of um

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,440
community feel free to keep chatting

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
amongst yourselves in the chat

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
i'm monitoring the chat all times if

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,920
you'd love to ask any questions

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,839
uh mostly a pulpit even of myself as

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,880
well if you'll have to ask any questions

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,480
i'm a paul about suitcase um

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
drop them in we'll get to as many of

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,240
them as we can i also wanted to come

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,800
commend you commendate you on your read

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,680
me

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,200
i love seeing really good read me files

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
okay i actually

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
yeah i started doing this on stream the

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
other day um

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
about i literally just yesterday saying

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,920
if you have a really good freebie file

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
and really good documentation it makes

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
it really easy

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,320
and you know just you showing us this

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
like the architecture

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
and talking through it and having all

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
the links it's just so like it just

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
looks easy and nice to use

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,279
um and it's one of the things we do when

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
we talk to um

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,959
uh new contributors say for example

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
which we'll definitely get to

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,640
is one of the things to look out for

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,160
when you're contributing to a project is

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,760
do they have a good review file and do

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,800
they have really good documentation

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
because if you're contributing to a

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
project you want to know what you're

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,920
working on

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,959
um so we will get into that but

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,320
it's now been what's january where is

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,519
the year going january february march

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,440
every day june july

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,920
by october it's about eight nine months

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,079
in um to the project so far

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,240
what's the next phase for um super bass

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
yeah so we actually started developing

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
the hosted platform

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,160
around may um so it's been in

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,639
development for around six months now

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,600
and then um we just went through yc

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,600
actually

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
the first remote batch which is pretty

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,639
interesting doing that from singapore

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
then um now so so actually we had this

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,000
really funny

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
uh situation basically when we got into

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,279
yc

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,800
we changed the like on the on the

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
website if you see on the landing page

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,000
it just says back by y combinator

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,560
we did that one day um yeah that one

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,680
there

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,320
and then literally the next day someone

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,959
put us

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,839
on um hacker news and it just went

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,160
actually if you go to the blog

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,839
um blog and then

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,560
the super bass auth yep so we had this

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
launch oh

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,160
basically these are these are all the

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
launches on

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,800
hack and use the dev tool launches on

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,120
hacking is ranked by a vote

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,839
and um so what happened was we got onto

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,519
yc

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
we put the badge on our website and then

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,200
someone a cloudflare engineer

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,320
put us on how can use and it just went

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,480
nuts

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,959
but but the good thing is the good thing

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,120
is everyone in the chat was just

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,639
asking for auth um so we just knew

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,160
exactly what we had to

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,399
build we didn't have any walls at that

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,000
stage so we just spent all of y

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,000
combinator building off

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
um so we're just wrapping up the final

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,160
um you know

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
third-party provider logins um stitching

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
it up

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,440
and then our big push now until december

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
is to move from alpha to beta which is

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
just locking down our apis making them

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
very stable

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
making our hosted platform very stable

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
security performance and

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
stability uh are the three focuses until

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
december

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,160
yeah and what's it like when you launch

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,279
something obviously you're very

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,959
fortunate to

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,720
launch and then just get picked up by

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,720
hacking news and get a lot

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
like feedback from the community how did

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
that shape and change obviously you've

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
figured out that you needed all but how

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,440
does that shape and change

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,240
a product when you can get the community

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
involved on a scale like this

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,920
yeah i think largely when you're

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
starting a project you probably know

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,040
what you want to build

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
and you have a good idea it depends on

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,320
the project of course sometimes you're

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
doing a startup without an idea

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
but in this case we kind of know all the

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,000
features that we might build

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,519
some of them are exactly the same as

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
firebase and some are not

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
but it does push you down this um

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,760
priority path

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
so at that stage we're actually trying

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
to

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
we're about to start building

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,320
integrations so you know

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,480
migrate your database from firebase or

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
migrate in from another service

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,800
but instead we just parked all of that

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,600
and we just as a whole as a team focused

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
on

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
um doing auth so the community

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,160
contribution is largely

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,399
around priorities and we've got this

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,560
awesome thing where we just

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,920
you know on stripe uh if you go into the

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
dashboard they've got this

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
little feedback thing up the top right

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,600
whenever you're in your stripe dashboard

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,199
we just did the same thing where you

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,399
know you can put a feedback

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
you can just write a note and it

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,920
immediately comes into our slack

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,600
and so that that is actually a big

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,440
driver of what we need to develop

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
because people are actually pretty good

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
at putting uh just little bits of

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,920
feedback spotting bugs

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,880
that we need to fix um so that's once

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,639
you go into

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
um base and you log in you'll see it on

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,839
your dashboard exactly

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
obviously i don't have a login i'm sorry

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
yeah that's all right

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,279
no worries so if anyone wants to provide

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,000
feedback um you can help shape

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
the future of simmerbase which is really

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,320
cool

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
now something i want to talk to because

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,000
it comes up on these open source streams

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
it also comes up in my open store

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,160
streams on my channel a fair bit

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,839
which is how does how do you balance the

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
now obviously you're a startup

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,519
and you've gone through y combinator as

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,160
well how do you balance the business

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,399
side of it

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
with the open source side obviously open

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,279
source means that

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
a product is free and open in the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
community community can use it they can

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
also

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,800
contribute to it so how do you balance

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
that out

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,680
yeah it's a good question it kind of

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,079
depends on um

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
so so first of all not all open source

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,639
tools should necessarily be commercial

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,880
open source tools right um but we

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
as a company want to be commercial first

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,720
our goal is to

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,959
actually try support as many open source

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,199
communities as we can

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,720
so so to do that we actually have to

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,079
have a commercial

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,040
focus so the balance largely

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,720
more isn't so much around getting around

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,519
to

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
focusing on business versus community

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,360
it's more around

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,120
stabilizing everything that we can so

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,199
that the community can come in and be a

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,759
driver of the next features so

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,320
extra libraries and things the business

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
um

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,480
in terms of the focus is largely just

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
handled by me

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,680
we've got a kick-ass team of developers

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
and then

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,040
i will try to do all the um

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,240
i will sort of shield them from any of

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,079
the commercial stuff

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,199
um all the fundraising and things like

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,800
that i'll just try and handle myself

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,240
sounds good now i've got the screen up

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
here i did want to do this

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,320
off screen so for those people who are

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,040
you know asking about stuff but um

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,800
i had to log into my account um so here

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,759
we go we've got the the super base here

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
i'm just making sure you can see

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,839
it and if you click this feedback

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,040
feedback on this page so this goes to

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,160
select a look

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,160
yeah we've got a slap channel one yeah

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,799
how's it going we've got it you've

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,360
already got it have you

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,240
yeah we already got it things are quick

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,439
yeah

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,360
now if i wanted to have um you know uh

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
support for supervising my projects what

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,640
types of things would i be using it for

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,959
how many projects can i have at the same

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,280
time running with superface

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,039
yeah so at the moment you can um you

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,480
basically have organizations then

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,440
projects is the hierarchy

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,360
so um yep if you go for example a new

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,480
project it'll ask you to do a

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,880
organization first you can have

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,880
i think it's two organizations and three

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,760
projects within each

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,520
organization that is

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,920
paul nice why is it kiwi by the way

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,039
who's your hand from new zealand

00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,039
[Applause]

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,400
no i mean i should have picked it up

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
being an audition

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,120
yeah exactly well hello from the other

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,240
side of the pond

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,840
yes yeah so um yeah you can have but

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
this is only because it's free at the

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
moment um

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
we'll we'll reduce the restrictions as

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,559
soon as we bring it out but at the

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,039
moment we're paying for everything so

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,520
um because because we're in alpha we

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,240
didn't feel it was fair for anyone to

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,000
pay for anything um so yeah we are

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
hosting all the databases for free so at

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,720
the moment basically you can have sort

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,559
of six projects

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
and you can invite your team members and

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,440
and get started

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,360
so so if people want to support the

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
project in terms of

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,799
um being part of the alpha i mean

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
obviously i just literally logged in

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,720
with my github and

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,280
i can start using it right yep yep sweet

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,559
um what's other ways that people can um

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,559
contribute to the project now i know

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,799
we've got hacktoberfest coming up

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,000
oh yeah yeah we do so would you like to

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,919
talk about that so

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,440
yeah we've got um in fact we've got a

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,120
hacktoberfest board

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,000
um and issue boards yep so if you go to

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,559
no actually to our org level i think

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,480
it's cool let's have a look

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,880
and then projects there should be uh

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
my first board all right i'm making this

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
into the chat for everyone

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,919
now we are still building this out

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,080
because we're still preparing but um

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
yeah we've basically got a bunch of

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,039
different types of tasks so

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,280
maybe small engineering ones

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,799
we put hacktoberfest as a label then

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,640
also the language which you might need

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,280
to develop it in

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,960
larger engineering tasks then we've got

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,640
stuff for designers and we'll plan some

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
stuff for writers as well so it's not

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
just

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,600
developers who can get involved cool so

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
this is actually something i showed

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
yesterday on my stream i didn't realize

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
most people didn't know about github

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,679
project boards

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,640
um so this is this is actually probably

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,640
one of the best

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
ways i've seen project board shoes in

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
terms of like hacktoberfest and getting

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
contributors on boards i really

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,720
i really love this because as i um say

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
if i was i wanted to contribute to

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,760
october first for the first time

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,880
um i've just been learning a little bit

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,280
of vue.js um so i can go all right

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,679
there's a small task here for view

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,600
which is awesome i can also filter these

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,280
by label and i can go

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
ujs and look at all the ones that i've

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,840
got for you just okay there's one

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,200
uh i can look at well labels but maybe

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,400
design

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,840
because i got the designers nice um we

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
got examples

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,240
as well um so these are coolers like so

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
oh there you go for web dev

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
you're like i thought paul's been

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
amazing

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,640
yeah well everyone should should hang it

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
though is a great dude he's just been

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
basically contributing

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
he did all the typescript support for

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,919
our js uh our super base js library

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,760
and then he's just been doing live

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,000
streams we do this quite cool sort of

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,919
instant demo where you can deploy a

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
slack clone a fully functional slack

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,280
clone with real time or

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
everything and it kind of takes two

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,159
minutes it's like a one-click deploy

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,080
with versailles

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
so he's been demonstrating amongst all

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,000
the his live streams so

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
yeah shout out to thor he's been epic

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,679
that's work though

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,520
yes i think this is this is great for

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
being able to continue to october 1st i

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,799
think we will probably end up sharing

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,520
this example a few times

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,280
um as a way to get involved because so

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,799
many times we'll hear people's thoughts

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,200
put the little love heart in the chat

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
um so many times we'll hear um people go

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,919
hey i really want to contribute to

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,520
hacktober first

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,600
um i really want to be involved in open

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,159
source but you know i have no idea where

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,480
to start

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
or there's just so much going on like

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
what do i do and i think

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,840
laying it out like in this protocol that

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,400
you've got is just so so simple for

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,240
people

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,919
now you did mention that you've printed

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,840
a bunch of super base

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
t-shirts so what are you doing on that

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,559
front well we haven't

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,360
but but that's our goal basically

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,039
we'd love to get to a point where um

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,960
we're doing it now to see if we can

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,080
distribute it around the world it's uh

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,919
not so easy logistically but yeah um we

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,360
would hope that um we get them done

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,039
before hector fest and people

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,520
contributing can

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,280
can um yeah get a t-shirt as well get

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
some swag we'll we'll have something

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,360
some way of rewarding the people who

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,240
contribute but i i will say as well

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,480
um you know people asking you know how

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,039
do i contribute to hecktoberfest

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,280
i i think like it's it's it's quite

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,000
difficult for maintainers to think up

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,640
small tasks chunk off and and design a

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
task

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
which might be very approachable if

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
you're thinking of

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
contributing i would come in and even

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,720
ask ask a question propose

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,159
something so we had for example our

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,080
first intern who came in

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
proposed that he could just do one small

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,039
thing with russ make one of the

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,480
libraries with rust and

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,039
you know we don't want to set up the

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,559
task and and show how you would do it

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,320
we just say yeah cool if you want to go

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,240
off and do it he actually now is

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,080
is one of our employees because there's

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,400
kick ass but if you're thinking about

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
contributing just poke around um

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
come up with something if you're a

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
non-techie there are plenty of things

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,440
you can do design work

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,640
you can contribute to the code to the

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,559
documentation

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,720
you can write a blog post all sorts of

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
things and this is what i love about

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
open source most people just

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,720
think that you know open source and

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,919
programming is all about the programmers

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
and it's all about the people who build

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,480
this stuff and

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
as you just mentioned and you've got

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,919
columns here for it too

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
there's so much work for other people to

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
do as well um

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,159
i think one of the things a lot of

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,799
people forget about especially when

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
they're

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,679
um developing apps is like the need for

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,039
documentation and writers is just so

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,960
so massive right and people

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,200
they want people to understand the code

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,240
as well um and who can then go and write

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,520
something about it um

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,960
improve it for other people you know i

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,240
mentioned you had a such a really great

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,880
readme file

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
um so there's so many ways to get

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,799
involved if you're not

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,240
um or even if you are just starting

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,720
programming you don't feel

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
confident um necessarily and just

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,440
contributing to the code there's so many

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,440
other things you can do like i like this

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,679
one here like improve our logo

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,919
just get on and help improve our logo or

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,080
create a component library or

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,279
you know i mean you haven't built out

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,960
the documentation part yeah

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,799
i'm assuming like you know right some

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,120
documentation so

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,320
exactly exactly the other thing because

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,159
superbase is

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,679
you know quite generic another great way

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,320
to contribute for us is literally just

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,039
to build

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,039
something with it um we've got we just

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
got github discussions which i'm pretty

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,400
excited about

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,760
it's a bit uh empty i think it's under

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,159
the super base super base

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:33,600
um repo okay the pin

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,039
yeah and then discussions

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,840
yay so we just got it this week and

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,760
started so

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
pretty yeah you guys have done a lot of

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,919
work on this i really like it

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,000
okay oh well thank you yeah it's still

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
new so we've got a lot more to go but

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,840
yeah there's a show-and-tell section

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
we've got one uh these guys surf the

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,159
world

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,159
uh just built this awesome chrome

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
extension where you know you can chat to

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
people

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
as you're visiting websites you can just

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
chat to people

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,480
as you're surfing around is built with

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,000
super base so these are an other

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,880
another way you can just build something

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,679
and then um put it on the show-and-tell

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,960
and that helps us because um you know

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,600
you'll come across bugs

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,039
you can tell us about them um and you

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
can come up with some ideas of what we

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,360
can build next

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,440
this is so cool i really i love all the

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,000
use of all the emojis

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,679
yeah yeah b doggies like my discussions

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
don't even look that good and i work at

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,080
github

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
how cool does this look i'm just like it

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,960
looks so nice there's a show-and-tell

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,960
here

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
um so you've got obviously that's that's

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
all of them there

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,000
you've done a really really good job i

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
really like the layout it looks so nice

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,279
it's easy

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,440
to was like again as i was first time

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,600
contributor i'd be looking at this going

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,200
wow this this doesn't just look easy to

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
get involved in and well organized it

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,320
also looks fun

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,320
right and that's kind of what you want

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,320
when you're trying to like attract

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
people to it you like like how do you

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,679
break out from the noise right

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:03,440
yeah exactly and and this one so

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,520
we'll actually center everything around

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,880
our github a lot of people come in and

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,120
say oh you know do you

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,039
have a community slack but actually

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
we'll use this as our forum so

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,799
if you're wanting to get involved in any

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,799
way you can even just start

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,320
asking questions on there and we'll

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,200
answer them and it's a good way just to

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,120
slowly get

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,039
uh get yourself embedded in the

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,520
community and then you know you can grow

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,559
into

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,600
maybe contributing as well yeah nice now

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,480
for web dev i have on time too but um

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,000
our bot timer gets rid of url so if

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,480
you'd like a url

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,840
um we'll post them all here either

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
myself or b-doggy

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,799
i will post any urls here but um i'll

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,520
try and keep on burning you though

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,120
yeah but yeah this looks so pretty i

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
love it it looks great um

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,320
i think uh bw we definitely need to get

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,880
some um

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,200
take some ideas from this it just looks

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,000
it looks so nice and so

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,480
shout out to github i think they set up

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,799
most

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
categories and things so and even just

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,120
the concept of discussions

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,279
it automatically cleans up our issues as

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,760
well we move sort of long-standing

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,440
q and a's we've got this one where you

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
can vote for libraries

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,159
which is actually quite interesting

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
seeing what everyone's voting for like

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,039
different client libraries

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
and that one's kind of like a long

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,120
standing it'll it'll

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,320
so this is databases but if you go back

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,480
the libraries one

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,679
is um client libraries

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,520
right libraries okay yeah so it's

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,399
super interesting what people are voting

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,080
for you know tyson

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,159
and this was an issue but of course it's

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,880
not supposed to be an uh a github issue

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,200
it's just where

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,279
people can come in and say i i love dart

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,559
for example is one of the most popular

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,440
uh upvoted and so um it's great for a

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,320
discussion

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,679
uh much better than a issue template and

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,200
this is one of the main reasons why we

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,240
brought in discussions right is because

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,159
we noticed that

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,320
there was all these discussions going on

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
in issues it's like that shouldn't be an

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,600
issue like an issue was originally

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
designed

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,360
for you to like call out issues within

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,360
your code

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,799
so um and this is what i love about it

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
and you probably i'm not sure if you

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,720
know

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,360
yet but um with the discussions and

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,679
issues if

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,200
there's an issue and it's open and it

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,640
starts turning into a discussion you can

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,159
convert it to a discussion

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,279
and vice versa if you're having a

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,720
discussion about something you're like

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,320
oh this should be a feature

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,600
then you can then convert that into an

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
issue so you can go and create that

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
straight away

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,760
so yeah that's very cool i mean i'm not

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,679
on discussions

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,679
team so i i like talking about how

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,720
amazing our discussions take

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,640
um but they've done a brilliant job um

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,080
on this and yeah this is a really good

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,799
showcase of it so

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,320
well done i agree i like it now

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,799
something i did want to ask about is

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,559
under

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,399
a lot of your issues do you have good

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,480
first issues set up

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,320
um probably all of them are just tagged

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,360
as hecktoberfest at the moment okay

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,039
yep um so we do yeah we will

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,480
get much better at this but we're

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,799
basically tagging

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
um you know hecktoberfest for anything

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,399
where you can get

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,159
involved and on the board it'll be um

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,360
sort of the smaller tasks that good

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,919
first issues

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,799
uh we also put a language so some you

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,080
know

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,080
gotcha is written in go um our real-time

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,840
server is written in elixir

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,279
a lot of our client libraries are

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,279
written in javascript so

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,120
we'll just start tagging we already have

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:27,039
started tagging the language so

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,399
if you want to contribute to a specific

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,760
language or you're a specialist in a

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,760
specific language then

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,120
you'll be able to filter by um by that

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
as well so

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,480
that's what we can do is label uh let's

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,480
try

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,120
go uh yeah oh now

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,120
oh yeah so that's the other thing our

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,399
repos are very sprawling

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,200
okay yeah because we've basically got so

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,080
many different

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,880
um uh bits of architecture you know each

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
one of those

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,600
um each one of the

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,120
bits that we talked about at the start

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,480
postgres go through

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,360
um yeah we've got client libraries for

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,840
each one of them

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,679
and we put them into their own

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,159
repository and they're all automated so

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,240
the

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,440
documentation the testing all using

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,720
github actions

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,399
so to to do that um we split it out we

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,039
originally had a model repo

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,799
but we decided we'd split it out into

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,960
many sprawling repos

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,200
and then uh yeah so you'll have to dig

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
around but the easiest way is to use the

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,919
project board

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,679
and find issues you can just pop out

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
jump out to the repo from there

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,799
sounds good now i've got a couple

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,520
questions in the um chat

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,799
um you've said that super bass is coded

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,880
in a number of different languages and

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,880
we had saw a couple people upload a dart

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
so someone's asking is there any um dark

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,600
coding in super bass at all

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,399
any dart crud did you see any dark

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
coding

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,480
dart language yeah so we just had the

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,240
first

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,840
basically what we've got is a superbase

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,080
js library

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,120
which is made up of three different sub

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,399
libraries so

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,240
you can see we're doing it in a very

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,440
open source way but um the

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,919
sub libraries are go true js

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,640
and then we've got postgres js and then

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,039
we've got

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,640
real-time js and each one of these you

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,000
can use a standalone for the other

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,720
servers so one of the ways that we

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,120
support

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,080
um the other communities we and all of

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,919
these get rolled up

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,279
into one master library called super

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,600
bass js

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,279
we just had the first contributor

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,559
contribution for dart which is the

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,760
postgrest

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,519
dart library um the other day and uh

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,840
actually as by one of our team members

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,120
we have dog fooding friday where you can

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,880
just work on anything

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,760
and they decided yeah

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,039
dog food or dog fooding you know you

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
build something that you're gonna use

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,720
yourself

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,960
um so so we dog food everything inside

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,399
we use super bass to build super bass

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,480
and then on fridays you can build

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,039
projects on top of super bass so you

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
learn

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,320
you know what what to improve next so we

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,000
call it dog food on friday

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
i gotta be honest most the time people

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,880
are just um working on

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,960
you know the tasks work

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,080
but but they're allowed to work on

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,000
whatever so yeah

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,720
last friday one of the team members

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,519
spent dog food and friday doing um

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,360
a dart library for postgrest which is

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,120
pretty cool and you can just follow our

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,039
spec for postgres.js

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,360
and then you just copy it into the other

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,360
library uh the other language

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,720
and that's what i like about um github

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,919
as well so obviously if you go to any

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,240
repository

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,679
it'll show you the languages that are

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,399
used now obviously when you look at

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,120
javascript it's 72.6

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,960
but javascript has a lot of um sub

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,440
libraries underneath it so obviously

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,399
yeah you view react uh all those kind of

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,840
so

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,000
that's the annoying thing about that is

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,080
you can't see i don't think you can

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,519
break down into the percentage the

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,519
reason is because

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,039
this one is actually just our sort of

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,240
website and docs

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,320
this repo okay right um and then

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,519
you've got to go off to find the other

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,559
you're going to explore a little bit

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,720
around our

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,120
repositories so yeah the real-time one

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,960
is full elixir

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,320
and obviously a little bit of you know

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,000
there's your front end there

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,240
yeah we've got an example some make

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,919
files and um some posts

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,840
we use a lot of docker compose to make

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,880
sure that everything's easy to stitch

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,000
together

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,240
um yeah so we've got individual uh

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
repos for each one we've got a fork of

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,480
go through

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
we're just doing some improvements uh to

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,200
push back

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,559
and then postgres as well as another

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,200
great one so

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,640
if you have never used postgres before

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,039
and you're wondering oh how do i

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,240
get started we were actually the first i

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,200
was really surprised but

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,000
um in march this year no one had put

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,159
postgres

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,679
into the digital ocean marketplace

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,320
there's a one-click deploy

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,080
so we actually started by uh pushing

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,600
that in and it's got all the extensions

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,000
that you need so you can

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,120
you know use postgis you can use

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,200
yeah you can code in plva pl python

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,519
um yeah we just add a bunch of really

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,159
useful extensions pgtap for

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,840
unit testing postgres but yeah if you

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
want to get started with postgres i'd

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,480
say our repo

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,520
is probably one of the easiest you can

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,440
just um get started using a docker

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,440
file and and you're up and running in

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,800
just a couple of seconds

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,919
it's pretty good i mean that's one of

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,520
the the blockers right it's not just

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,040
where do i start but then once i've

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
figured out where to start is then how

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
do i

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,399
start um and i suppose for a lot of

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
devs new contributors if you can't get

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,200
over that initial roadblock of

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,240
um basically what you want is one click

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,599
and then you've got the environment

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,919
ready to go right

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,960
um so once you can get over that it's

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,839
really good so it's great that you've

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,079
got it on

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,119
the digital ocean marketplace one click

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,040
was it

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,240
yep one click deploy for the postgres

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,440
database that's

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,720
really really cool um all right so with

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,560
october first coming i just want to go

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,079
back a little bit because it is

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,280
in like on on my side and on your side

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,040
it's like five days

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,720
for everyone in america it's like six

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,359
days we're just like where the cool kids

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,760
live in the future right

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,200
so it was only five days away and we're

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,079
all really excited for it

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,240
um what are your kind of like

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:10,560
expectations

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,079
for oktoberfest being that this is the

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,119
first time you'll be doing it as

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
super bass yeah well and actually it's

00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,400
the first time i've done it

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,720
ever so i don't really know what to

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,119
expect i have to be honest um

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
i just think what would be awesome is if

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,320
people were jumping in

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,920
just commenting just getting involved

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,760
really i think you know

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,119
for every person who's a core

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,400
contributor there's

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,240
like a lot of people just on the

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,880
periphery kind of watching

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,320
um it'd be nice if those even just the

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,359
watchers the lurkers in

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,160
in reddit terms become you know sort of

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,000
they might just

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,200
comment or add an emoji to the

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,440
discussions or

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,400
do anything um to get involved i think

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,880
that'd be nice

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,520
just ease their way into it i think you

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
know the

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,800
in terms of being a contributor if you

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,920
want to move from

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,680
um from being

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,200
like a lurk uh you know you might have

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,720
contributed a little bit to getting

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,599
involved in super bass we'll make that

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,119
super easy

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,040
but it'll be harder for the people who

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,960
just have never done anything

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,720
and it's up to them just to um yeah get

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,520
involved and find some small

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,280
way to contribute because our issues

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,920
probably will be a bit big for

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,920
for a lot of people and actually they're

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,839
going fast like i just put one up

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,960
this morning and someone already said

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,800
they want to solve it

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,800
i think it was 10 minutes later um

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,640
so we'll probably run out of things on

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,320
on the board um so i think it's just up

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,839
to people to come up with

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,760
ideas of how to get involved with the

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,079
community and we're super open

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,079
we're very friendly um would love for

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,640
anyone to come in even if you're brand

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
new

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,720
you've never done postgres don't worry

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,240
about it we'll help you through it

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,680
you've never done javascript we'll help

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,320
you through that you want to do docs

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
we'll

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,599
help you get involved with that as well

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
actually i've got a question for you on

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,400
that one

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,359
yeah sure i was think i saw just

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
yesterday get

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:02,160
github brought the code spaces yeah

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,119
yeah and would that be a good way for

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,280
people to

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
uh what i'm thinking is you know if they

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
spot a problem

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,079
with our documentation could they spin

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,560
it up

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,720
and make edits to our documentation

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,560
directly using code spaces or is it that

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,640
not a good use case

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,480
i'm going to throw that one to be dougie

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,280
on that but for those of you who don't

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,160
know about

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,480
um code spaces basically what code space

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,320
is allowed and this is why i'm asking bw

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,920
um about whether documentation would be

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
the best thing to do in code spaces or

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
whether it's better doing something else

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:35,280
basically what codespaces does is it

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,839
spins up an entire virtual environment

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,520
for you to start contributing um and

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,920
making changes to a project

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,560
immediately um so what i'll do it'll um

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,160
it'll find

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,640
the it'll spin up this virtual machine

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,839
for you and then

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,400
once you've got that it'll install every

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,960
dependency

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,160
every action will get um like initialize

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
all that everything you need

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,480
to get started will just happen on there

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,720
so if i spin up mining code spaces

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
um i don't have a write access to the

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,760
repository

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
and also i have a limit of two but

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,359
basically um the last time i did it it

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,040
took about

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,200
a whole maybe 10 to 20 seconds

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,720
just get up in a virtual environment and

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,839
be able to do this so the question be

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,000
doggie was

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,599
with code spaces coming out and coming

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,560
out in beta and

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,200
more available and there is also def um

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,079
feature

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,640
a dev container feature um paul's

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,599
question

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,760
was is is spinning up a code space

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,560
environment useful for contributing to

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,520
back to documentation i mean my initial

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,599
thought would be

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,280
it's better for contributing back to

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,960
code and documentation

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,200
is often better on other platforms

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
because you don't need to have all the

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,400
um dependencies in store to be able to

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
do documentation but i'm gonna throw

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,640
that on the video he's

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
he's been working a lot more on code

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,800
spaces than i have um okay

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,920
but we absolutely love code space i know

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,599
a lot of people here

00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,240
are loving it too um so code spaces if

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
you've got access to code spaces beta um

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,680
is a great opportunity to try it out

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,280
during um

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,880
oktoberfest and vdoggy is on the same

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,400
five length and just like depends on how

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,400
complicated the docs are

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
yeah okay we actually use yeah

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
docusaurus it's just markdown docs but

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,160
yeah i think it'd be a great way even to

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,760
get people

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,000
you know we've got docker compose files

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
because our stack is like uh

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,560
usually a database then some middleware

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,400
um and then maybe an example on top it'd

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,000
be a great way for people to spin up our

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
examples and and get

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,680
running directly from the github would

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,200
be pretty cool but

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,040
we'll see we'll we'll play around with

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,200
them and hopefully we'll maybe we'll

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
have something for hectobfs if it

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,079
is a good use case um but otherwise yeah

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,560
uh for hacktoberfest i have

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,520
no uh expectations i'd just love for the

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,839
community to

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,079
get involved and and we'll try support

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,839
uh support the community to get involved

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,599
uh however we can

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,040
yeah oh there's a lot of people having

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,079
an environment it's pretty boring

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,320
you can definitely you can pretty much

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,160
do anything like from it right

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,760
i mean fork the node and have the test

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
suite up and running like straight away

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,319
which is what i love about it

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,000
now i know some of you are really

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,800
excited for code spaces so

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,560
um keep an eye out it's coming soon um

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,920
and it's gonna be really good now there

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,760
was something you mentioned

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,359
oh actually that's what i really want to

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,680
rift on a little bit is

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,040
um you know we often talk about one of

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,520
the reasons for getting involved in open

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,200
source

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,280
is knowing you're contributing back to

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,119
the community but you're learning a lot

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
and you're hearing from a maintainer

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,480
like paul here who's saying

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,000
we're here to help you if you want to

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,200
learn some javascript we'll help you if

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,960
you want to learn you know i've done

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
postcards before we'll help you

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,160
and i love the fact that you are saying

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,960
that because we often say to people you

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
know

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,920
come to a hackathon because you'll learn

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,200
stuff you can learn from other people or

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
you know contribute to open source

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,319
because you'll learn stuff and they're

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,920
like

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,079
will i really learn something i know

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,079
it's like yes the maintainers are here

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,839
they're telling you that will teach you

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,599
so i i just want to thank you for that

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,640
um which is really cool so

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,440
yes um i think especially for us

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,000
the our unique sort of value prop is if

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
you've ever

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,800
wanted to use postgres um which is just

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,280
a kick-ass tool um

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,720
honestly in terms of um open source

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079
tools it's got to be one of the best in

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,240
the world they

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,319
release faster than any sort of closed

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,079
source they just released pg-13

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,160
um last night um i think only uh

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,480
three months after releasing off maybe

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,920
six months after releasing pg12

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,000
but uh if you ever wanted to get

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,000
involved with postgres we make it

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,079
super easy to get involved with uh

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,720
postgres and to start using it

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,000
and you know you can just sort of start

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,839
on on easy mode

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,680
and then basically when you sign up for

00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,440
our dashboard we've got this sort of

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,800
it kind of looks like airtable you can

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,119
get involved setting up

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,960
tables you can filter and everything and

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,359
then as you go down the icons on the

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,319
side

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,400
um you basically get to yeah the full

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
postgres database where you can query it

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,839
and

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,480
you can edit it so um you can start

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,520
just dabbling into postgres and honestly

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,520
it's one of these

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,960
tools which i think will never go away

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,839
it's it's it's just

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,319
uh you know if you get to enterprise

00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,960
grade

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,800
it's still a very valuable tool so

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,720
everything from startups to enterprise

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,680
using postgres worth learning and we're

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,400
here to help you learn that

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,240
sounds great now i've just um got up so

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,920
as b-doggy mentioned if you ever want to

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,800
see anything we've got our github public

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,440
roadmap

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,319
um so we just launched this not that

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
long ago

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,280
um literally a few weeks ago maybe even

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,480
just a little 15 days or something like

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,720
that was updated

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,560
um but basically we now have a public

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,480
roadmap for all our releases

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,160
um and what all i did was i just

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,520
filtered and just typed in

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,359
code spaces to see when the public

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,800
availability for code spaces will be

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,720
and it's set for q4 so any time between

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
october 1st and the end of the year

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,119
basically but if you're keen on looking

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,960
at code spaces you can jump into

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,079
um the issue here so you can click that

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
and it will just give you like a little

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,760
bit of a summary of

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,359
code spaces how is it going to work and

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
then you can see here that it is on the

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,119
um

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,000
q4 um for 2020. so um it's coming soon

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,240
keep an eye out

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,839
i don't have a set date for you but it's

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,560
it's gonna be exciting um

00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,920
to have it available to all of you um

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,079
now paul

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,760
i want to backtrack just a little bit uh

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,520
we've talked we've talked a lot about

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,640
supervised and talked about how surveys

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,040
came about it's it's nude it's exciting

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,760
um you know we've got hector fest coming

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
up let's people

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,720
hopefully going to contribute to your

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,240
project now after seeing this and how

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,319
pretty the discussions in the roadmap

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,319
look are they um read me sorry looks

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,480
um but let's talk a little bit about you

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,720
so how did you get into programming you

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,880
know

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
talk about how survey started but how

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,200
did you get into programming originally

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,280
you're

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,800
from new zealand that's not exactly the

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,640
easiest place to get started

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,079
so that's true they don't even know what

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,760
a startup is in new zealand

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,599
honestly when i go back they're getting

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,079
better they're getting better

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,720
yeah i got to say been a while since i

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,839
was back

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,800
working but yeah originally actually

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,640
i think i started way back on like

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,920
dreamweaver days where you'd sort of use

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,480
a wysiwyg to

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,640
um code things and you'd code everything

00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,440
via ftp you'd literally be updating it

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,359
on the

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,800
on the server so i've been doing tech

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,560
for 15 years now

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,880
i started i think around 18. um

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,000
and then like one day someone said oh

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,359
can you build a

00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,160
um build sort of a dashboard

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,599
for it was actually this is not

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,040
surprising for new zealand there's like

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,760
an ag tech it's sort of

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,319
working in agriculture what they wanted

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,440
was a

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,800
a live update live updating funny it's

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,079
real time i didn't really think about

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,599
this but they wanted a real-time

00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,480
dashboard of um

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,440
you know some events happening it was

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,119
actually working in

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,040
abattoirs that they wanted sort of like

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,800
a live updating dashboard for their

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,760
farmers to log in and see

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,640
pricing and things like that this is

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
bizarre to say

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,240
but it was built in cold fusion i'd be

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,400
surprised if anyone

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,480
even knows it it's like this adobe

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,760
server-side language but it built very

00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,760
nicely with flash

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,040
graphs and things like that so that's

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,839
how i started and i

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,040
ended up sort of just contracting all

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,319
throughout my uni

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,680
um i started just working and then by my

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,079
final year i was

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,800
pretty much just working full time and

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,000
uni was

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,480
kind of a sidekick and from there i just

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,960
carried on i went into

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,800
programming for hedge fund for a while

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,359
unfortunately i did a stint um

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,160
with uh consulting and doing project

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,160
delivery

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
in australia actually uh with accenture

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,040
in sydney not melbourne but uh yeah that

00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,160
was cool uh worth doing because it

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,720
it helps you learn sort of uh

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,680
corporate and and the reasons why you'd

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,079
probably never

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,800
enjoy that life so i i moved out of

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,040
there and i

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,800
got into startups and yeah i started um

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,160
this is now my third third startup

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,319
what's gonna be my next question how

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,240
many stops you've been on now

00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:57,520
yeah how'd the other two go are they

00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,520
still going

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,800
yeah yeah they they are actually so the

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,839
first startup was

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,240
um i i was in uh

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,680
sydney and i had a contract for the

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,839
australian government

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,599
and they said to me ah you know because

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,040
you're you've got the job but

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,800
i went in and they said oh because

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,440
you're a kiwi we have to give you

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,880
approval

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,640
that you can work in this government job

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,359
and that an australian can't do it

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,960
and in that week i had this guy text me

00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,000
and he sent me a photo

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,560
of uh this poem he was living in kuala

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
lumpur

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,640
and he had this condo that he was living

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,119
in and it had like a pool on the on the

00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,880
roof

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,200
with palm trees and he's like wouldn't

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,800
you rather build a startup with me

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,480
than work for the australian government

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,119
so i literally just

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,400
jumped on a plane the next day and flew

00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,880
to malaysia and that was

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,580
yeah i probably visited that pool maybe

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,680
twice

00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,280
[Laughter]

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,960
so you took the job for the pool and

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,079
only went there twice in the

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,720
five six years yeah yeah well startups

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,680
are

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,079
all consuming right they just um tell me

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,920
about

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,920
it i think i'm on my like fifth or sixth

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,480
now i'm kind of lipstick outfit yeah

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,839
yeah

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,680
um and yeah they they i don't know if

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,119
they get easier well not not in terms of

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,000
the amount of work definitely it's

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
always just

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,119
a million tasks that you need to do you

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,520
just kind of come to expect

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,119
the grind i think that they get easier

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,200
in terms of knowing where to cut corners

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,160
and knowing who to go to and what to do

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,680
i think um you know we're after that was

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
one of the reasons when we got to my

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,440
current startup we are now it's like

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,599
cool we've done this a few times before

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,440
now we know exactly who to go for what

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,480
um you know this this and this and we

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,559
know we've got all that you've got all

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,200
the contacts as well and the connections

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,920
i think that's a um a massive thing not

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,440
just in

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,599
you know the startup world having those

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,800
connections and networks but also in

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,240
um as a developer um and working in tech

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,680
i mean that's one of the things i

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,520
encourage people to work on open source

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,559
is because you meet other really cool

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,800
people and you know

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,800
if you didn't know this your mate who

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,000
had this fancy condo you'd probably be

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,000
still stuck working for the charlie

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,680
goblet right

00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,079
exactly it was actually quite hard to

00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,720
sort of break into startups especially

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,640
new zealand australia i knew i wanted to

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,920
sort of work in startups and not just do

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,040
corporate tech

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,640
it was quite hard definitely if i was to

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,119
start over and i was thinking how to do

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,599
it

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,800
i would just become a contributor to an

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,960
open source tool

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,880
um and get involved that way or if you

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,359
are thinking about getting uh started

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,079
even to start your own setup i'd highly

00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,280
recommend

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,079
um just joining one for like approaching

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,920
any

00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,839
startup and saying hey i'll intern for

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,880
you for free for three months or do

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,280
whatever you can

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,319
to work in there and you'll learn so

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,400
much just from

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,319
um you know absorbing in three months

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,760
you'll learn all the lessons that you

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,400
as a founder would have to learn

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,160
yourself exactly

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,839
it costs the same amount of money but

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,200
it's actually it costs less because as a

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,760
founder you're the one spending all the

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,640
money

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,359
yeah yeah usually usually they'll pay

00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,040
you but

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,040
what is your what is your startup at the

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,559
moment um so i'm gonna electric scooter

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,200
electric scooters

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,400
like like kickstand type ones that you

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,480

a few weeks actually which is really

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,440
cool um we did a kickstarter

um in november last year so okay

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,720
very cool so yeah that's that's the

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,520
current one anyways

then our factories over in

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,520
china so that's been fun working

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,960
remotely which is actually going to be

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,319
the next question i was going to ask and

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,880
we've got a couple questions in the chat

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,200
is

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,400
is your whole team for super bass based

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,520
remotely distributed or remotely so

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,599
most of them are here but um we never

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,760
see each other

00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,760
we're fully remote no and you can you

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,960
can hang out here in singapore now but

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,960
dang i'll come to singapore then yeah

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,880
you should it's awesome tropical i have

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,319
been there twice i actually really like

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,280
sinful so next time i'm coming we'll

00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,839
catch up

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,880
yeah definitely but uh but yeah we're

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,040
fully remote so

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,280
um we've got uh yeah i mentioned the

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,839
maintainer of postgrest uh he's based in

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,640
peru

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,680
um we've got a guy in new zealand uh a

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,079
guy in london

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,359
um yeah well most of us here in

00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,920
singapore but we don't care

00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,440
where you live in fact we uh sort of

00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,040
encourage that you have this mindset

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,559
that if you join us you can

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,720
live anywhere and you might want to live

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,079
anywhere we we kind of we're still

00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,680
figuring out sort of our

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,440
wage model but we think that what we'll

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,960
do is just you know it's a new world

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,640
we'll play flat

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,400
flat uh salaries um well based on levels

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,920
and then if you want to live anywhere

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,000
you want to live in bali and

00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,440
reap the benefits of wage arbitrage then

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,599
go for it

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,200
and if you want to move that's fine we

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,800
don't care where you will move we'll try

00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,880
to help support that

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,960
that's pretty cool and i i kind of

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,400
hinted that you all remote

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,559
because you're asking what video game to

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,160
play with everyone remotely so um

00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,640
the other really good one how big is

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:12,000
your team at the moment actually yeah

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,880
eight by head count a couple of them are

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,319
actually interns they are singapore

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,839
interns they came in

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,160
actually one of them or two of them are

00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,920
my interns from previous companies who

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,319
are studying and then when we got into

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,040
yc we just had like a hundred days for

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,280
demo day

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,079
and it happened to coincide with their

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,480
um break

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,359
for uni so they just worked their hours

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,680
off um

00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,640
through through the 100 days to hit our

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,319
demo day

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,839
and they're back at uni for their final

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,000
year but um

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,920
but um they're still kind of working

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,680
part-time so that when they

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,119
come out of uni they can hit the ground

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,880
running full-time but

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,880
yeah we'll be looking we'll be looking

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,920
to double the team

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,079

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,319
got eight people on your team right you

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,520
know that's the perfect number to play

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,839
mario kart or super smash bros

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,640

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,559

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,960
maximum and mario kart you can play up

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,599
to 12 online so

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,720
okay go check it out um there's also a

00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,800
really really cool

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,960
um so we've got a bank here in melbourne

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,559
called up banking which is a very

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,839
like edgy kind of starter and they built

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,200
an open source tool which you can

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,640
actually find on github

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,480
um for tracking your mario kart stats

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,319
so over the course of the race it'll

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,599
give you a graph of like who's been in

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,079
first at what time when

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,640
items hit and dropped um yeah it's

00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,760
pretty fun

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,280
we've got a couple people in the chat

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
saying yeah up banking is definitely the

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,839
bomb so um

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,319
that's a good one to do because you can

00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,920
create some really fun um

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,200
i mean it's obviously all using code as

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,480
well as me like all right tell us what's

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,000
happening with the code here

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,760
or you can just actually just go play

00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,520
mario kart because it's fine um now i

00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,720
have a couple other questions so

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,720
um obviously you went to uni in

00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,319
new zealand i'm going to say i did yeah

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,680
i know i know the person who's asked

00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,319
is from new zealand asking what

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,040
university you went to in new zealand

00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,520
i went to the university of canterbury

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,760
um

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,800
so i i went to school in christchurch

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,960
and then i studied

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,920
um actually there wasn't really a full

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,920
it degree

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,280
it was like a bachelor of commerce and

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,280
sort of finance

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,400
accounting and information systems so

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,839
that's what i study

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,680
well i mean that's all perfect for being

00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,359
a startup now because you're a bit of

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,960
everything right yeah and you did

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,200
mention that while you're going through

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,839
uni you actually did quite a lot of

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,359
um like internships or other jobs on the

00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,400
side right and you ended up just doing

00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,520
uni like

00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,680
part time as a side gig what are some of

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,119
your recommendations oh you say

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,280
cool it's in quake city nice crazy yeah

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,960
um so what are some of your

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,640
recommendations for people

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,640
who are going through uni you said you

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,440
know go get an internship

00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,079
um for three months do you reckon people

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,760
um

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,359
are able to do that during university

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,240
what kind of tips do you have for

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,559
university people who are maybe studying

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,559
um

00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,920
engineering or it and want to get into

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,280
either developer or

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,040
startups yeah i mean hard to generalize

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,720
this depending on your location if you

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,359
want to get a physical

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,040
job somewhere so if you're a developer

00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,799
i'd say the world's your oyster right

00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,960
you can literally

00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:43,280
you know start contributing to an open

00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,520
source tool anywhere you can actually

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,640
reach out to startups around the world

00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,119
and now

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,680
everyone's open to up i mean even vcs

00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,119
are coming

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:56,160
to the idea of a remote first world so

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,720
it's probably even easier if you are of

00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,200
um if you're a developer and even so if

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,680
you're just

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,520
you know not a developer you're you want

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,200
to contribute startups are always they

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,640
will always take people on

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,280
um so so i think yeah if you want to get

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,960
involved

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,640
and you're studying just start reaching

00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,400
out to people and and

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,319
find something that you want to actually

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,960
work on i think that's one of the keys

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,880
don't just

00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,079
you know spray and pray everywhere just

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,960
find something and

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,640
usually if you're you know if you're

00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,599
messaging me you probably have to take a

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,960
few

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,200
tries because uh i don't read my emails

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,599
and

00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,920
and i try to focus on my coding but yeah

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
if you're emailing a top level ceo maybe

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,520
you can

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,200
email someone a couple of levels or like

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,359
a periphery team member

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,559
or message them and get in touch with

00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,119
them and find out how you can get

00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,799
involved

00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,319
that might be a good way into most

00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,920
organizations

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,000
sounds good so basically what we're

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,400
saying for just network just start and

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,760
then just start networking just message

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,720
people hit people up

00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,520
um yeah as you said i've found that most

00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,040
um

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,319
engineers or um technical people whether

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,960
it's physically technical

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:06,480
or digitally technical um if they're the

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,559
founder and the ceo then you're gonna

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,240
have to try a fair few times to get them

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,440
um but most people are pretty good at

00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,359
responding this is what i love about

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,720
this digital world right is that no one

00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:18,160
is untouchable

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:21,359
um you know you can message anyone on

00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,200
linkedin twitter even instagram i got

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,880
people who message me on instagram about

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,319
like you know can we sponsor a hackathon

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,440
i'm like how do you find me on instagram

00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:29,119
like

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,880
um so i think that's what you just need

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,720
to do right and you've

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,079
summarized it perfectly to us just go

00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,359
and start something

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,880
you know if there's something that

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,839
you're interested in whether it's

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,200
postgres

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,040
whether it's a link so whether it's

00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,680
javascript whether it's python

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,760
just go find a project preferably with a

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,559
pretty ready fun and amazing discussion

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,839
board

00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,839
go and find a project and just start

00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:52,319
contributing too so i think um

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,280
yeah those those are great and um we've

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,040

00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,720
well we're pretty much on time are there

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,000

any last minute questions coming through

00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,480
from the chat uh

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,079
i can't think of anything in particular

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,720
but yeah i mean shout out to

00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,000
um everyone who so far got involved and

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,079
started building because

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you know we're an alpha takes a bit of

00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,240
bravery especially people are building

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,200
you know live products in production

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,359
with us so

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,520
i just want to shout out to a lot of

00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:27,520
these people and there's been many and

00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,440
really because our platform is quite

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,920
generic you can build sort of anything

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,599
on it

00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,200
you've seen everything from agencies

00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,880
coming in to you know the chrome

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,160
extensions that i told you before

00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,920

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,160
so shout out to those people in

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,200
particular who have a sub stack

00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
is

00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,960
