um which is really cool um

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
i don't think they were originally

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,559
created for the game off but then um

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
once we announced the um the game of

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,160
theme it sort of just worked

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,840
really nicely with um what we have the

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
theme issues like we'll use it

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,520

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,439

the way the stream is gonna work today

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,799
is we're gonna go

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,840
through some of our staff top picks uh

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,280
now each game isn't necessarily

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,079

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,640
like

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,920
different categories or whatever and

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,320
i'll talk a little bit about how the

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,680
submissions and things work as well i'm

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,840
gonna go through the games

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
and then at the end of the stream we're

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
gonna try something new so for those of

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,159
us who've been on open source friday

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
before

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,960
um you this is something new for you all

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,079
so it's gonna be really exciting so

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,240
after we're done here we're going to

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
jump over to the community forums where

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
you can kind of continue the

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,040
conversation with

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,439
either myself or other people who you

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
met on the stream or people who

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,719
maybe didn't get to come to the stream

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
and have those conversations so that's

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
gonna be fun i'm quite excited about

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,119
that

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,399
um but let's talk about the github game

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,400
off for those of you

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:18,800
who haven't seen it before uh so this is

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,920
the github game off page for 122.

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,760
how exciting so um you'll see this is a

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
very similar background which i think

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
it's hilarious

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
um so the theme for this year's game off

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,640
was moonshot

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,160
which is why using these um graphics

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
made it really cool because it was like

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
oh look we're going to the moon

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
so a lot of moonshot ideas of this used

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
game

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
oh hey whoa what the heck lee riley got

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,519
on band

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,440
what that's not cool

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,519
um let me actually try really quickly

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
lee riley to make you a moderator so

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
everyone say hi to lee

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,239
um so lee is the guy who runs github

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,840
game off so say hi to him

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
i'm gonna see if i can make you a

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,200
moderator

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,840
quickly i might not be able to

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,840
but let's have a look here

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,360
maybe not moderation

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,519
looks like i can

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
maybe not i don't think i have like a

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,319
full more access

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,319
um

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
maybe not maybe not maybe not maybe not

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
okay i will just share messages on your

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,120
behalf lee feel free to

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
um we'll get you sorted so you have mod

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
status i don't know why you don't

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,319
already

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,599
um but lee feel free to

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,879
um write the same thing and then

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,400
um like without the link the reason why

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
it's not working is because

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
we we disabled links because lots of

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
random people like

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,000
to put random links in the stream but um

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,599
that's what lee said some amazing

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959

thank you lee for being uh for doing so

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
much work on the game off and putting it

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
all together

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960
so we're gonna go over the highlights

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
real at the end i don't want to spoil

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,360
any of the games that we're going to be

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,919
talking about

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,880
um so fun fact on all the games i

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,080
haven't played

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
any of them until today um when i say

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
today i mean

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,560
i haven't played any of them we're about

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
to play them for the first time and the

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,360
reason why i didn't want to play them to

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,800
start off with or to like

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,160
have a preview so to show you how

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,160
easy quick complicated

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
like they are to play from first stand

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,560
it's a good question from taking me out

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
of just how they're made so i'm going to

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,840
go through each one

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,360
lee has given me some really really cool

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,960
insights on each game

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,080
um so the game off is an open gaming jam

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,600
you can create

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,240
any type of game any type of engine

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,360
um obviously the theme is moonshot but

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
you can kind of take that however you

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
want

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
so unlike js 13k games that we showed

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
off

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,000
recently which is this one here which i

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,759
uh

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,880
7k games this is specifically

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
oh no what happened lee i got a message

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,759
saying

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,840
oh you got time now sorry i'm banned

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,520
i have to keep like unbanning you i

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,440
don't yeah we um

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
not on my streams but on some of the

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
github streams we've had some people

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,360
like trying to like just spam links so i

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
think they

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
ended up banning one there we go i just

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
stopped banning me i'm not banning you

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,520
it's like auto banned i'm sorry

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,360
okay so i'm like just 13k games which is

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,759
you have to build a game

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
in javascript it has to be 13 kilobytes

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,800
or less

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
that's not what game off is game off is

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
much more um

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,560
open and fluid submissions which is why

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
we get so many so we had

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,160
it says here 499 submissions but the

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,120
actual final count was just over 500

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
so we had just over 500 submissions

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
which was

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,039
really exciting for um for this year's

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,160
game or

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,080
last year's game of 2020 holy we're in

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,280
2021 what the heck

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,400
uh okay so this is

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,759
this year's games super fun and again

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
the theme is moonshot but you can build

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
them in anything

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,440
so if we have a look here like lee's

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
had put together all this cool stuff

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,720
which is like some

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
tips to people who have never gone into

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,400
game development as well

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
so you can see here like some of the

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
tips that leigh

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,240
had mentioned was like you know if

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,120
you're like into javascript try fraser

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
um phaser sorry not fraser phaser i

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,479
think i said

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,560
uh if you're into c plus plus or c sharp

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,560
obviously unity is a really good one

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,639
unreal engine as you want a godot's a

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,759
really good one hey starshade how are

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,879
you

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,599
welcome into the game of stream

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
super exciting and super fun um

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,919
obviously we've got pie game

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,039
python um godot is another good one for

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
python

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,319
um actually i'm gonna zoom in here too

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,319
because sometimes

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
i realize that on stream it looks really

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
tiny uh

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
lots of different things like pikro

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,039
pixel um

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
basic there's lots of different ways you

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
can build games so

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
basically anyone could submit any kind

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,279
of game

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,120
they want uh apart aside from the fact

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,200
that the theme is moonshot there's no

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,680
other real restrictions

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,640
um you obviously have to put the game on

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,920
github

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,360
um yeah and then um so each of the games

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
that we go into

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
uh we will have a look at their githubs

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,480

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,360
hosted on this um

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,440
itch.io platform which is a really good

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
platform if you want to host

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,080
any kind of game jams community sessions

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560

game off so game off submissions again

they happen every november which is

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
literally what we're just about to talk

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
about so every november they go for um

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,800
the month of november

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
um obviously it says for us second

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
november because we're in australia

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,920
we're ahead of everyone

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
so it happens on the first november pt

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
time so us time

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,440
um what's really cool about the game of

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
two is the fact that there's like

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
all this community stuff so if you look

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,279
at the community

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,880
um they have a discord they have topics

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,240
they have promote games like

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
check out like stuff so you can check

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
out a discord server and things like

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
that

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,399
look i i haven't i haven't wrote a

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
little topic there

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
um and then there's like all the

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
screenshots for different games and i'm

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,560
going to go like

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
um we're not going to spoil those at the

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,959
moment but there's all the submissions

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
there

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
but one of the coolest things is github

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
game off

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,240
is not actually judged

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,760
by like a panel of judges or anything so

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
one of the coolest things about github

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,360
game off is it's

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
all community voting so if you submit a

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
game

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,440
you get the option to vote for a game

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,440
and there's

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,120
always i think it's first second third

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
or at least first and second

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,240
and then there's um like a few different

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,920
categories as well

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,880
um for the game so yeah

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,839
like yeah so there's like a bunch how

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,160
many different categories do we have lee

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,160
for for the games obviously like there's

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,600
yeah i know we have first and second at

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,959
least

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
i think we got like first second and

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
third and there's like a few different

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,959
categories it's kind of similar to like

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,320
json game games

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,079
six yeah it goes six different

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
categories zero you count

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
squeak out the wall right why are you

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,600
counting them let's fire up the first

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
game

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,880
so the first game is called

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,560
paraluna this was a game that got

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,399
second um in our

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
in the github game of um

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,760

i'll put it in here as well okay so the

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,920
first game is paraluna

remronts

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
um and if we have a look at their repo

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
as you can see actually that's pinned at

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,760
the top as well

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,040
uh so here is para luna the

00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,240
repo as well so i've got all games ready

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,639
um to go i also have a keyboard mouse

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
and

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
a controller depending on the type of

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,120
game that they're

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,480
going to or whether like i think some of

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,560
the games what i

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480
briefly saw may have controller

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
capabilities so we'll see what happens

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,320
but again i haven't played any of these

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
games before this is gonna be my first

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
run

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,560
of each of the games um and we're gonna

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,440
see

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:28,800
like from like our point of view like

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,600
whether the game is intuitive easy to

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,680
run the controls are good the graphics

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,560
music gameplay all that kind of stuff so

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
let's zoom in nice and big on here

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
paraluna

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
i like i like this graphic it's kind of

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
cool

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,160
all right so let's pause our background

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
music oh yeah dark mode for the win

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
yeah actually yeah this is github dark

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,959
mode if anyone hasn't seen it so

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,160
previously i was writing an extension

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,040
for dark mode called dark reader um now

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,560
i can actually

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,959
switch the entire thing off because

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,000
github has native dark mode so if you go

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,440
to your

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,880
um settings on github

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
um and you go down to this like

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,519
appearance um you can choose your theme

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,959
also if you're just on your home page it

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,000
should have like a little toggle

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,120
on your homepage here at the top here so

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
like it's got your little

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
little um kitty cat at the top here so

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,880
you go dark

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
light

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,759
i'm so excited i can actually show off

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
actual dark theme

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,920
um because previously like everyone

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
would be like whoa github has a dark

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,160
mode i'm like

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,639
no it's just me running dark reader

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,120
which actually in itself dark reader in

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
itself is open source so this is the one

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
we're using

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,279
um so for those people who have websites

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,040
that don't have that

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,560
why is dark reader turn it on

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
and then we just make sure that it's off

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,120
we github

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,920
ah yeah i had it off already there we go

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,600
so this is all nate so this is uh dark

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,279
grader which is what i was using before

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
to make my github look dark because i

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
want to be on stream going oh wow

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,079
get up looks so good dark and i knew

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,959
dark boy was coming i had to like keep

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,120
it quiet

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
um so that's actual dark radar and then

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,400
if i like

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,280
that um you should be able to say um it

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,000
almost

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,839
it's protected by browser but most

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
things you can go see like dark mode but

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,400
like

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
so many websites these days have um like

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,679
a dark mode anyway

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,720
um yeah which is pretty good so like

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
even facebook

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
it's like dark moon and stuff um but

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,120
yeah this is our actual github dark mode

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
but yeah party time

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
all right let's actually go play this

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,360

then like

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,840
jump again is like to fire your

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,039

trampolines

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,480
okay that's kind of cool

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,359
oh oh because i hit it on the side okay

00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,839
there's a slight glitch if you hit the

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:11,839
side

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:11,839
it doesn't work

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:26,720
oh there's a cloud

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,000

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,319
get it's

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,000
it's per thing so you what you need to

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,720
do is you need to like do it a number of

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,800
times so you can buy like

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,240
extra things so you get like a bigger

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
catapult

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,920
let's try that there you go so a big

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,720
catapult now

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,359
so she'll be able to get further so you

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,200
gotta keep going until you get like

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,200
enough fish to eventually get you to the

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,599

wow okay this is gonna be interesting

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
it's like one of the very first movies

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,839
um

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:34,000
the art was made using unity the engine

00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:37,040
itself let's have a look

00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,440
got some cool background music and also

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,200
yeah inspired by the voyage

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,040
of the moon so this is like one of the

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,160
very first motion pictures

00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,960
ever um it wasn't hitchcock

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,920
it was um george milliers that's it i

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,000
actually did a

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:58,880
um a project on this um

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,200
in uni yeah this is it you haven't

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,559
actually seen trip to the moon

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,559
so it's a silent film

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,839
but yeah it's like they're all they're

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,599
like

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,440
talking about wanting to go to the moon

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,319
and then like they actually

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,920
like build a thing and then they

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,920
actually

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,440
get to the moon it's really funny here

00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,119
we go

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,520
all right there it is so they literally

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,000
like fire the rocket

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,359
and obviously it's a silent film because

00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,200
they didn't have any

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,200
anything back in the day um

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,839
and then they go launch it boom

00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,119
and then it goes yeah they're like oh we

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:46,079
launched the thing

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,640
and then there's the moon and it just

00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,040
goes

00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,640
the rocket comes in and there's a face

00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,359
on the moon because that's what they saw

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,800
man on the moon and then the man on

00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,119
moon's just sitting there just minding

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,440
his own business so 1902 and

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,520
rocket just gets stuck in his face um so

00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,520
that's what this is inspired by this

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,119
game

00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,480
morning move facebook give you

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,520
nightmares yeah

00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:14,880
yeah maybe alrighty

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,280
so um let us

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,720
jump in and see what this one is so

00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,680
they've even got a trailer for it which

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,800
is really cool

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,440
fun fact or not fun fact but fact um

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,839

01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,520
it's built with pico eight as well which

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,640
is why it's sports eight players no

01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,119
that's not actually why

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,920
apparently this game is rather difficult

01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,030
um

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:58,109

have to do

01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,960

01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,800
these game off streams depending on how

01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,159

01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,679
know for sure

01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,199
is that you're up to no good oh they're

01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,719
up to no good i was like what am i doing

01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:02,159
wrong

01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,159
it involves the mooncakes

01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:07,760
this is really nice scrappy i love how

01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,760
everything's like moving slowly

01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:15,760
i'll do it this is a perilous journey

01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:19,520
child

01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:21,600
if you do go do you wish to go

01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,000
you always have to play with anyone but

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,199
i think well lee is over in the us so

01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,400
they're obviously a little bit um

01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,280
crazy on covet at the moment then going

01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:35,199
to see people is a bit difficult

01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,719
still just hold for one second and there

01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,239
we go now before we head out let's go

01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,400
over how this ability works

01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,560
it seems we have a visitor time for some

01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,159
on the job training hold down rice

01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,590
button if you use the moonbay aim it

01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:52,279
using your mask

[Music]

01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,350
now we'll figure it out as we're going i

01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,800
guess

01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:24,480
[Music]

01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,250
you're a natural as you use the ability

01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,679
when it becomes a clip since

01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:30,320
[Music]

01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,760
it lessens that's kind of when it's

01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,560
known yes the moon will share

01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,239
return to its former state and your face

01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:40,159
you wasn't when you can serve the moon

01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:40,159
manner oh the moon is your manner

afraid of using that weapon

01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,960
speaking of seems to be having an

01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,960
automatic guess in tacky

01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:59,360
very good i'm beginning to think this is

01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:02,000
faith that led to this journey

01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,719
shooting stars using your ability oh

01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,719

01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:38,239
holding on there

01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:38,239

else well the moons won't matter huh

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:09,840
okay so yeah you just aim your beam at

01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:09,840
them and they've changed

01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
okay

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,960
okay so basically you just gotta like

01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:32,400
jump away from the

01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:37,840
things i don't know it says you can get

01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,840
the shooting stars

01:19:49,920 --> 01:20:05,840
this is on a perilous journey looks like

01:19:52,159 --> 01:20:05,840
they're like weights at the front

01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:33,840
look at the shipwrecks and everything

01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:33,840
it's such a cute game

01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:41,100
[Music]

01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,840

[Music]

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,840
the moon doesn't have infinite amounts

01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,840
of matter i need you to die

01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,840
hot

01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,920
development is you don't

01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,239
do everything like someone's a dev and

01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:45,840
then

01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:45,840
someone does like art and animation and

01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,119
oh wow okay then we've got time for

01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:58,239
probably

01:52:55,119 --> 01:53:01,199
one more game it is also it's already

01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:04,719
past five but let's play one more game

01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:08,080

01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,480

01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:40,880
we

01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,320

okay you just gotta like keep them away

01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:33,119

four noses to go here well we haven't

01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:37,840
even done your top picks that's what i'm

01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,840
saying like

01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,800
rocket launcher

01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:53,280
no enough moon

01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,280
so where to get them first

01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:59,360
what's my moon doing oh we've got other

01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,360
things too

01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:08,560
whoa we're going to do that as well

01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:08,560
um a shell

01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:19,840
okay yup that's pretty cool

01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,840
health

01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:47,840
no enough random

01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,520
yeah you can watch yeah that'd be great

01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:58,960
that's all you do you just have this on

01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,960
the background like i don't

01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,320
have this like streams like this running

01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,000
in the background while they're just

01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:06,880
like

01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,520
having a bit of fun oh we died okay so

01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,000
that was

01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,520
the games for this week i reckon it's

01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,599
probably a good time to end we're

01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,119
over two hours on the stream now but

01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,320
we're going to go back and recap so

01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:17,360
it's still going to be like 15 20

01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,159
minutes before we actually end the

01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,840
stream

01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:21,599
all right so check him in and ask what

01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:25,119
the number one game of all the

01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:29,920
the game that won um the game that

01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:33,040
won overall was the trip to the moon one

01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,239
um so the one that was really fun to

01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,199
play with and also worked with

01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,599
controller

01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:38,239
uh so the trip to the moon was the one

01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:40,800
that won

01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:42,080
so this one here um don't forget to

01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:47,360
remember i said before

01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:47,360
like these games aren't um

01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:54,080
stopped remember no i said before too

01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,040
like these games aren't judged by like a

01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,199
judging panel

01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:59,520
these are judged by every single other

01:56:57,199 --> 01:57:03,119
person who submits a game right

01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:06,080
so if you submit a game you get to like

01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:07,440
you get to judge everyone else's game

01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:08,320
you obviously can't your own game

01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:09,520
but there's

01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:12,000
i think lee said six different

01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:15,599
categories so like development design

01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,639
animation stuff like that so this one

01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:20,560
one

01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:21,760
um this this game what did it win

01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,639
get rid of that i don't need that

01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:27,760
anymore what did this game win this game

01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:31,360

01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:33,440

01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:37,440
and also first place in graphics

01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:39,040
um the other one we played which was

01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
right at the start which we'll go back

01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,920

01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:43,199
as well one first place in game play and

01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,159

and also one the um artwork

01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:09,249
so it was both

01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:09,249
[Music]

01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,679
so yeah it's like oops

01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,840

01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:19,599
second overall was this one that we

01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,960

yeah it's all based on um yeah

02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,400
yeah exactly that could be valuable

different types of gaming platforms you

02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:54,960
can use for development so faze is the

02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:57,199
one that lee's talking about

02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,960

and it talks about the types of game

02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,320
engines you can use based on

02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,679
the programming language you're most

02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,960
familiar with so leigh's got a few

02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:10,400

get started in game programming if you

02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:33,599

so we can all chat about them this is a

02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,599
good way to come and find other people
