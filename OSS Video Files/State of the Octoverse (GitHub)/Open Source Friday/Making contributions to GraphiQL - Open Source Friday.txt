previously they know we're

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,799
focused on open source and

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
talking about how how would how to get

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,000
um i'm brian douglas bw on twitter but

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
i'm also bdugie on github

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
focused on developer relations at github

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,000
so primarily

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,439
in the open source space so i talk a lot

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,960
of maintainers talk about how they're

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
using the product and how we can improve

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
that experience

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,560
uh but why don't you go ahead and share

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
um what you do

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
ricky and uh your background and sort of

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
how you got into um

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,159
i guess to do an open source great yeah

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
um

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,160
so um yeah i've been uh doing software

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,080
development for about 11 or 12 years now

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
professionally i got started doing

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
drupal

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,160
and php and in the beginnings of like

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
when html5

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,480
first came out and you know

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
jquery and you know and um

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,480
kind of moved into building more and

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
more advanced things and realized that i

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
really wanted to

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,080
build full-fledged web applications and

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,560
at the time

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,239
node.js was the hot thing javascript

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
i think around that time angular had

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
just come out and things like that so it

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
was really exciting so i moved into that

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
and uh but had always been really

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
passionate about open source so

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,840
way back in college i was very

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
passionate about the concept of open

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
source and

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,040
even wrote papers on it and um

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,159
wait in college how long ago was that

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,239
well you don't have to date yourself

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
2008 yeah okay

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
yeah all right i graduated in 2008 yeah

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
i graduated the same year

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,319
yeah okay yeah so you know there's

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
you know grad school didn't look very uh

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
no it wasn't very promising at all no

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,879
not at all

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
that's why i got into tech um right

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
eventually got to tech but i'm curious

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
though you you're

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
you're i guess your exploration the open

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,200
source like yeah

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
continue that path and uh how you sort

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
of got there and what sort of papers you

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
wrote as well

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
oh great yeah so i was actually studying

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
anthropology

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
um and doing an ethnography project

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
about

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,040
um uh just

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
about how people taught each other to

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
garden and community

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
gardens and stuff and my friend was like

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
hey

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
you should really check out open source

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,080
because it's just the kind of like

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,920
economics and and people-powered

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
paradigms that you like to talk about

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
and i'm going to show you how to use

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
linux

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,799
to run your own survey servers instead

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
of using surveymonkey so i ran line

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,200
survey

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,680
this is my first time running php my

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,560
first time running linux i got a linux

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
and yeah and this is like well before i

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
would get paid to do it and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,919
um and then we also ran a time bank

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,919
um using oh what was it austin time

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,320
banks ruby on rails application at the

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,240
time

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,919
my buddy who's a grad student in

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,919
computer science at the time

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
showed me around ruby on rails showed me

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,800
more advanced bash commands and stuff

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,919
again i'm just in college you know an

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
anthro student

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,360
and you know so then i went and worked

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,280
for uh

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,040
americorps vista in 2008 i came back to

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,320
back home to my home city of cleveland

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
to live with my parents because it's

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,040
2008.

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,440
um let's be real and and um

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
and was working at this non-profit and

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,800
had been made the de facto tech person

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,120
um and was building out i think i built

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
this

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,960
ridiculous case management system in

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,880
access

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,479
right and i was really like i really

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
need to see what else is out there so at

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,720
the time i started teaching myself

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
drupal

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
i'd already done some wordpress stuff at

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,639
the time started building out more

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,280
advanced

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
applications but then yeah came into

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,400
doing freelance

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,840
um and after that americorps vista job

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,199
and you know i've been working in call

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,039
centers and as a barista

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
washing dishes all this stuff while

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,080
teaching myself open source in my free

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,960
time

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
and teaching myself uh you know at the

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,440
time i was learning php and my sequel

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,919
and javascript you know and

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,680
css everything and then you know before

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,759
i knew it i was building

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,759
you know nice little websites for

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,039
businesses nonprofits working with my

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
designer friend

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
we eventually started a worker co-op

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,240
called flywheel tech collective

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,960
and it was really great i don't suggest

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,440
running an agency right off the bat

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,199
uh working at bigger companies and

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,319
agencies teaches you a lot

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,400
and having more senior mentors like

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
we did great but i learned a lot more

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,800
when i started moving on to working as

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,240
a consultant with larger companies

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,600
and some of those folks one of those

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,000
people works at groupon now

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
another one runs his own screen printing

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
business

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,800
like it's you know we all moved on to do

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,720
our own things that we enjoyed

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
and what i found is i just kept wanting

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
more and more challenges

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,560
and so that's why i got into node.js and

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,759
then i was doing a lot with angular

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,039
1 and then got into react okay um when

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,440
that

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,120
when basically when angular 2 was still

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
an alpha i was like

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,039
you know this new react thing it looks

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,240
real tempting i was working for this

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,360
really cool startup

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
um and we we built this really cool

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
application

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
electron and react and node uh and

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
express

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,039
and i was just like yeah this is it i'm

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,400
just gonna keep building applications

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,080
like this and so

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,199
uh you know a couple projects after that

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,080
i start getting into graphql

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,360
and i was doing graphical on my own

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,479
really enjoyed it but

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,400
wanted to do a lot more and then started

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
working on really big schemas and

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,759
projects

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
to to really just push the envelope and

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,400
i really saw

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,000
the edges of where you know

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
graphql was starting to reach some of

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
its limitations and also i was at a

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
company where

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,919
um we just

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,759
by pushing the edges of graphql at the

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,639
time this is about three years ago we're

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
flat fast forwarding quite a bit here um

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,639
we

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,919
we started to see some of the

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,680
limitations and one of the biggest

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,520
limitations was something we needed that

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,720
was called input unions it's a

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,680
a polymorphic input spec

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,160
for input types in graphql that is you

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
can

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,240
have one um one

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,520
mutation uh that

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,160
can se can accept uh polymorphic input

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,199
yeah

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
and response which um yeah so i want to

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,160
go down the technical route but uh

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
i just want to give a shout out yeah

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
we'll get there eventually but

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
i want to give a shout out to bryce

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
bryceta

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,960
bryce ida um who's also an anthropology

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
uh

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,759
major as well um so shout out to them um

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,039
thanks for popping the chat so i i

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,240
wanted to get the technical stuff but i

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
also wanted to introduce you as a

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,199
maintainer

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
of graphical and part of the graphql

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,000
found foundation

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,599
um as well so um

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
i'm curious i think a lot of the

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,080
listeners are curious so maybe

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,680
everybody's

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
everybody's already involved in graphql

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,959
and that's why they're here but uh can

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,719
you explain graphql

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,480
what graphical is because sometimes it

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,760
could be hard to see the eye

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,760
as well ah yes the difference yes

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah maybe like go through the history

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,000
of like why do we have this this uh

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,959
system uh for querying yeah that's a

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
great question

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
yeah um you might even know a better way

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,800
of describing this than me

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
but uh yeah it's such a big graphql fan

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,080
but um graphql

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,640
is basically just um a meta query

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,519
language

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,760
right you have sql which is usually

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,240
pretty specific for databases but

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,279
graphql is a way of interfacing with

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
data

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,880
um in a way that's implementation

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,160
agnostic

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,880
right so that you could potentially

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,399
you know be using it to make http

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
queries

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,760
or you could be using it for websocket

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,240
subscriptions or you could be

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
using much more advanced implementations

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
for

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
um that i've seen for machine learning

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
and other things that aren't using http

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,720
at all they're

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,399
running no http servers they're directly

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
querying a file system

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,040
or they're querying an advanced database

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
of some kind so

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
um it's it's a very multi-purpose query

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
language

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,480
um and it also uh

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
is really nice for client consumers

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,160
because then they can describe exactly

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,640
the data they want to get back

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
and it eases up that client server

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
contract if you've ever worked at a big

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,160
company

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,200
or or any company that has separate

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,000
front end and back end teams there's

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
always that push

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
pull of oh well we need another route we

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
need another argument for this we need

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
another field for this

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
but if you instead give front-end

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,680
developers the ability

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,079
to construct queries

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,800
for exactly the data they want alias

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
things

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,519
and insert and yeah it

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
you can just do cool stuff yeah yeah and

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,200
so facebook

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,320
uh created this in-house um and

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,360
um they it was it really took off

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,160
and they launched the open graph project

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,680
or the open graph api i think that was

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,560
the original implementation

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,160
of it and eventually got to the point

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
where they said hey let's open source

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,959
this

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,800
which is what facebook tends to do as we

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,720
notice they really incubate something

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,399
in-house until they decide

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,360
to make it open source and they did and

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,480
you uh me and brian and other developers

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
at the time were like

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,240
whoa this is amazing you know there's a

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
couple other things kind of like it but

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
nothing quite like this

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,040
yeah so you mentioned your uh your

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
introductory

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
into like react and then eventually

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
graphql i had a very similar

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
introduction so i'm sorry to cut you off

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
but

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
um i had the same aha moment where i was

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,240
using angular 1.

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,680
angular 2 came out as a spec and got

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,200
delayed a couple times

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
and at that time we had a new project

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
where i had to use react

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,640
and uh that went over very well and very

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
quickly we were able to ship it in a

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
couple months with me no hardly any

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
javascript experience like i had

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
experience but i didn't know what i was

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,680
doing i was a coffeescript

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,639
fan at that time so when it came time to

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,440
build

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,600
a similar app using the same data layer

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
but for a mobile

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
then react came out sorry react native

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,800
came out

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,560
a couple years like maybe a year after

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
the whole angular 2 stuff

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
and then uh at that point i was trying

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,720
to figure out ways to query the data

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
for the react native app and relay was

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,959
like

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
something i ignored for so long which

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,920
also came out of facebook

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,440
and it was like an easy way for me to

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,880
interact between that data layer

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
because i only had two screens on for

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,839
mobile and i was just sort of figuring

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
it out at that point

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,000
so i had the aha moment of like oh wow i

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
have this entire existing data layer

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
that i don't want all of it like i don't

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
need this entire project

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,279
but i need to create two screens for a

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,519
mobile experience so let me try react

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
native oh and also graphql

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
and it's funny that you mentioned your

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,360
access experience too

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,399
outside of college is yeah if you ever

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
use access

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,959
like you know that's nothing but

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,720
querying data and trying to figure out

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,720
how to manipulate that so

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,320
yeah it's a like you seem very

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,360
experienced to be now at the point where

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,720
you're maintaining

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,320
now graphical yeah i was actually

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,000
uh kinda i if you had told me

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,519
two years ago i'd be doing this now i

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,399
wouldn't have believed you to be honest

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
cause

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
up until that point whenever i created

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
open source project i'd i'd be lucky to

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,120
get like 50 downloads a month

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
you know on npm um i remember one time i

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,560
published a cli

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
for generating pdfs and then took it

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,040
down

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
a few months later because i realized

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,160
how buggy it was like

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,480
i was you know like most of us you know

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
we

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
we when we start creating an open source

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
project

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,880
and publishing it you know it's hard to

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
get traction you know

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,120
and um i never saw myself as

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,200
as eventually being an open source

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,040
maintainer but yeah like

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
uh you know after facebook had been

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,240
supporting this for a while i was at

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,079
this company and we just saw

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,920
how some of the core parts of it were

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,199
starting to falter a bit you know you

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
could see that

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,160
the the maintainer ship wasn't quite as

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,320
strong as it had been before

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
and no faults on facebook they had a lot

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
on their plate and they were probably

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
starting to realize themselves

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,519
that it was getting there and companies

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,880
were contributing to the graphql

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,600
ecosystem

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,600
but not as much to the core ecosystem as

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,519
it seemed was needed especially to start

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,839
advancing new language features

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,519
so i just started opening prs i saw the

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,399
input union was happening and i just

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,160
said hey

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,320
i'm going to go help with this pr i'm

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
going to create a pr to implement it in

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,880
graphical

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,160
at the time i was able to reach out to

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,040
tim greiser on

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,800
github to get started and actually my

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,920
old college buddy who showed me ruby on

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,680
rails when i'd already started

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,600
just so happened to be involved in that

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,360
he's a new relic vince foley

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
uh he just so happened to be involved in

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,839
all that as well so

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
it was just kind of like oh like yeah

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,800
this

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
sounds like you know so i'm curious you

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
mentioned the input unit thing a couple

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
times and you're

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,399
you started opening up pr's like how did

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,000
you get up the

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
like the ability or the skill how did

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,680
you know you had enough skill to be able

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,560
to even do that

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
to be honest i didn't think i did yeah

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,320
when they're like

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
uh can you um you know fix this in this

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
pr

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,320
can you open a pr to add this to the

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
graphical i started looking at the code

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
and i was like

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,800
how am i going to figure this out um and

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
luckily i was at a point where i was

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,480
between jobs

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,639
and you know i just

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
it was just like you know what this is

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,480
my chance this is my chance to really

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,600
get into open source and prove

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,519
that i'm capable of of

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
helping to maintain or at least

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
contribute to open source projects i

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,560
contributed to projects in the past

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,000
a couple prs here and there like all of

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
us you know where

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
you know you're just trying to help you

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,079
want to add the one feature that you had

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,240
to add for work

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,199
and the maintainer helps you merge it

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,959
and it's great

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,199
but i wanted some a more committed

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,240
relationship and i was like graphql is a

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,639
language that i want to

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
be involved in and i don't see other

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,839
people

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,800
contributing what i think needs to be

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
there so

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
let's make it happen so yeah i started

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
doing that and i just said

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,880
hey you know what is ast like i didn't

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
even know what an

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
abstract syntax tree was and i was

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,639
working on

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,759
you know a pr that touches the parser

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,360
and the lexer

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
and all these different parts of the

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
core graphql

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,240
uh repository but then

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,320
you know i started learning about

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
graphical and all the linkages that it

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,360
had so

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,360
at the time i would have to yarn link

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,160
about six different repositories

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
together

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,480
yeah in order to develop this to add

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,480
this new language feature

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,680
um and so i created these six different

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
prs

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,519
went back to the original graphql rfc

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,600
pr and said hey here's how we're

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,880
implementing it in graphical

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,839
um and here i made a diagram too

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,759
to show how complex these linkages are

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,000
and wink wink wouldn't it be cool if we

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,279
made this model repo and these three

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,959
repos one mono repo

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
and people were impressed and they had

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
me

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,559
join for the graphical working group

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,240
call i think that's when i started

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,439
working with benji too

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,720
and um and i just showed

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,720
how to use input union in in in

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
graphical right and i showed here it is

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,079
working here it is in the doc explorer

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,760
you can see which input types this input

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,199
union maps to

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,400
um but yeah that took a lot of work

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,080
i probably like not to glorify working

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
yourself to death because that's not my

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720
normal mo

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,360
uh but i did push myself real hard

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
to to learn and dedicate myself to

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,160
working through

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,520
certain problems um and just kind of

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,120
would just pick problems um and tackle

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,039
them one at a time

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
make sure the tests pass make sure that

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,600
this feature works and find different

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
ways

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,720
to confirm that different things were

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,880
working across the ecosystem

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,799
so yeah it was really just kind of like

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,960
feeling around in the dark

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,000
at first but eventually it felt more and

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
more light

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
and um there's still times where i look

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
at parts of

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,200
even inside the graphical monorepo where

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,559
i'm like whoa

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,240
and i have to like reset because it is

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,640
it language tooling can be very um

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,840
overwhelming if you're used to more you

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,240
know application

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,520
development-oriented tooling it's it's a

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
different way of thinking of things but

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,679
once you start to

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,440
understand ast and you learn how the

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,840
core graphql

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,840
library can be used the graphql

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,280
reference implementation

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,280
it becomes less and less intimidating um

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,039
and uh yeah yeah and the the other thing

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
that was helpful to learn was lsp

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
language server protocol which we can

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
get into

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,480
later yeah i'm sure there's some

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
examples in the repo that you can walk

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
us through

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,880
as well and um yeah yeah i think

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
everybody here is probably super

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,280
interested in like getting that

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
information of how to

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,880
how they can contribute also how can

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
they get sort of like the cliff notes of

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
what they need to know for the project

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,400
um nerd super user um actually just

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,000
threw in the chat

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,679
um well earlier when we were talking

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
about sort of contributing

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,880
uh you just don't know when you're good

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,720
enough so you just and i responded that

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
you just got to do and he also responded

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,679
as well

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,480
you start into it you get into flow uh

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,720
and sometimes

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
you just have to try uh and i like the

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,640
the fact that you you mentioned there's

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
a working

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,160
group call or something like that that

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,919
you were invited to can you talk about

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
that a little bit

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,679
yeah it's free for anyone to attend uh

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,520
the graphql working group

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,360
and um it's hosted by grapco foundation

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,640
benji will be there taking notes

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,160
faithfully and

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,320
leads usually there everyone ivan

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,559
and other people who maintain things but

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,679
also representatives from different

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
companies that use

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,400
graphql and just interested people

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,679
hobbyists someone that has a new really

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,799
cool project they want to show

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
people usually the the focus of the

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
graphical working group call and it's a

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,440
monthly call

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,720
usually the focus is on advancing the

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,840
specification

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,840
yeah um and and adding

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,480
and making decisions about how the

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,559
graphql language should continue to work

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,400
it's a pretty amazing call to just

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,480
attend and listen to

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,559
usually when i attend is just to listen

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,280
because especially with uh

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,799
stream and defer i love streaming

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
implementations but these

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
folks have taken it real far and it's

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,640
amazing are the new scalers

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,159
the new remote scalers implementation

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,840
amazing stuff

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,159
uh i need to do my homework to be honest

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,000
so if anyone else feels overwhelmed when

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
they see things coming out of the spec

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,400
body

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,320
um and are on the fence over whether

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,320
they should attend i would just say go

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,720
for it because you'll learn so much

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,720
if you want to learn how to help advance

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
new features in the graphql language or

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,320
help

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,760
um you know kind of bolster the existing

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
tooling that's there

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
and join in any of these amazing open

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,440
source projects um

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,240
it's a great place to get started yeah

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,919
and yeah yeah so i'm curious uh just

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
take a look at the chat if anybody has

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,520
experience in graphql do you use graphql

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,679
are you consuming it

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
let us know in the chat i'd love to get

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,280
some idea of what the audience here

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,600
who's here i see sean's here

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,480
sean thanks for popping in there giving

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
your

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
your your uh props to relay because i

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,440
know you're a big relay fan i think

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,480
you've convinced me to

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,919
uh to leverage relay a bit more um

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
but ricky while we're waiting for the

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,360
chat to respond also chad if you have

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
any questions about graphql graphical as

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,840
well

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,720
please pop them in there uh you're we're

here

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,919
for you this conversation is for you so

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,039
if you want to help guide our

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,440
conversation and what we're talking

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,720
about

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
uh just drop in the chat and we'll

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,320
figure it out uh but i'm going to

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,960
transition us to being able to

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,919
share the screen so that way we can talk

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,000
through

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
sort of first look at the the project

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
but also

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,400
how do you find out some of this like

00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
information that she had mentioned

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,960
before

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,039
so um yeah there we go i'm gonna

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,919
pop over to the share screen so that way

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
you can see it as well

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,000
excellent all right so you should be

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,679
able to see my screen now

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,080
yeah and then the chat should be able to

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,520
see everything as well oh nice

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,200
oh nice i don't know if i'm seeing this

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
new version of

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,480
oh yeah so wait you know what we did

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
ship a um

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,080
this is still in uh it's still being

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,480
beta tested but we did ship a new ui

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,640
uh and i wanted to keep this in normally

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
i hide my uh my github staff bar

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
but um in order to show the new ui i

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
wanted to actually show this so

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,880
hopefully it's not gonna throw you off

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,000
too much because things are

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,679
moved to the sidebar a bit but

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,520
basically what i have here is just a

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,679
graphql repo

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
i imagine that there are two places that

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,000
people will probably

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,400
end up googling uh that's actually the

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,400
wrong thing

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,159
i mistype it all the time like still

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,159
and i'll have to double take is that

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,320
graphical or graphql

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,360
yeah especially some of these fonts too

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,840
as well they can be a little

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,960
a little crazy especially in the uh uh

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,720
these uis

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,240
so i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna hide

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
ourselves to the right a little bit

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,360
um so i basically just have two sites

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
i'm just looking at the chat too as well

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
it looks like

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,000
i've been thinking of migrating apis to

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,799
graphql as supposed to be better than

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,640
rest we can address that question uh in

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,480
a bit and then started using it for the

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,200
client side fumbling my way through it

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
now

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,720
all right we should address that too as

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,480
well and use it for your own projects

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,799
bryceeta you know these switch handles

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,840
are

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,520
they're challenging um and then nerds

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
the super user we need dark theme

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,279
we need the the dark theme yes that is

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,159
true we need that dark theme we have it

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,080
on mobile

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,120
uh and in particular for the github uh

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,840
ui we'll have the dark theme uh sorry no

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,960
promises

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,159
but we should um but yeah where do you

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,240
want to start like we can address these

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,760
questions or we can uh

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,640
uh we start with the introduction of the

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,640
the repo as well

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,520
yeah well i think i don't think i even

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,679
finished your first question because i

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,520
tend to trail on like that but uh

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,440
no worries uh graph graph iql

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,720
um uh is

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,240
basically uh it's an ide and so it's

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
like it's meant to be the reference

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
originally it was the the

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,360
very simple the purpose is just a simple

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,880
reference

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,720
ide implementation for the web

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,720
it's used by many many different

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
language communities outside the node

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,480
community

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,760
it's easy for us to feel so insular

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,080
and node and tight script land

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,039
that we don't realize that there's you

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,159
know there's python and java developers

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,960
and elixir

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,480
and russ i hope i'm covering everyone uh

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,799
you'll miss them like there's

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,039
yeah i mean this there's a graph there's

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
a jupiter notebook plug-in for graphical

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,799
there's

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,520
you know there's there's it just spans

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,200
well beyond

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,520
my even understanding of programming

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,320
um and how it's implemented right and

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,240
that's kind of this really fun sometimes

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,440
intimidating thing but we decided

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,640
last year on the same call where

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,159
facebook handed it over to the graphical

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,480
foundation

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:31,919
the original maintainers angel gomez

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,640
um and jio lee and

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,120
who else is there um i think maybe lee

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,600
was that lee byron was there as well

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,039
uh where they said hey on behalf of

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,559
facebook

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,440
um graphical is

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,640
is now um we're giving graphical to the

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,600
graphical foundation

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
and the rest of the language tooling um

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,480
and

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
you know within a couple weeks we were

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,760
changing all the copyrights

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,960
and the license it felt so real i think

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
i don't even think it was i can't

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
remember what it was before but it

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,279
wasn't even mit before so it was like

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
it was a facebook thing uh their special

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,880
license

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
yeah their spatial facebook license yeah

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,760
so so a lot of what we've done since

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,159
then

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
is just like most of the last year we

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
spent

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,480
combining these projects into a

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,520
reference mono repo

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
that made it very easy to um make

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
changes

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,440
across the language tooling like what

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,679
i'll

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,720
go into more depth about the lsp

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,039
and then the code mirror mode and

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
the graphical implementation itself have

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
all required

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,559
a lot of modernizing work to get there

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,279
it's very much like a rehab

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,480
like a rehabbing an old building in the

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,000
sense that

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
at its time it was a great

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,919
implementation of react like when it was

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,760
first created that was the way to build

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,000
react applications yeah but there was a

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,440
lot of things like using globals

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,200
um and so you know there was a lot of uh

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,720
like you you spent a lot of time just i

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,440
think the last time i heard about this

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
uh

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
modern like modernizing the graphical uh

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,799
repo

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,799
was like late last year or maybe almost

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
late last year but um you spent a lot of

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,640
time just

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
updating stuff that wasn't touched for a

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,120
while is that correct

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
uh yeah just updating things just making

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,679
sure it worked with the latest

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,799
uh version of graphql the latest

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
language features

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,679
to migrating

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,679
from browserify to webpack

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,200
yeah it looks like uh alejandra actually

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,960
has yeah more good pretty good questions

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,120
yeah that is something that we've been

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,799
trying to work on and the problem is and

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,480
that i'm getting to is that so we

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,240
decided during that call that we're

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,720
going to add a plug-in api

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,320
the users just really wanted to build a

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,919
plug-in api so not only do we have to do

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,840
all this modernizing work

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,000
which we've mostly finished by now um

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,760
uh well actually well we haven't totally

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,559
finished because there's a modernizing

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,000
of the react

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,200
implementation which is a whole um

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,240
pr in itself so to answer that question

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,399
um kind of requires a couple things it

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,240
requires

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:20,320
um so we we we're concurrently working

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,679
towards 1.0 and 2.0 at the same time

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,559
but one point hasn't shipped yet uh not

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,919
not fully yet it's just about two um the

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,640
1.0 beta

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,679
uh we added we have a feature freeze on

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,360
1.0

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,360
and all the new features are going into

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,799
2.0 which is where we're doing the

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,399
rewrite the redesign

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,399
and the plug-in api yeah so there's a

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,559
pull request that's been opened forever

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,760
and to answer your question alejandro

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,679
there's some pinned issues in

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,679
um there's one that's a meta issue

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:58,240
um where uh it kind of helps you

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
explore oh wait where'd the meta issue

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,399
go oh there it is right there

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,880
the 2.0 beta meta issue okay so

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,480
this and i'm going to be improving this

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,640
more and adding more to it

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,799
but this shows the kind of the big steps

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
we needed to accomplish

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,080
um to even start working on the plugin

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,799
api

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,159
and now we're really close so in fact i

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,000
could even check off that

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,919
that third item there and work in

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,200
progress and add more work in progress

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,320
so right now

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,760
um we are in the middle of implementing

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
the redesign

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,919
um we've already

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,919
um it's all in one pr mostly like a it's

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,279
a big giant feature branch

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
called uh feet slash uh use context

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,200
hooks

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,279
right so once we get 1.0 out there then

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,720
we're going to merge that into master

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,799
and that is um it's uh it's

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
graphical rewrite for monaco editor

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,279
react context and redesign

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,000
so if you see the rfc prs those are

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:01,200
being made against that one yeah

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,559
gotcha um and so a lot of those have

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
been merged because they're just small

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,919
ones but eventually

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,480
the plug-in api is going to be an rfc

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,720
against 1523 until 1523

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,919
gets merged and then we then we're going

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
to have lots of rfc prs

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,440
to add different features to the core

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,200
and start adding plug-ins so

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,440
i already started working on the first

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,200
plug-in a couple weeks ago

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,799
but we decided we'd gotten ahead of

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,279
ourselves and needed to shore up

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
things with the monaco implementation so

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,360
that

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,360
has been what i've been mostly working

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,039
on the last month and a half

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,240
is um creating a whole

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,640
monaco mode um

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,720
i'm not sure what open sauce is open

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,360
sauce is my project

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,799
oh okay yeah sean is very familiar with

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,360
my project because i use one graph

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,240
for that as well um but yeah i would

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,159
love to have uh

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,640
a nice little data layer and uh

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,880
graphical embedded in my project

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,840
um that's not the area there yet i'm

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,640
working for 1.0 myself too as well

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,760
okay great yeah so yeah if you look at

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,880
the

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,480
pr there um you could even open a deploy

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,360
preview of it and see

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,720
yeah that it's we've got um that's an

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,080
older screenshot but

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,919
yeah it doesn't look yeah uh

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,919
and i think i need to yeah

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,519
yeah and then you'll have to go to slash

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,799
bundle

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,080
slash dis so i'm still figuring that out

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,279
too because before it would deploy

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,600
just straight to the root sub package oh

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,519
wow

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,960
like this is definitely looks different

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,399
than the uh the screenshots i've seen

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,760
before

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,799
yeah right yeah so these uh

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,279
this is with this is a rewrite

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
so a lot of the original componentry is

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,240
there but we've

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,600
we've moved them from function or from

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,880
class components to functional

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,399
components

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,159
we've created uh contexts for

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,320
um for managing the state and providing

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,600
handlers for a lot of the different

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,880
activities

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,279
um so um

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,320
so this is going to be the sort of step

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,240
back a little bit this is going to be

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,799
for 1.0 this um

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,679
this version this is all for 2.0 for 2.0

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,360
gotcha

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,519
yeah so once we release 1.0 stable

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,480
which is really just kind of the the end

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,399
cap for

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,320
all of the zero xy work um

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,320
um sorry i need to beat this

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,039
um so once we get to um

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,880
once we release 1.0 stable which should

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,600
happen this weekend probably

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,240
once once we fix a few more bugs i just

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
want to

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,360
have a very nice stable version because

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,399
we're going to be working on plug-ins

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,799
for a long time

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,760
yeah probably another few months of

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,799
building out plug-ins and presets and

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,840
and shoring up all that work um

00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,440
so um so as we do that

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,679
um we're gonna merge

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,000
so after we release 1.0 this will be

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,039
merged into master so master will look

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,240
like a prettier version of this we still

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
have to do the sidebar

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
we're going to have a vs code style

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,360
sidebar we still got to add the resizer

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,480
we have a resizer component we haven't

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,080
added it

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,080
and we still got to figure out uh

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
multi-step or

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,600
multi-session tabs or like a

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,360
multi-session mode where you could have

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,679
multiple tabs or

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,519
you could have multiple instances of

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,159
graphical with different sessions on the

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,159
same page like in an mdx document

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,799
or something which by the way i work at

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,519
gatsby gatsby's been paying me since

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,240
january full time to work on this nice

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,240
uh

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,720
or actually i'm sorry february so as of

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
february earth like february 9th

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,399
is my first time working full-time paid

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,679
on this up until then

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,720
i was working a whole lot like

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,760
a lot on uh projects at hilton so that's

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
why things didn't go as fast as quickly

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,559
as i'd hoped last year

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,240
um in fact at hilton they didn't even

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
have me working on graphql which was

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,520
disappointing

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,200
but we used graphical there huge

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,679
implementation used by

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,119
hundreds if not thousands of developers

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,320
unfortunately

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,839
for for their sake um because of code

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,679
a lot of them have been laid off so if

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,040
anyone wants to hire some great

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,079
typescript react graphql developers just

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,639
knock on just find people from hilton um

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,679
i can

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,240
offer recommendations but um great

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,720
people

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,800
really smart but yeah but yeah so so i

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,839
got to move into doing this full time

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,960
and um and that's been really great and

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,320
part of that like

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,720
a lot of the the most needed features

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,399
um by gatsby are also the most needed

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,760
features by almost everyone else who

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,560
uses graphic

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,040
um oh thanks for saying the new ui's

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,399
dope

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,399
are you talking oh wait you're talking

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,359
about the getup

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,079
might be something yeah no i i was i'd

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,000
be like are you sure

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,440
no it'll be great so orchard did a

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,680
really great job of

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,680
providing a redesign now you're fine

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,400
orta did a great job of redesigning

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,800
uh coming up with a new light skin for

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,720
graphical it's kind of based on

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,720
some of the relay semantics and stuff

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,920
like that so we're adapting that

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,720
we hope to have a dark mode too so

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
if any designers want to keep building

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,960
on his sketch files

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,359
they totally can yeah and for context

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,839
this is the older version

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,359
yeah so it still has even like the bezel

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,560
look too as well from that

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,040
that time that time yeah the

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,480
good old what was that is that what 2.0

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,560
i'm losing track anymore

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,960
uh it's a 2.2.2 yeah about 2.2

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,920
yeah i remember the bezel look yeah oh

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,240
yeah get that

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
that version i want to take a quick

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,520
break at this uh call out

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,880
crazy max who shows up in a lot of these

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,800
github streams as well

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,839
uh i assume you're talking to my chair

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
because i think ricky is actually

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,200
standing

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,400
uh my chair is a gaming chair from

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,400
amazon

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,240
so if you google or sorry if you search

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
gaming chair and like pick the first one

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
that's the one

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
i have no idea what it's called or the

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,240
brand

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,599
i could stand up and look at it but i'm

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,040
not sure how much value you'll get out

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,480
of that but yeah i literally

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,520
github does give us a uh github is 80

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,440
remote like we're 100 remote right now

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,359
um but they give us a stipend for your

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,680
your desk so i get this cool

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,720
chair the desk that you can't see and

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
this cool green screen

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,839
as well in the background if you did not

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,839
catch that is a green screen

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,880
oh gosh excellent so i i wanted to shift

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,560
gear i did pull up the uh

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
if not i don't know if a lot of people

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
know about this but if you want to slash

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,680
contribute to any github repo

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,880
you can actually um you can get like

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,720
good first issues

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,200
as well as some documentation stuff like

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,880
that so this is built on

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,720
it only works for open source repos as

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,560
well but it's built on a little bit of

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,079
machine learning and understanding like

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
what is a good first issue

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,000
and if there's a blog post about this as

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,760
well um so i'm curious if any of these

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,839
things are good first issues

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,240
and also i'm going to mention i do have

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,680
a mx keyboard too i have a machine uh

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,960
sorry a mechanical keyboard that's what

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,960
you hear clicking as i'm typing

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,480
yeah um the first one's already been

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,280
resolved resolved

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,000
um yeah what was can you explain what

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,079
the um

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,520
can you explain what this is we just had

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,160
to reintroduce the

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
the type doc deployed we'd removed it

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,320
from the net lo fi

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,359
deploy because it was blocking our pr's

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,880
and it was just a dependency issue that

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,880
i didn't have time to solve at the time

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
so we removed it temporarily to get some

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,520
work through

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,480
yeah and then i reintroduced it and we

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,520
wanted to create a separate netlify job

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,520
to do it but the type doc

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,760
i don't know what they did but it's way

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,119
faster now for mono repos

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,119
yeah um and maybe it was just some

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,839
configuration tweaks that worked out

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,920
so now it takes like 10 seconds so it

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,200
wasn't necessary to create a separate

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,119
network by job

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,440
yeah and it looks like the uh the only

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,960
change was added reading this um

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,680
action workflow yeah and so

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,720
adding you know breaking out our um our

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,359
netlify

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,960
job into separate actions would be a

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,160
cool thing eventually because we've

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,119
gotten to the

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,599
i it's very easy for us to hit the the

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,720
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,920
the 15 minute timeout ceiling on netlify

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,960
now because

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,800
as you can see the example repos um

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,920
we use them to validate on nci

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,880
different uh types of implementations so

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,040
it allows us to validate that consuming

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,599
uh web pack projects work with

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,280
uh graphical and code mirror here or

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,400
with the monaco mode

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,440
yeah as well so um we run those all

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,040
in netlify as a way to kind of validate

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
the build and making sure that we don't

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,560
have any breaking changes to how we're

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,839
exporting modules

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,480
yeah how um

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,079
how our webpack config for the graphical

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
cdn bundles

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,400
is on and the graphical cdn bundle i

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,000
know some javascript developers are

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,800
probably rolling their eyes at the idea

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,599
of like

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
using a script tag to import a library

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
but

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,480
500 000 hits a month

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,240
on js deliver is no joke so we make that

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,240
a first class interface

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,599
even though javascript developers

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,000
probably don't think of those kinds of

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,079
interfaces as being first class

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,280
yeah i actually have a uh use that are

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,680
people who don't want to mess with jobs

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,599
i do have a script tag uh that i'm using

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,000
for my my bay bot so i stream on twitch

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,040
as well

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,760
on my bw channel and uh this

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,520
baybot the way i get my bot to run is

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,839
actually through a script tag

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,880
uh it's a project hosted in the github

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,079
pages so

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,119
uh i think most people are familiar with

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,960
github pages uh but this is a script tag

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,520
and this is how beyonce shows up on my

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,000
streams i do have some dead code here so

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,680
please

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,839
excuse that i thought i deleted it but

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,480
it's still there so that doesn't

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,440
don't mind that but this is uh the work

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,880
that actually

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,839
plays the horn and then uh shows my gif

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,319
uh feel free to fork that star that i do

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,960
want to

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,240
build a tutorial around how i built that

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,359
because i'm a big fan but

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,960
you mentioned js deliver as well um it's

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,440
the way to get a super easy twitch

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,480
plug-in

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,640
or twitch bot uh working is this a quick

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,520
index.html so sorry to digress but

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,520
that's really cool

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,119
yeah i know you could do that yeah it

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,480
was a lot of fun and uh it was a lot of

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,319
work uh thanks for uh

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,079
insta fluff who's also who's who just

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,599
finished actually his stream

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,760
and then the coding garden as well who

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,160
does a lot of these examples that i sort

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,200
of

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,200
just picked from

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,839
but uh going back to the uh examples uh

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,560
i'm curious how do you keep those in

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,560
sync

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,240
because you're you're now you're doing

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,079
1.0 2.0

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,000
and then i even saw like some 3.0 on

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
some other some other milestones

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
like how do you keep these projects

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,800
these example folders in sync

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,000
with the new versions uh good question

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,400
so um so cdn

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,040
always references the latest build from

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,200
um i think

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,119
unpackaged now but we can do the same

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,359
with js deliver they both allow you to

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,280
just point to the latest version so that

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,040
is relatively easy to maintain with the

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
webpack one it's always

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,880
helpful because if there is an issue

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,310
it's because of something we're doing

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,400
so the graphical webpack

00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,680
[Music]

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,240
one has a cra style

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,440
config it doesn't use cra we have a new

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:52,640
cra one actually now that a user added

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,680
for us but um but um

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,680
it's it's enough of a it's it's a

00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,800
we consider it a good testing config

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,920
because

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,520
um it gives us a reference point too to

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,319
show users how to configure it for

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,240
webpack

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,680
because there's a couple nuances the

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,119
code mirror

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,960
um and code mirror um graphql and stuff

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,440
uh but yeah we keep them in i keep it

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,440
minimal i'm gonna add an electron one

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,319
too and i show how to load a schema from

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,240
a file

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,520
instead of doing http using our new

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,599
monaco mode nice

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,560
um and you mentioned monaco mode a

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,720
couple times

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,480
uh do you mind yes like could we go into

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,880
that a little bit

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,480
please let's do that yeah that's that's

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,079
an exciting thing so how do i

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,000
how do i where where's the first place i

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,240
look to find this uh this monika mode

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,720
and

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,839
where you can start explaining it so be

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,599
in packages

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,040
monaco graphql excellent and um

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,040
this would be a great time to bust out

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,160
that diagram too so before we

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,119
dive too too deeply into monaco graphql

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,680
do you have that that diagram i sent uh

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,960
yes

00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,160
you did send that and i did not

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,760
prepare that did you put it on twitter

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,760
uh or was it on the the dock

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,599
let me just see if i can

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,079
um yeah because i'm not seeing a link uh

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,839
either on twitter or on uh oh

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,599
i think i just posted it straight to

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,720
discord and tagged you

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,119
oh okay i would do that um

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,319
no worries i i'll open up discord but uh

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,920
feel free to start uh

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,760
talking about it and then i'll i'll pull

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,400
it up while you're talking

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,680
okay yeah and i'll just drop it in the

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,880
chat where everyone is

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,480
too oh perfect even better yeah

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,000
a link here actually i'll just grab it

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,119
from the chat because i don't want

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,680
discord to start

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,839
squawking at me or notifications

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,040
oh shoot i'm not logged into twitch so i

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:55,040
can watch the chat

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,920
but i can't here all right you

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,319
over zoom sorry no worries hey this is

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,720
how

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,640
this is live production yeah

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,960
i'm i'm reading the chat just so

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,800
everyone knows i just i i guess i forgot

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,560
to log in

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
don't worry so i got this diagram here

00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,000
and i'll get our heads out of the way

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:18,240
too as well

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,240
yeah yeah yeah so

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,800
yeah so this is where we're at now

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,920
actually for the most part so with

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,480
especially with that rewrite pr um

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,480
and once that gets merged to master um

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:39,520
it uh yeah it's

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:43,680
so basically these purple um or violet

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,200
um uh

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,800
i i want to call them nodes i'll just

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,040
call them those are

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
our our third-party dependencies so

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,079
these might be

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,920
projects that people are familiar with

00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,280
there's a

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,560
graphql explorer that sean has created

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,280
here

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,920
and other and his partner onegraph or

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,680
graphical plugins

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
is something that will implement

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,440
graphical we got

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,640
um the the playground graphical

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,160
playground

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,760
um um implements

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,280
uh this ecosystem altair is a desktop

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,520
graphql client

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,400
uh insomnia there's a bunch of others

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,079
that implement

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,319
either graphical or others github

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,760
documentation explorer would be another

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,960
purple node on here

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,359
and then the blue ones are all uh inside

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,000
this mono repo oh i forgot to add a

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,760
thing there

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,040
um so the blue ones all um

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,200
you know are representing

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,800
interdependencies so the most important

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,560
thing to know is it's graphql language

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,040
servers it's an lsp

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,079
service in the kind of new microsoft

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,599
language server protocol

00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,880
kind of pattern that implements these

00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,160
three packages

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,480
so i created this special glue package

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,040
graphical language service to

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
to bring it all together in a way that

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,960
makes sense to people who are used to

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,920
doing bs code and

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,880
lsp style language service development

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,880
so that

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,880
so graphql language service is meant to

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,640
be runtime agnostic

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,240
so we currently have it running with

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,760
monaco graphql we actually have it

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,040
running in a web worker

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,240
okay um and then in graphcode language

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,359
service server

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,760
we have it running being

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,400
spawned as sub processes as a language

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,240
server process off of the

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,160
vs code graphql extension process

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,319
there's a couple other vs code

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,920
extensions that use our language server

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:49,839
and where

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:52,560
hopefully it would be cool once

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,119
graphical plugins are are you know

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,599
stable

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,319
the plugin api stable and all that's

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,119
going

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,560
we might adopt vs code graphql

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,599
eventually

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,880
from prisma and deviant using

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,200
to to bring a full

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,400
reference implementation under the hood

00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,640
because

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,560
you know when people see the graphical

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,000
mono repo they usually think oh

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,599
all this has to do with just getting

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,920
graphical working but

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,079
the same tooling can be used to build vs

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,200
code extensions and that's what this

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,880
this uh diagram is meant to explain okay

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,839
so monaco graphql

00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,760
is replacing codemir graphql in our de

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,839
facto graphical implementation

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,440
this doesn't mean that it's being cast

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,079
aside we're definitely

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,640
going to maintain it for at least a year

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,200
after

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:45,839
graphical um goes stable with monaco

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,599
so and we're still maintaining it but

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,839
the monaco graphql

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,640
library that i just published for the

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,240
first time a couple of weeks ago

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,839
and we're starting to get more versions

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,280
out is a

00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:01,200
is a web implementation using the monaco

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,079
editor library which is what's used

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,079
in vs code

00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,960
to render uh graphql

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,680
um in a more lsp

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,520
centered kind of uh language ecosystem

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,079
yeah can you explain that a bit the vs

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,480
code

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,559
you reference the vs code graphql um

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,240
uh is that like the is that the north

00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,760
star of what we're trying to accomplish

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,000
here with graphical or

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,520
um how do i how do i bring that up and

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,280
then how do i um

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,280
how do i sort of fit that in this

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,720
ecosystem could you had mentioned prisma

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,160
perhaps owns it yeah fresno owns the vs

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,880
code graphql it's the second most

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,400
popular

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,160
graphql language extension in bs on vs

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,520
code so if you go look for

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,520
research in vs code

00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,599
extensions and you just type the word

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,119
graphql you'll see a different a few

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,359
different ones come up

00:48:53,119 --> 00:49:01,200
um yeah this one so this one has a hot

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:04,079
you know almost 200 000 installs

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,960
it has schema driven completion using

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,960
graphql

00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,480
config and there's all these really

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,720
powerful features

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:16,079
um that really allow users to

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,359
to build and extend schemas and

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,559
to write queries so it works now

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,960
not only before it worked with just um

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,640
embedded graphql and gql tags in

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,200
javascript but now with typescript as

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,839
well

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,839
okay so um so you can do

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,960
um so you can do um graphql

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,240
language completion core schemas and

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,280
in query tag like gql tags or other

00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,520
i forgot the one that relay uses and we

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,839
have one user who is actually working to

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,000
get it all working with reason as well

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,599
um the issue that we start running into

00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,040
when you deal with embedded languages

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,599
is parsing yeah so um

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,440
you can't just like say oh i'm just

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,240
gonna parse any language he wrote this

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,359
really great

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,359
uh regex implementation

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,640
um that was meant to be able to allow

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,000
people just add a few regular

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,800
expressions

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,920
um to parse their language for graphql

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,520
tags and

00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,520
we didn't quite get to that and

00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,599
eventually the monaco mode will support

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,000
all of the same features as well

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,359
um and it's cool because the same

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,960
underlying

00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,079
um functions that are in code mirror

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
graphql

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,599
that are in monaco graphql and that are

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:38,640
in the vs code language server

00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,640
are the graphql language server

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,079
are all using the same underlying

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,440
language code

00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,079
so you can think of them all as

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,079
different service interfaces so the same

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,079
so mostly the same business logic yeah

00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,800
sean's asking in the the chat who who's

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,559
doing the reason

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,079
ml uh word yeah tth okay yes

00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,079
yeah and he was doing a great job of

00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,079
that we ended up uh just

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,160
we realized that we could just enable we

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,680
already had an implementation with babel

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,000
parser

00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,880
for parsing the files and we realized

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,200
that we could just

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,440
turn on typescript parsing for that so

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,400
that was like an easy win for us to

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
enable

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,839
typescript but we would like to revisit

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,599
his work

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,800
on for parsing using regular expressions

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,520
but it's again

00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,319
the the vs code extension side of this

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,680
stuff

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,839
i would love to be able to spend more

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,880
time on but it's just not my

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,559
primary uh responsibility right now but

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,400
it's a great example of something where

00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,000
if someone wants to like

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,680
dig in on graphql and you know over a

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,359
period of time and help out

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,599
that would be a great ecosystem to

00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,440
continue to bolster as well yeah and it

00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,319
looks like the um

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,280
prisma has this open source as well so

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,400
yes

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,880
the beauty of open source yes

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,440
yeah it's great so yeah divi understand

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,599
is the primary maintainer for this

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,599
um this is one of the re i tweeted

00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,839
recently just a list of repos that i

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,000
helped maintain including this one

00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,280
that could use more maintenance and

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,440
contributor

00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,400
help and this is one of them uh divi

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,520
undue loves this

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:18,960
repo but you just at prisma

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,160
they're they're um

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,880
priorities have changed a bit um so

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,480
they still maintain it a bit but he

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,440
doesn't get to put nearly as much time

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,520
as he wants to

00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,000
into it so he mostly does it in his free

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,720
time now which doesn't have much of

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,520
he's a family guy but brilliant work

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,760
he's done here

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,800
we were hoping to eventually bring that

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,240
into the monomer

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:44,480
as well so excellent but we have there's

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,200
no formal decisions about that

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,319
um and you know it could remain this way

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,440
so we'll see

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,760
um but yeah so um so monaco graphql is

00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,520
basically a web implementation of that

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,960
and i like to do a conference talk about

00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,440
this eventually because it's really cool

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,319
so

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,640
the cool thing about monaco graphql and

00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,559
implementing a language service

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,760
server for for vs code or other

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:10,480
languages uh for other ids

00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,559
with lsp is that lsp has kind of the

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,119
same

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,880
architectural pattern across different

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,119
runtimes and implementations

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,920
so whether you're implementing a web ide

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,599
or

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,720
a desktop ide plug-in

00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,599
it's the same kind of concept where you

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,640
have a

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,400
client that spawns processes that

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,599
process the language for you

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,960
so it's a it's a it

00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,680
relies on parallel processing

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,599
of data and um you know kind of

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,880
horizontally scaling

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,160
your language tooling um to make it as

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,160
fast as possible

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,680
yeah so one of the fun and exciting and

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,880
challenging parts about developing

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,480
language tooling

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,079
is almost every event that you're

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,119
handling is very

00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,800
rapid fire it's very

00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:06,000
so every little thing you do is

00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:08,960
that blocks further

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,760
language service messages can be an

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,160
issue so

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,000
that's why monaco graphql um

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,440
adopted this pattern where all the

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,640
language

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:23,680
service processing

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,760
like parsing or processing

00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,240
ast or generating completion items or

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,800
generating a list of diagnostic

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,680
messages that we call like linting or

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,880
whatever

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,440
that stuff um is all being done in a web

00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,200
worker and then gets sent over

00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,720
you know through that boundary layer

00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,920
back to the main process

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,480
and just like hey we've already

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,280
processed this for you so

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,480
as we continue to design build out this

00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,359
monaco graphql

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,280
service we're trying to focus as much as

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,720
possible on that and even to expose

00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,400
interfaces so that when people are

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,880
developing plug-ins

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,240
they can just say hey web worker parse

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,240
this

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,680
and get it back they don't have to

00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,720
implement a web worker

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,880
they don't have to wire any of that up

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,079
they just call an api method that just

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,559
so happens to be invoking the web worker

00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,240
and so we have a lot of the api

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,280
interface for monaco graphql will be

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,480
that way

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,160
and then we'll expose that to graphql to

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,720
graphical plugins

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,000
to the plugin api yeah um in the plugin

00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,000
api you'll get

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,520
you'll be able to use the monaco editor

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,839
instance directly which

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,520
is the monaco editor api if you look at

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,160
the the type dock for it

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,200
it's just incredible the kinds of things

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,119
you can implement

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,799
we have a command palette if you wanted

00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:45,599
to show the demo i could

00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:47,280
um yeah you could how do i navigate to

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,440
that isn't that read me

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,960
oh you had it right there well the the

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,520
half finished uh

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,640
oh yeah yeah the um i wonder if i still

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,000
have that

00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:01,040
open the deploy preview

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,920
um there's a there's a vanilla

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,839
js implementation on netlify too if you

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,720
wanted to

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:13,040
uh on netlify the oh wait this is the

00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,960
sorry this is not the right one i had

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,240
the pr open

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:21,359
earlier and i must have backed out of it

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,400
ah it's okay um which is the

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:27,280
oh it's the rsc rfc pr right

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,359
yeah 15 23. there we go we'll get there

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,119
no you're a maintainer when you start

00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,119
memorizing some of the important pr

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,720
numbers yes

00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,640
also you know how long those pr's have

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,599
been open if you can remember it yeah

00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,599
yeah it's it's been open we've been in

00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,640
the midst of this uh in bundle slash

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,079
dist

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,680
yeah we've been in the midst of this

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,400
rewrite since december

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,880
actually um and it's been great we've

00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:53,599
had six or seven different contributors

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,599
and yeah it's been fabulous so um yeah

00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,839
you can start writing a graphql query

00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,000
there

00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:03,680
um so and so this is the monaco mode

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,359
yeah nice um so this is

00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,359
the other one is with code mirror this

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:10,799
one is with monica gotcha so

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,359
um so you could do all films start with

00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,200
a uh

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,040
yeah there you go there we go yeah i was

00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,040
wondering it doesn't have all the same

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,799
conv convenience features of code mirror

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,640
graphql yet it's a little rough

00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,079
okay yeah um so do i have to do like

00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,839
first

00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,079
uh you don't have to do any arguments

00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,520
you could um it should be completing for

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,720
that if there are any

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,280
i don't think it sees any though um oh

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,440
yeah and then

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,319
there is a first okay well i can at

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,680
least do it it's like a relay style

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:43,359
yeah um and also uh

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:46,559
you could do uh start typing films

00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:50,880
um yeah okay

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:53,680
and then that expands to like id

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,440
you can just do brackets and then id

00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,880
yeah

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,200
oh just like that yeah let's get in the

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,559
right

00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,400
there's a little bug with the completion

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,240
it looks like a little bit yeah

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,400
it seems like we need we need some other

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,880
contributors in this uh

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,400
this project yeah it's all right we got

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,319
we got something yeah

00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,079
so is there like a name or a title there

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:16,000
we go title yeah

00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,920
yeah so the way it works now is you have

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,640
to start typing like the first two

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,040
characters

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,960
to start getting completion yeah um so

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,200
that's one thing we're gonna tune

00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,480
right now we're still so we've been

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,280
collaborating with the

00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,000
the vs code and monaco editor team on

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,440
this

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
uh and this is probably one of the most

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,119
advanced modes they've had to implement

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,960
because it's dynamically schema driven

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,400
which means you can reload the schema

00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,400
and it can change

00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,599
um some of the other ones like monaco

00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,520
json

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,760
uh you're from you're probably familiar

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,440
with the the json and monaco

00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,720
implementation whenever you're

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,319
typing out a package json or a ts config

00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,839
yeah that's when you're you're seeing

00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,520
that kind of stuff so

00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,599
same team that developed that stuff for

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,000
helping you know i've been working with

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,520
uh

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,240
peng liu from the vs code team and he's

00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,040
rebornics on github he's been super

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,160
helpful

00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,160
um just uh he jumps in every every

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,079
couple weeks to just give the thumbs up

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,440
on things i'm doing but at one point we

00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,960
did pair program on some of these

00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,520
language features but

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,680
um but yeah so uh and now if you

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,960
right-click on the query editor

00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,520
you can see we have all these really

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,720
cool oh there's a type

00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:33,040
um so uh but if you just right click

00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,400
anywhere to get the context menu yeah

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:38,240
okay then we get

00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:41,040
run operation or format document so

00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,920
yeah i think my format is good but yeah

00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,880
i could run it from here

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,359
that formatter uses prettier which is

00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,119
something

00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,280
that's been in demand for a long time in

00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,240
graphical right now we just have this

00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,520
kind of a hack

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:55,200
of a pretty uh predefication formatting

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,200
function that's actually just like 10

00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,240
lines long

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,119
that kind of works like uh

01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,480
json to serialization json stringify a

01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,160
bit where it just like

01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,520
adds a bunch of stuff that makes it look

01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,799
formatted but now

01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,640
we have the formatter and when you

01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,599
implement monaco graphql you get a

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,799
method

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,960
for um changing the formatting options

01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:20,880
using the printer config so

01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,839
all we would have to do is add a

01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,119
menu here to change your prettier config

01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,760
options and you could and you could

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,280
switch

01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,200
from tabs to spaces yes it does sean

01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,040
yes that's one of the main reasons i

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,559
implemented it for prettier does it keep

01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,880
comments while prettying

01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,400
yes and that's yeah that's that's yeah

01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,599
one of the main reasons why we added

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,079
that printer

01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,040
has a graphical parser that's done a

01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,640
great job of

01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,319
taking care of a lot of these things for

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,640
us so instead of

01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,880
you know doing it ourselves we just

01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,520
offloaded it to them yeah sean's a fan

01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,079
and yeah so the users will be able to

01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,240
configure tabs or spaces or

01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,400
or other formatting options using the

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,920
graphql parser and then

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,440
you know we might add a few of our own

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,680
options ourselves so

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,760
another cool feature that just comes for

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,799
free at monica as you can see

01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,319
is uh oh what the heck the mini map uh

01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,480
on the right hand side

01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,319
so you'll notice if you have an error

01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,119
just like in vs code

01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,559
um like if you just uh you could change

01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,839
title to turtle that's one of my

01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,920
favorite ones to do

01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:27,920
oh uh common mistype yeah there you go

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,599
so this is now you can see it in the

01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,319
mini map

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,599
yeah if you if you scroll up you can see

01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:36,240
it in there too

01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,880
it's better it's easier on larger

01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,920
queries

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,040
oh yeah i am uh stuck in the

01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,480
mode oh yeah there we go

01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,079
uh so you're talking about this kind of

01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,839
small there yeah

01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,160
it's it's bigger when you have like a

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:53,680
bigger chunk of it you can see more

01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,720
um but you can you get more of that and

01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,079
then also if you click

01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:01,039
f1 let me see if i can yeah there we go

01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,079
really break this thing wait what i

01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,920
think you broke it

01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,720
you broke the parser with the semicolon

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,319
uh semicolon i gotta fix it

01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,599
all right i'm glad the q a this for you

01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,680
there you go okay now we get to release

01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,000
it to red

01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,599
there you are yeah monaco graphql is

01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,200
still on its first version

01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,720
so it's pretty new um there's a lot of

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,559
work that needs to be done

01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,720
and it's it's hard to juggle both that

01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,400
and in the plug-in api which could be

01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,160
developed concurrently

01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,599
but it's just um

01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,440
it's just been really difficult to

01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,079
illustrate all of those concepts of

01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,799
people because

01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,559
there's so much for knowledge and

01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,799
because every time i create issues to

01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,359
summarize the work that needs to be done

01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:45,920
things change and i have to delete like

01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,680
10 or 12 issues or rewrite them all

01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,680
and so it's been really hard it's not

01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,400
it's not exactly in a state for good

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,440
first-time

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,079
issues to be abundant it's this is more

01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,839
of a

01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,440
hey i want to help re-architect this

01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,520
project i want to

01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,760
like right now the call's been open for

01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,799
a couple of months now that we this is

01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,280
especially

01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:06,960
so we just got the monaco mode working

01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,319
in the rewrite

01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:14,559
uh feature branch about a month

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:16,799
ago or so so since then it's been

01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,839
open field if anyone wants to submit a

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,280
plug-in

01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,599
uh api proposal they can i have an idea

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,520
of

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,039
how i want to do it but if someone else

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,200
wants to they can

01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,039
um we've mentioned that on some working

01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,000
group calls and on twitter and other

01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,720
places trying to

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,440
call for that but i don't think uh

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,200
anyone

01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,720
is ready to just be like hey i'm going

01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,039
to create this huge vr to

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,000
suggest one way we could do plugins yeah

01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,680
we'll get there so

01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,119
um one other feature i wanted to show in

01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,520
that demo real quick

01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:50,240
okay is uh if you hit f1

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,400
then you get the command palette uh i

01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,000
don't have f1 on this uh 65 percent

01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,799
keyboard

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,160
i uh it's okay oh wait if you do right

01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,440
click again well first of all you got to

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,359
delete the semicolon

01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,559
yeah that's just an issue that's my bad

01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,960
uh i don't have

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,880
error handling put in for the graphql

01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,599
parser yet yeah and my bet on having

01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,480
this uh

01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,039
fancy mechanical keyboard with my golden

01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,720
button

01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,280
i can't show my uh the cable is routed

01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
around

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,039
but yeah say it again command palette

01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,440
there we go yeah

01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,440
so in here you can type in commands just

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,960
like in vs code and users will be able

01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,559
to

01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:31,599
contribute um you know

01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,319
plugins that add different commands and

01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,319
things like that

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,400
um so you can just type here like run

01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,319
operation nice and you could do that to

01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,680
run the operation so that's

01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,160
like one of our basic examples we got a

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,799
lot more

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,960
oh man um could you yes would you be

01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,799
able to re-route this uh command because

01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,520
like f1 is something i'm missing on my

01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,039
keyboard

01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,720
i'm sure it works if i hit like the

01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,640
function key at something else but can i

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,599
do like spacebar

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,599
and or spacebar and my command is first

01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,160
need to be like command spacebar command

01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,799
spacebar

01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,079
even better yeah yeah because users need

01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:11,599
to use a spacebar

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:14,240
yeah that is true for spacebar

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,280
and bam i use things and them my my mind

01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,559
goes spacebar

01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,960
to another command that's uh

01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,079
in when you're outside of insert mode

01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,000
yeah

01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,640
yeah i know a little bit i don't know

01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,400
them to be to exit make a lot of trouble

01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,280
yeah yeah and i can delete lines

01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,240
and replace stuff i can use i would say

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,000
that uh

01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:38,480
if anybody's interested in them i

01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,960
actually mentioned this on my stream but

01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,319
uh

01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:44,640
oh vim vim adventures excellent

01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:46,160
game to stream while you're doing twitch

01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,960
twitch streams oh yeah

01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,400
so if you want to actually learn how to

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,440
exit vim

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,119
there you go but

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,400
we won't spend all our time doing that

01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,680
actually so we're at the top of the hour

01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,280
and i i think um

01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,880
i scheduled like the time to go at least

01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,319
for another 30 minutes so

01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,000
if you don't have a hard stop i'd love

01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,760
to talk about

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,599
the the language parser too as well

01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,319
because you alluded that a couple times

01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,359
if there's a to sort of see how the code

01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,960
that that works

01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,520
and then if there's any way that people

01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,720
can jump in i point i pointed us to

01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,720
discussions earlier while we were

01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,799
talking when you were talking about

01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,640
plugins uh i know you just recently got

01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,760
discussions enabled on your your repo

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,200
because i think last week there was

01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,680
nothing no discussions

01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,799
and this week we do have discussions so

01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,319
i don't know if that's a good place for

01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:33,359
people to go to or if you rather

01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,559
stuff being issues i think i think what

01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,160
i found out is

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,599
i didn't realize totally what

01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,240
discussions were so i took

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,640
every issue that was labeled discussion

01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,200
and

01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:45,200
started migrating it without realizing

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,599
the repercussions so i think

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,240
discussions i'd like to direct users to

01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,839
if they

01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,599
are trying to solve a problem in

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,960
graphical and need the best answer

01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,839
like hey what's the best way to

01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,400
um implement auth with graphical yeah

01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,720
right and

01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,640
a bunch of users will chime in with

01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,400
their different ways of doing it

01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,160
it's all possible it's always been

01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,319
possible um

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,000
but the best way to do it is probably

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,760
something that users can kind of figure

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,520
out themselves you know i think that's

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,880
it seems like that's what discussions

01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,520
are geared towards

01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,200
kind of being like you know a quora or a

01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,039
or a stack overflow

01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,880
yeah and the the best part is that you

01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,880
can mark answers

01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,240
so i do have an example so actually

01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,559
alluding to

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,640
sean mentioning open source uh this is a

01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,720
project that i built on top of graphql

01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:34,160
uh github's graphql api i do have a

01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,280
discussion why marked

01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,920
as an answer that i can show so we

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,960
wanted a

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,160
beautiful 404 page um so i didn't i

01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,839
don't have as many users

01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,599
uh and most of the people who contribute

01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:48,079
are the ones that are doing discussions

01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,440
but i noticed that i had a 404 a missing

01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,880
404 page

01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,039
so i created a nice little cool pizza

01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,480
and uh marked this as the answer so if

01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,720
you want to see what the final version

01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,960
is

01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,400
it lives here um nice in this drop box

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,920
that i didn't even think of that one

01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,960
that wouldn't that that's another good

01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,200
purpose for it

01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:12,400
yeah and just okay yeah zeit um

01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,599
let's see so tim he was on

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,119
he was chatting through and they've

01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,359
actually got early access to discussions

01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,480
before most people including myself

01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,199
uh but they have like nice little cool

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,719
like pen links as well which is not

01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,000
enabled so i'm showing this off right

01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,359
now and everybody's probably gonna be

01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,960
like oh man this would be great

01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,279
but um they have some extra extra

01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,440
features enabled but you can see

01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,719
some of the winners uh the most answers

01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,759
answerers i'm not sure if that's the

01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,040
proper

01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,000
distinction individuals ask the most

01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,880
questions so

01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
i think at the moment open source has to

01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,920
build

01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,359
a reason for people to show up in here

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,000
and i think next has done a good job of

01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,960
like

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,040
forcing the not forcing but putting the

01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,799
questions here for people to get answers

01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,880
and that way if i want to find out why

01:08:54,799 --> 01:09:00,159
css is not respecting my

01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,440
my ram and px stuff uh in chrome firefox

01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:03,040
and mobile whatever this is

01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,040
uh i can see that this has an answer

01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,679
someone knows stackoverflow

01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,719
that's a great yeah yeah we'll we'll

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,640
have a few of those

01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,400
there's a few common questions that

01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,239
people have so it'll be great to direct

01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,920
them to something whereas this i'm kind

01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:18,960
of it's almost like a

01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,120
spec or feature discussion yeah and

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,960
it's something where i'd expect there to

01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,880
be a lot of deliberation and

01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,480
there's not going to be a right answer

01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,239
there's going to just be an ongoing

01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,199
discussion yeah so i think the

01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:31,839
the thought of doing rfcs in this world

01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:34,319
as well

01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,679
uh makes a lot of sense as well so like

01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,440
maybe rfc

01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,880
maybe your how to do uh plug-in

01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,319
architecture um

01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,239
goes in the discussion it doesn't have

01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,159
to be marked as an answer but the fact

01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:45,759
that that lives here and not in a

01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,080
and it's actually threaded too so i can

01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,319
actually write a comment here

01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,279
and it's attached to this thread um so

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,799
that way you think

01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,320
questions are not lost but then you're

01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,920
also not getting pinged

01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:57,440
like 10 times a night with people saying

01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,239
no this is the absolute wrong way for

01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,440
you to do it

01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,239
please delete this issue um rather it

01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,440
could just be a

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,800
discussion yeah that's good because we

01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,440
actually end up a lot of these

01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,360
discussions

01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,679
end up happening in our general discord

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,080
channel which is which is great because

01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,520
at least it's it's it's captured but it

01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,320
would be good to have more of these

01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,520
discussions

01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,199
and and github issues it's oftentimes

01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,320
people will ask about how does the

01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,280
plugin work how

01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,040
how will this be solved and i'll just

01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,280
just post some example

01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,520
of what it should be but we need a more

01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,840
formal rfc process going

01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,360
and that was my goal once the monaco

01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,360
graphql mode

01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,719
um was more stable but there's still a

01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,280
lot of work to do there

01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,040
so yeah and about that you know i was

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,560
going to say

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,600
like there's so much i want to ask about

01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,800
this project but i don't think we have

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,280
time for all of it

01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,800
like even if if someone was able to

01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,920
maybe yourself or someone else was able

01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,480
to write up

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,360
um so i've i'm sorry i'm being like

01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,640
selfishly

01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,360
saying what i would love it out of this

01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,679
project but even things like this

01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,880
and like a like the equivalent of a blog

01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,560
post and a discussion

01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,239
explaining the new architecture and how

01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,199
it's going to line up and then have

01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,199
people comment

01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,239
like that also can grant itself in this

01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:13,040
platform here as

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:14,640
or sorry this feature um so that way

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,040
when um so like

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,800
me and you connected because i actually

01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,360
um was trying to leverage

01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,480
uh doing the graphical project to do a

01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,080
contribution

01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,679
and i went through a couple issues found

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,960
good first issues and i was like oh this

01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,280
science seems right

01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,760
and then spent my time trying to figure

01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,239
out some old issues from like 2017.

01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,960
um oh yeah there you go and uh and

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,400
that's why

01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,840
this is where and actually i'm not even

01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,480
sure how much of correlation that you've

01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,040
actually

01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,800
connected in our conversation yet but

01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,480
from that issue i was able to discover

01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,080
hey there's something going on with the

01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,600
graphic graphical project

01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,360
and then i discovered okay this

01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,800
foundation absorbed it

01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,960
there's new stuff happening there's like

01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,880
a 1.0 and now a 2.0 release

01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,719
so then i was able to think oh okay so

01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,840
maybe these these older issues back from

01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,440
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,480
and 2017 are still valid today but maybe

01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,040
they're actually in limbo as the the

01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,000
long-standing pr's are yeah open i've

01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,679
spent so much

01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,679
time going through old issues and

01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:13,760
there's always just it always just seems

01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,120
like there's more i spent entire days

01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,080
going through them and it's just a

01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,840
rabbit hole

01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,760
and some of these so show inline field

01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,360
description and doc explored

01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:26,640
so um i think that one solved

01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,000
but we're also rewriting the whole doc

01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,280
explorer anyways

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,199
yeah probably so that's nice yeah

01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,800
it's kind of like and honestly i had

01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:36,000
someone tweet me uh that would be a

01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,159
great feature for github

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,679
or an action where you could block

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,239
issues

01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,920
dependent on other pr's or other issues

01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,120
so like this could be like

01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,560
and this is my thought and sorry i'm

01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,679
just like riffing because i have so much

01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,640
connection to github

01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,840
um but oh this is implemented then is it

01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,520
uh did you just see it

01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,520
yeah because they're suggesting that the

01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,239
inline comments look like that

01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,800
and yeah the inline descriptions gotcha

01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,480
so that's

01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,920
that's what we ended up yeah so this is

01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,280
one that should have been closed a while

01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,679
ago yeah

01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,679
i think cool well i'm just gonna say uh

01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,920
i i'm gonna add a contribution right now

01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,600
on

01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,679
air users are welcome to do this if

01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,560
anyone wants a good first issue it would

01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,600
be to go find an old issue from 2016 or

01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,320
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,000
and just ping me and say i think this is

01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,920
done right

01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,920
excellent i cannot wait to get that

01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,239
contribution i expect my name i

01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,120
expect my name to be on the board uh for

01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:32,239
contributing to

01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,880
graphical right oh yeah we thought about

01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,600
generating one of those little those uh

01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,120
grids of

01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,120
yeah so this is the new ui

01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,960
dang yeah so i know all contributors is

01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,120
a popular project that uh

01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,719
a lot of projects use but the benefit of

01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,679
now the new ui is that this actually

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,400
gets

01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,560
unearthed from a couple tabs to now be

01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,960
on the actual homepage which is awesome

01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,840
um we're also well i guess we don't have

01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,199
to go in a bunch of product feedback but

01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,640
uh there we are we are

01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,880
thinking about the way we think of

01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,440
contributors on github uh to be less

01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,199
about

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,280
green squares and more about did you

01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:12,000
answer a question in the discussions

01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,320
did you close an issue like those are

01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,760
all

01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,360
valid contributions that don't get

01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,080
collected that get collected

01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,560
in our database but aren't surface for

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,840
uh

01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,560
for our customers so like these are

01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,840
things that we're thinking through

01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,080
but this could be less about github and

01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,400
more about graphical but uh

01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,080
yeah so i mean we have roughly 15

01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,480
minutes anybody has questions that once

01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,960
you

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,920
have about graphical perhaps we can dig

01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,199
deeper

01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,360
i'm sure maybe i can start to deprod

01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:41,360
the team of getting some discussions

01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,800
open of exploiting some of this uh i get

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,840
the way the parser works like we can go

01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,640
through it now or we can just get a

01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:49,120
discussion going of how the parser works

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,400
um oh yeah we could that's a that's

01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,840
quite a deep discussion though

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,840
yeah i mean that would be it would be

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,840
fun to see the process and get like a

01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,120
brain dump

01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,880
um and like we don't have to do we don't

01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,199
have to all be on call to basically get

01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,760
that

01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,560
and like you have time to sort of like

01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,199
think through

01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,640
the process and hopefully that helps the

01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:07,920
maintainers of the project too as well

01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,920
by getting all the information out

01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,280
i've been trying to do it a lot myself

01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,880
and trying to

01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,320
get some of my dreams and aspirations i

01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,920
have a someone yourself

01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,440
prior to graphical i have a lot of small

01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,520
projects that

01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,239
don't even get 50 downloads on npm they

01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,679
get like one or two from me

01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:26,239
um yeah so um which i'm totally fine

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,920
with

01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,960
but i do have one project which is open

01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,840
source which does get a lot of

01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,320
contributions

01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,040
and a lot of conversation around it so

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,640
it's

01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,400
it's fun to have that discussion and

01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,719
sort of like push myself and like sort

01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,199
of

01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,159
grow my program programming muscle out

01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:45,040
in the open

01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:49,360
um so yeah big fan of learning in public

01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:52,640
yeah yeah it's it's great doing that i

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:54,560
i like doing streams with contributors

01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,560
that's something i do kind of informally

01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,040
there's a there's going to be a

01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,840
uh starting tomorrow i'm going to be

01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,640
doing

01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,239
a weekly session like just like office

01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,560
hours session two

01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:08,719
oh how do we find out how do we find the

01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,560
those office hours

01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,840
that's in working group folder i'm

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,640
pretty sure it's all up to date i might

01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,000
need to update it

01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:18,400
um there's a the readme there

01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,360
oh uh he summarizes and he has the

01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,159
minutes and everything too as well

01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,640
yeah it's inspired by the graphql-wg

01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,400
repo

01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,840
but we just kind of embedded it inside

01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,040
our mono repo

01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,040
it's a repo that does everything um

01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,960
you'll see sometimes in the commit log

01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,080
just a bunch of adding myself to the

01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,880
agenda

01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,080
commits which is goofy to see but hey

01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,159
we're making dudes

01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,920
hey those are green squares at the end

01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:46,960
of the day so yeah

01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,960
just kidding but really yeah

01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,199
so i need to add the next one for the

01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,400
next month um but yeah we

01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:56,080
we just and these oh i guess i didn't

01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,920
update with the minutes benji has some

01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:02,800
minutes

01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:04,480
um we had a lot of

01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,159
discussion and that one about the

01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,280
plug-in api

01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:12,640
uh sean was there um

01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,400

01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,640
people that are that were there

01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,080
that aren't listed um we have our google

01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,679
summer code

01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:23,199
uh in intern wait he's not on this one

01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,880
uh muhammad

01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:26,800
i think was on this call he just added

01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:30,640
himself to the agenda and then

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:34,000
hershey has been made um a

01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:37,040
a intern as well

01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,880
through what's it called community

01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,800
bridge which is linux foundation's like

01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,880
matching program so we have

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,960
two interns working on it they're doing

01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,640
great stuff i've got a couple pr's of

01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:51,199
review from them today

01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:53,840
um yeah mark down

01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,560
i should note at gatsby so gatsby not

01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,520
only

01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,679
belovingly maintains outside of their

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,719
org space they have me maintaining

01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,120
graphical

01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,000
but they also are maintaining the mdx

01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,360
project yep

01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:10,640
so if if we have any mdx fans here

01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:14,560
i mean gatsby isn't the sole reason but

01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:17,199
we we um in-house yeah

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,920
we help maintain the mdx website we're

01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:21,120
gonna help

01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,199
overhaul the graphql.org website uh it's

01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:27,440
part of the google summer docs program

01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:29,760
and partnership um funny enough

01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,480
the uh mdx came up in the last uh two

01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,400
streams

01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:34,239
four streams ago with uh tim from next

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,000
who i keep referring to

01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,679
um he brought it up as well so i

01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,520
actually chatted with chris buscardi

01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,560
actually for my podcast which is a whole

01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,840
nother link

01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,560
follow me on twitter when that actually

01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:47,040
gets published um but yeah we went we

01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,159
took a deep dive into uh mdx uh more in

01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,360
audio form than

01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:51,920
visually though yeah chris is great yeah

01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,159
and uh

01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,679
i work with uh john o'tander's on my

01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:59,040
team who's on the maintainers

01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:02,080
nice mdx as well yeah so yeah we've been

01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:05,120
we use it a ton at gatsby obviously

01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:08,560
so gatsby's all about mdx graphql

01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:12,800
we're also maintaining um the graphql

01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,320
php uh composer plugins and uh like

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,920
we're maintaining a lot of things that

01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,480
don't even have our name on it

01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,440
so that's one thing to note about uh

01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,719
gatsby

01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,719
is that we're actually

01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,920
kind of creating a team of people who

01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:31,600
work on because it's such a specific

01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:35,280
subset of of of gatsby where

01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,640
we're i rarely i've made my first pr to

01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,560
gatsby like

01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:43,840
earlier this week oh wow

01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,159
february yeah

01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,920
and and that's on purpose you know yeah

01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:49,199
that's on purpose because they want me

01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,480
focus on this

01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,320
there's been multiple times where i'm

01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,719
like hey i want to help i want to help

01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,920
with

01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:58,320
re i don't know wait

01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,280
i don't know what's public or not yeah i

01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,080
don't think it's i don't think it's

01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:02,320
public if you're

01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,679

01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,080
there's a couple products that are

um and lori who maintains the core

01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,920
like the default gatsby themes and stuff

like

01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,080

01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,960
people oh and oh my gosh i almost forgot

john gold of course yeah so it's like

01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:51,120
quite a little stuff

01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,400
i didn't realize john was uh at gatsby

01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,800
as well

01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,840
yeah yeah yeah we're all all at it

01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,440
there's a few

01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,520
quite a few people there that are just

01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,280
like wow there's there's people where i

01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,719
i didn't even realize they were on my

01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,000
team i just seen them on twitter i

01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,960
didn't realize they were at gatsby

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,960
already yeah

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,159
uh like nat and i'm like oh that's

01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,280
really cool and then i see

01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:13,600
like matt and slack and i'm like wait oh

01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,719
wait what oh i think it's like a it is a

01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,600
testament too as well

01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,239
to open source and how accessible people

01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,880
are

01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:23,040
like they're like i like john gold i've

01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,480
seen him from his airbnb days and i've

01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,880
seen some projects that he shipped as

01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,280
well

01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,000
uh in the open source space uh and also

01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,560
the design space

01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,520
as well um but a lot of people are

01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,600
pretty approachable

01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,560
so like i'm looking at the graphical the

01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,800
contributor graph

01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,920
as well for graphical and there are a

01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,600
few people like lee

01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,880
he's a familiar face like he's super

01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,239
approachable if you meet him at a

01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,000
conference or

01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:45,280
see him walking down the street

01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,760
hopefully in a

01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,800
couple months in sf if we do open up and

01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,400
stuff like that

01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,320
uh and then i see your face here and

01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,600
like one of the first things i did

01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,760
was mention you uh

01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,280
asking questions whether my actually i

01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,000
wonder if i could even find the issue

01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,920
that

01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,199
the issue in question that got me down

01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,120
this rabbit hole

01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:08,800
um i wonder actually so

01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,960
i'm gonna have to open up the sauce too

01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,560
as well because i do have it linked into

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,080
this is my project and this is

01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,360
i was not trying to promote my project

01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,040
but i've actually brought it up a couple

01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:22,080
times but

01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:22,080
i do link it here

01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,000
oh there we go yeah so the pro the

01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,560
issues

01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,440
i remember yeah yeah so the issues that

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,040
i i

01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,639
attach myself to for contributions

01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,400
that's what open source does uh and

01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:38,400
that's a project i'm working on

01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:40,000
and i wonder if there is a comment i

01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,520
remember seeing this because i was i saw

01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,560
your pr and i was like this is a great

01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,239
idea

01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,080
yeah yeah actually i think what it is

01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:50,159
it's it got closed

01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,800
so i wonder because the this is a 2016

01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:56,560
issue that was uh

01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,520
that was invalid i wonder if i'm gonna

01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,120
be able to find it and

01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,639
the problem is all my stuff is i don't

01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,520
query for open foreclosed

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,560
issues but uh oh yeah anyway i'll post

01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,560
it on twitter and

01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,239
uh if anybody wants to follow me and

01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,600
i'll talk about my experience in

01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,960
contributing to graphql almost

01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,560
contributing to the graphical

01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,239
uh and finding out that the the problem

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,000
was already solved through

01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:20,400
some other unrelated pr's i'm sorry

01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,239
no no it's good times and knowing that

01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,400
it's super valid too knowing that there

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,000
are issues that could be closed

01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,239
like that's actually a valid

01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,440
contribution uh just literally just

01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:31,679
going into the issues

01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,960
and paginating to the last page and

01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,360
saying hey is there anything that

01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,600
actually is sort of cr like crusty

01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,480
like there there is stale bot uh which

01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,920
is great

01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,520
but sometimes stale bot can be a little

01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,639
aggressive um

01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,159
yeah so instead like why don't you

01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,400
actually i don't i don't want to should

01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:50,159
on anybody which is uh trying to keep it

01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,600
family-friendly but uh

01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:53,679
yeah like you could do whatever you want

01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,080
but like my goal would be giving a

01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,280
contribution and learning the project so

01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,040
i might even just go through some of

01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,639
these old issues and look at kyle's here

01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:04,159
for uh

01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,520
maintainer and uh founder of gatsby um

01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:07,360
but yeah go through here and say hey is

01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,400
this still valid

01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:14,400
i tried doing this myself

01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:17,280
we decided to make this um

01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,760
this is the one feature we decided if

01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,600
you

01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,840
if you see the one everyone responded to

01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:25,040
where i announced above there

01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:27,360
um given that oh

01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,639
yeah this one given that we're doing one

01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,600
final

01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,159
so we also the decision to do a 1.0 was

01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,800
like

01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:36,000
a few weeks ago too so before nice

01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,840
calling it 2.0

01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,440
or we were this is all going to be 1.0

01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,000
with plugins yeah but

01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,000
we decided that 1.0 should just be like

01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,480
a stable version of the old

01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,840
graphical and we and we decided we're

01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,920
just going to add one feature which is

01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,920
the headers tab inspired by graphical

01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,960
playground

01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,560
to uh to unlock this ability to make it

01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,520
easier for people to authenticate

01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,120
because

01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,120
while you can um

01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,880
well you can programmatically add

01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,280
headers

01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,199
by overwriting the fetcher function that

01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,320
you pass as a prop to the graphical

01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,199
component

01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,840
um it's not ideal for users who just

01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,639
want to

01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,920
pass headers on the fly and treat it as

01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:22,880
just like a kind of generic

01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,000
ide so um yeah because in other

01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,639
companies we've

01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,960
we generate you know you you like we've

01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,639
made it so you have like a login flow

01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,040
and then that generates the fetcher

01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:36,639
function with your credentials

01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:39,679
and every request has that but um

01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,000
but this this allowed um this allows you

01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:41,920
to

01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,440
override headers on the fly by each

01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,400
request or

01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,159
and set them default headers across the

01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:51,040
board too yeah so you have both

01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:51,600
both options um and so that was the one

01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,199
feature

01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,600
there's so many other features we want

01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:57,520
to give people but this is the one that

01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,000
was probably most in demand

01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,199
by anyone there's been people who were

01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,040
just like ah

01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:04,719
f this i'm going to use playground and

01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,719
i'm like i don't blame you

01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,480
i've been there yeah i will admit

01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:10,239
there's a company once where we were so

01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,360
frustrated with graphical we switched to

01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,880
the playground

01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,880
um and now i'm a maintainer

01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:20,000
and that's a whole yeah yeah there's a

01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,840
whole if people are interested there's a

01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,360
whole article about that on the graphql

01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,000
foundation blog

01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,880
where we announce that that the efforts

01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,239
are joining

01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:33,120
forces so that there will be a build of

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,760
graphical playground or i'm sorry of a

01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,800
graphical

01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,280
a preset if you will um that enables

01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,000
that

01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,400
yeah yeah this this guy is great he he

01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,320
added

01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,480
he hadn't worked with react before

01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,280
either he was he's a rubius a rails

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,199
developer

01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:51,840
so it's very graphql uh

01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:52,560
he's really he just he just went for it

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,400
so there's one

01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,760
little bug with it luckily it's all

01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,800
still an alpha this is

01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:01,520
a graphical 1.0 alpha 11

01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,080
that contains this release and then 12

01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,639
we're gonna

01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:06,560
patch the one one little bug with when

01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,600
you have the header

01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,400
that tab disabled a couple other small

01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,080
bugs

01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:16,320
um that we're addressing

01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:18,560
but for the most part we're pretty i

01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:21,600
hope to release 1.0

01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,040
this weekend and finally merge the

01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,400
rewrite pr

01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:28,480
and so that half done redesign

01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,600
that you all are familiar with yes we'll

01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,600
be in master

01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,199
and then excellent you can start adding

01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,080
on that and then i'm going to start

01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,639
building out

01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,639
rebuilding like yeah there we go you

01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,920
know building up that issue with the api

01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,960
proposal and stuff

01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:46,080
and well yeah yeah

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:48,400
i am a whiz at uh left padding so

01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,120
i can add some left pad to this right

01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,400
here

01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:53,280
yeah there you go yeah i mean we want to

01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,600
make that

01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,520
that's gonna be like a vs code style

01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,920
like icon menu

01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,120
excellent um except accessibility first

01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,239
for everything that's the other thing is

01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:05,120
i want to do a quick

01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:06,239
uh accessibility i already did an audit

01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,040
um

01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:11,440
um with madeline at gatsby are one of

01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,280
our accessibility experts and

01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,480
we came up with some things to improve

01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,679
on um

01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,480
we actually have it was actually one of

01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:22,080
those

01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:24,960
uh really teachable moments um

01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:27,040
where for a while we we were aware that

01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,840
there were accessibility issues

01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:31,920
with graphical but they kind of kept

01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,000
getting kicked down the road yeah

01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:35,280
until the the thing that you don't want

01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,760
to have happen happen

01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,719
where someone opened an issue on behalf

01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,560
of their co-worker

01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:46,239
and said hey my co-worker is blocked

01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:48,560
on working on our project because

01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:49,679
they're using a screen reader browser

01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,480
and they can't

01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:53,199
use graphical yeah it's not usable and

01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,239
so

01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:58,880
a generous user within

01:28:56,239 --> 01:29:00,480
a month had created an awesome pr and

01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,639
address a lot of the issues

01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,840
a few other issues have regressed a bit

01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,679
and the lesson learned

01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,560
is i mean we already have a cypress

01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,360
suite which is another thing if someone

01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,639
wants to do

01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:15,040
another low hanging fruit si adding to

01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,880
the cypress suite would be great

01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,480
um it's it's tricky to do in the middle

01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:21,760
of a rewrite though

01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,840
you know yeah but um but

01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,280
we should be at we shouldn't have cyprus

01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:28,560
acts in our in our

01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:30,639
suite so that we can track oh

01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,920
it's in a graphic it's in the sub

01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,520
package oh the package

01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:37,199
oh okay of course yeah yeah it required

01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,639
having a blank

01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:44,000
um okay object to the root yeah

01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:46,159
um this way we can have a sub

01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,120
sweep so to speak yeah that makes

01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,840
difference

01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,880
yeah so integration is where all the

01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,520
tests are yeah

01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,120
so yeah so uh speaking of accessibility

01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,320
i do apologize we do have closed

01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,239
captioning but i just

01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,679
i realize halfway through it's only

01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:02,239
capturing my voice

01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,800
uh so i did not actually enable it for

01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,440
ricky

01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,600
your voice so big apologies so if you

01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,120
are listening closed captioning on

01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,800
twitch you are not actually getting

01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,960
ricky's voice the entire time so

01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,239
i will fix that for future streams but

01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,520
uh i mean we're all

01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,440
i think i'm i'm figuring this out as i

01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,400
go along i will make sure that's for the

01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,480
next time

01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,400
um but also i realize we're also on time

01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,199
so i i want to

01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,880
give like a quick uh round of if anybody

01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,280
has questions just feel free to drop

01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,239
them

01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,080
drop them in um i definitely look

01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,679
forward to i'll be watching some pr's

01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,080
and some blog posts and stuff like that

01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:35,360
and

01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,040
i feel like i have a good a good

01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,320
understanding of like the working group

01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,920
uh even the sitting in on those

01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,840
conversations would be super

01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,280
um i'd love to absorb some of that

01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,400
knowledge just me personally as a

01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,080
contributor

01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,440
um and i think i have a good

01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,480
understanding of the packages but if

01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,719
anybody has

01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,000
is confused like feel free to answer ask

01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,760
questions or even

01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,679
i think uh it seems like it's okay to

01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,840
open up a discussion of this general

01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:00,159
like hey i just need

01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,320
i need direction and help on how to

01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,600
actually understand this project um so

01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,040
that might be a good first step too as

01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,960
well as well as there are good first

01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,280
issues documentation things

01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,760
uh i think questions are correct me up

01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:14,000
or wrong questions ricky would be even

01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:16,480
great to even start if you just want to

01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,480
contribute

01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,639
there's no dumb questions like they're

01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,120
all good questions

01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,320
yeah the discord is a great place to ask

01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:27,679
questions

01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:30,639
um um i'm

01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,520
i'm always there i respond too quickly

01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,320
probably

01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,960
like like hey shouldn't you be like

01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,239
going to

01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:43,040
sleep it's 1am in new york kind of zone

01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:46,159
and i'm not going to sleep or whatever

01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:49,600
it's getting better uh but um yes i

01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:53,199
i respond very quickly on discord uh

01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:55,199
and i um can usually help people get

01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:57,920
started i can't always

01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:58,320
you know walk people through a lot of

01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,880
things

01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,040
step by step that way office hours are

01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:06,719
good if you have more involved

01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:10,080
um questions um

01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,920
yeah um but for the most part um

01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,679
yeah discord is good and then also the

01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,760
discussions if you have an id if you're

01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,600
trying to implement graphical

01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,600
uh a lot of people end up contributing

01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,679
when they start implementing it and they

01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,440
realize that they want things

01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,280
from graphical that doesn't have or

01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,159
they're not sure how so creating a

01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,639
discussion here

01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:30,400
so here's a great example the discussion

01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:31,920
interface for a graphical plug-in that

01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,239
was a pinned issue

01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,040
that's the plug-in api discussion that

01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:38,159
you were kind of taught

01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:40,080
it needs to be updated um and this is

01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:41,440
like one of orcha's early designs

01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,360
there's another issue that i

01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:45,520
that's linked to from that meta issue

01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:48,560
that's about the redesign

01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,159
yeah and so this is a really great

01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,840
this this was pinned and then i

01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:53,679
converted it to a discussion and it's

01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,320
not pinned it can't be kept

01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,920
can't be labeled uh i mean it's

01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,199
discussions are a great feature but i

01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,480
was like

01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:04,719
you can uh bump the discussion

01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,400
yeah so yeah if this is an important

01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,480
discussion for people to have

01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,159
uh you actually bump it uh i think we're

01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:12,320
feel like this is beta so

01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:13,600
if you or anybody else could actually

01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,000
just click that link you can give

01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,880
feedback directly about this uh feature

01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:21,040
uh which is also super helpful um so we

01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,639
can figure out how to do this

01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:26,960
yeah and the poochie poochie poochie

01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,600
i love that name uh says plus one to the

01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,000
discord it's uh actually really fun

01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:34,639
okay yeah this are you saying in general

01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,960
or our discord

01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,960

01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,320
like i like the subtle pink

01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:53,199
um but i see i see the um what do you

01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,199
call it

01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:57,280
the potential i guess that's what you

01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:59,840
say to your kids when they're

01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:02,159

yes that's right christine's been doing

01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:11,040
a ton of work on the redesign

01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:13,440
pr and rewrite so awesome yeah

01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,719
yeah thanks for stopping by on github

uh you can't beat them yeah so i wanted

01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,520
the shift gears too as we

01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,719
sort of wind down um i have been doing

01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,639
this thing sort of the wind down the

01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,880
conversation of just going to github.com

01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,840
stars and looking at the last thing

01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,400
that's right

01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,960
yeah uh looking at the lasting c shaver

01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,360
okay

01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,199
um looking at the last thing that people

01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,520
have starred so i'm curious if

01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:45,520
uh this is my stars uh feel free to drop

01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,400
in the zoom chat uh whatever the last

01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,760
thing you starred

01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,920
and we'll just talk about those projects

01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,800
as we wind down and then we can sort of

01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,480
uh

01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,239
take any last last minute questions

01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,600
anybody has anything we want to switch

01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:58,400
gears into but

01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,199
uh i'll go first this is uh the linguist

01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,280
action

01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:02,800
so it's a github action and sorry this

01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,320
is literally at random i don't know what

01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,960
the last thing i started so

01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,480
um yeah so just because i might the way

01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,760
i use stars and i realize not a lot of

01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,639
people are actually using

01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,159
stars uh as like a thing to save for

01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,560
later or whatnot but

01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:17,520
i do so just building awareness around

01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,880
this feature

01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,080
um yeah so linguist action it's also a

01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,159
good metric for

01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,119
for maintainers and contributors to know

01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:27,600
what they're doing

01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,119
is uh valuable so i actually got was

01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,960
able to give the first star to this

01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:33,920
project so i'm super proud of that

01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,800
um also i can sponsor too i haven't used

01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,040
it yet so i

01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,800
want to use it before i start sponsoring

01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,560
um but maybe i should sponsor and then

01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:42,320
use it who knows

01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,840
but basically this is built on top of

01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,840
github's linguist

01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,040
repo so if you're interested of how

01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,920
stuff like this on the right

01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:51,280
works um we can look at the code and

01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,159
identify

01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:56,000
ruby um that how much ruby is in the the

01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:57,760
project this is a docker file like

01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,840
sort of the breaking up of the the

01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,040
project uh that's this right here and

01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,840
that's how we're doing it

01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,480
um it's a ruby gym and someone built a

01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,000
rapper

01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:08,800
that does oh you created a docker image

01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,679
for

01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,880
github linguist oh interesting nice uh

01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:14,719
crazy max in the chat

01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,920
curry max actually has a ton of awesome

01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:17,840
actions so

01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,440
he is worth a i think it's like is it

01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,159
crazy underscore max

01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,960
uh he's definitely worth a follow um or

01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:25,600
a star

01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,719
on github 2 as well but yeah basically

01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,320
this is the action

01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,480
it gives you that data but as an action

01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,520
form um so highly recommend

01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:34,880
checking it out i actually haven't i i

01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,159
marked it because the open source

01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,520
project i'm working on i want to do

01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:39,679
something very similar

01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,119
for that project so since this is

01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,000
already a solved problem i want to get

01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:44,560
that data

01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,600
as part of my ci so crazymax crazy max

01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,199
awesome

01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,960
and i'm pretty sure crazy max i've got a

01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:52,480
star

01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:53,199
somewhere in the top looks like i don't

01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,119
have one

01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:56,320
i might have started last week but yeah

01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,000
you had an action as well

01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,480
around the github status as well

01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,080
actually so yg

01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:04,159
who is uh who's been helping me out a

01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,239
lot of my projects he built something in

01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:07,920
inspiration of one of one of your uh

01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:09,600
your projects so crazy max has dropped

01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,960
in his docker linguist thing

01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,719
uh but crazymax also dropped uh

01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,199
a link on twitter around this github

01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:20,159
action to tell you github status

01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,800
so yg actually built another cli plug-in

01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:23,199
to do

01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,639
exactly the same thing but cli form just

01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:27,119
checking the status of

01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:28,320
of github and so that way you can see if

01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,880
all things are operational

01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,360
i think crazy max is uh his action came

01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,639
through

01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,880
last week we had some downtime for

01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,679
actions so knowing that your action

01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,960
that your action is not the problem but

01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:39,600
perhaps something else is happening

01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,000
upstream

01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,880
uh is super super awesome yeah yeah it

01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,560
looks like you all

01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,119
you all connected to as well so that's

01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,199
awesome so if i stalled enough did you

01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:51,119
have a um

01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:54,080
a anything that you've started in the

01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:56,400
last say i guess the last star you have

01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,840
yeah let's look at what i i was curious

01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:00,000
what my last star

01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,280
might have been i've been using stars

01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,520
for forever

01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:05,119
i just realized too i could actually add

01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:09,520
i think i could do

01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:12,800
is it aco a-c-a-o

01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,119
it's a portuguese for action oh

01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,440
nice i i picked it a long time i went

01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:19,440
and i learned portuguese in college

01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,960
if there's any brazilians or portuguese

01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,520
folks here go ahead and

01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:26,560
test me yeah you know it's funny enough

01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:29,280
that i actually did a um

01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,000
i did a workshop in brazil and i think

01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:33,040
that actually came

01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,119
up as the uh if you look at these

01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,560
oh sorry this is the hackathon oh

01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:38,719
private information

01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,080
anyway that's a private org but uh this

01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,320
one's a public one

01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:44,239
and uh i just had a freudian i've been

01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,840
going to the hackathon a lot but i have

01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:48,239
a workshop that i gave in

01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,199
in brazil and we had it like translated

01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:51,520
as well

01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,400
so we do have brazilian a brazilian

01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,040
version

01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,840
i think we have the brazilian files no

01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,960
that's the actual

01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,840
action itself but i say that because the

01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,760
word action

01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:04,159
came up oh you know what it's it's in

01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,560
this folder the ptbr

01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:09,119
so all this is brazilian uh i think the

01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,480
way it works with chrome it's gonna

01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,000
yeah there we go i wasn't sure if it

01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,040
would live translated on there because

01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,480
github does have

01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,159
it does our story chrome does that for

01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,360
you uh but yeah this is all the

01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:19,360
portuguese version of

01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:21,360
github action so if you want to learn

01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:24,400
actions sorry to derail you a bit but

01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,480
you just i've never seen that word when

01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,280
i was at that in brazil but yeah so i

01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:30,000
was i loved

01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,400
other languages on github yeah i was

01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,840
actually

01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,880
able to see your your actions so it

01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,880
looks like you got an atlassian

01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,800
this is actually a great one so we're

01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,360
considering moving to this from learn a

01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,400
publish

01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:46,159
so it allows us to

01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:50,480
um have more like

01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:54,719
granular and highly specific

01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:56,080
plan releases so because right now

01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,239
you just kind of you just run learn or

01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:00,159
publish and say yes or no and it usually

01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:04,000
kind of matches up with what you want

01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:05,760
yeah and um but we run it locally and we

01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,360
want to run it in ci

01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,600
you know but we don't want to publish on

01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,719
every ci build maybe a canary on every

01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:14,400
ci build

01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:17,440
or every uh every merge to master rather

01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:20,960
but we do want to be able to publish

01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,800
from ci only ideally

01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,280
now that we have github actions it's a

01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,719
more secure environment we were using uh

01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,440
travis before

01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,199
and uh benji had some very good valid

01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,719
concerns about security of publishing

01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:35,360
using travis so

01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:38,080
um but with github actions we were able

01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:40,080
we even tested it ourselves to confirm

01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:42,000
yeah actually that a user couldn't

01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,199
expose our secrets

01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,400
because the npm token is our last

01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:49,440
defense

01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,400
um for for a lot of like if you publish

01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:54,000
from ci

01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,639
just make sure you your npm token is a

01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,560
secret

01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:59,679
please for the sake of the whole npm

01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,840
commute or the whole node community

01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,760
like the last thing we need is another

01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,199
uh oh i can't even remember

01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:09,040
what that ah there was that one library

01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:11,360
that was pretty notorious that

01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,360
yeah i think it was uh left past some

01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,400
that was a left pad yes that's what i

01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:20,239
was alluding to here

01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:20,239
here minus uh no having no left pad yes

01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,040
so um yeah max is actually shouting out

01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,000
a

01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,480
code ql which is a another another

01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,320
feature

01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,480
in our security lab to be able to scan

01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,560
for vulnerabilities

01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,840
nice so everybody opt in your your

01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,760
projects to

01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,960
do that scanning for us or for the

01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,719
community it's not even for github it's

01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,440
for literally the open source community

01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,960
to

01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:46,960
share around vulnerabilities yeah i we

01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,679
have we have vulnerability alerts for

01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,440
graphical

01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:51,360
i have i actually have dependable

01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:52,960
configured for only secure like

01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,560
immediate security updates

01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,239
yeah we used to use the pentabot for

01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,719
everything and then i

01:41:56,239 --> 01:42:00,239
i love the pen device yeah a little bit

01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:05,119
noisy for me so

01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:08,400
um so we do uh like big batch like dev

01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:11,199
um dev dependency updates yeah our

01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:13,199
our dependencies are thankfully minimal

01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:14,639
and so we're able to do those piecemeal

01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:17,760
as needed and

01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:19,679
use use generic resolutions and

01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,520
and then test with the preview just to

01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,159
be sure yeah today is actually my

01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,440
dependent

01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,520
day yeah i do once a month there you go

01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:29,199
once a month and uh today is that day

01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,719
and i'll be i'll be actually merging the

01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,639
prs later tonight

01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,239
uh just getting stuff okay but i'm also

01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,719
i i only

01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:37,600
i mostly merge the security ones uh if

01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,520
they come up

01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,440
uh i don't always merge all the uh the

01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:43,040
my the patch releases

01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,840
if they're not if they don't affect me

01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:48,400
then i don't i don't merge them

01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,840
yeah that's yeah i i know that that

01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,280
feeling where you're just like wait does

01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,719
this affect me and you just have to

01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:53,440
spend the next three minutes to make

01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:55,360
sure it's not

01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,639
in production yeah and we had that we

01:42:55,360 --> 01:43:01,119
actually had uh

01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:03,920
marked uh oh yeah i remember that

01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:04,320
had one and we actually it was right

01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:07,040
away

01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,320
you know dependable had a pr for us and

01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:10,480
that was really good to have

01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,159
um i remember before all of that you

01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,760
know there's like once there's this big

01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,920
express vulnerability

01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,920
and i was building it i was working on a

01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,360
server-side rendered application it's

01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:23,040
called mbc.com

01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:24,239
anyways it there was a big express

01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:27,520
vulnerability

01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:29,679
in production and you know we had to go

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:31,440
about it all manually there was no there

01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:34,800
was no um

01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:36,719
what what was the npm audit there was no

01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,639
uh whatever what was the precursor to

01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,719
npm audit when it was a standalone

01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,159
uh honestly i don't remember cli i

01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:44,080
remember mpmi

01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:46,159
uh that that being a thing but i don't

01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,920
remember what predated it

01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,920
yeah it was something that got merged

01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:52,960
into npm like npm bought

01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:55,520
the project yeah nsp nsp

01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,639
yes so yeah and that was before that we

01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,719
just had we just knew

01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,719
because there was a cve and i was

01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:03,119
subscribing to cves

01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:05,119
and yeah i have a bunch of infosec

01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:08,000
friends that are always like

01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:09,600
making fun of me for using those so

01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,239
they're always like challenging me on

01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,520
stuff

01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:14,560
but um but yeah it's very important to

01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,840
check on this

01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:19,600
um because people's you know companies

01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,000
whole schemas are there there's data

01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,119
flying

01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,159
around that could be pii or phi

01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:27,920
yeah so any vulnerability you know

01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:29,360
when you when you have a popular open

01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,840
source project which is

01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:33,280
a great and wonderful and rare

01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:36,800
opportunity to have

01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:40,400
um like when you do it suddenly

01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,520
like the the blast radius is

01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:44,320
incalculable you know the the impact of

01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,360
one bug

01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,000
you you can't fully know because you

01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,679
don't even know how

01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,280
people are using your code yeah because

01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,280
like if you look at this

01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,560
number now this is uh i guess a little

01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,719
offsecuted because

01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,840
you have packed sub packages so i'm not

01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,360
sure how

01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,760
well this number works when you have the

01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,960
the awareness system

01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,600
but uh like even 3873

01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,440
people companies projects are depending

01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,719
on this package not being vulnerable

01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,800
so like there's a lot of trust that

01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,639
comes in open source and when you

01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,400
know that projects like yourselves are

01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,520
are concerned of like can your tokens

01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,360
could be

01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,880
published publicly uh because i don't

01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,600
want to use graphical and start mining

01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,960
bitcoin or

01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:28,080
monero or whatever it is like i i i lean

01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,760
into these people over here who are

01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,119
contributing and make sure making sure

01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,920
that this is maintained

01:45:31,119 --> 01:45:34,719
to like the up this key so awesome good

01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,239
faces there

01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,000
yeah we didn't even touch on to that too

01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:40,000
as well that um like

01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,040
sponsorship i know there's a graphql

01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,480
foundation

01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:45,679
uh but it is everybody funding the the

01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,040
foundation and that's funding the

01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,480
projects within the i guess the

01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,960
landscape

01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:53,600
yes yeah so the landscape is a good way

01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,920
to chart that out we have like a main

01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:58,480
graphql fund and that goes to yvonne for

01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,719
graphql js mostly right now

01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,159
um and then for like events and stuff

01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,480
like that but then we also have a

01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:06,800
special fund just for graphical now

01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:08,480
okay so companies are contributing to

01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:12,159
that and they've been real generous

01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:16,159
so um and it's been great so

01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:18,000
um yeah we were able to just allocate

01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:21,440
some of those funds

01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:24,560
uh to add another intern and

01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:27,360
um yeah there's a ton

01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,280
of them so if you work at a company that

01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:31,679
uses graphql

01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,600
and you think they should be a member by

01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:36,880
all means or if you're a startup

01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:39,280
and you want to be um

01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,000
you know there's different tiers of

01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,239
membership

01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,679
and and price points and stuff to make

01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:47,040
it accessible

01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,600
um and we also recently added uh

01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:52,000
the guild who's a wonderful open source

01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:55,360
team that contributes a lot of other

01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,440
great graphql um ecosystem

01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,639
libraries and maintain some very

01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,560
important things like they just took

01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:03,119
over graphql tools

01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:05,119
um and graph killed codegen all these

01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:07,600
wonderful projects they

01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:08,960
um we made them an honorary member just

01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,760
because of their commitment

01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,400
and what was that company uh or that's

01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,560
the guild

01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,000
oh they're they're they're kind of an

01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,679
open they're like their own

01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,840
version of open collective so they're

01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:23,440
not open collective but they're like

01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:26,400
a graphql focused collective

01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,600
um and then also props to sean and one

01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,360
graph who

01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,880
i think we're in the process of doing

01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:34,000
something similar

01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,760
um and it's great to have

01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,760
all the stakeholders because yeah the

01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:41,280
way i think about graphical

01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:43,840
is that um a developer from

01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:45,920
airbnb or facebook their needs are just

01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:48,239
as important as

01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:50,000
yours or anyone who's just like hey i

01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:52,000
have this project and i want to use

01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,360
graphical whether you have a startup

01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
whether you're just learning how to use

01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:58,880
graphql everyone's needs to me

01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,080
are just as important you know and to

01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,159
other maintainers

01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,159
so and not that wasn't the case when

01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:06,159
facebook was the maintainer but

01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:08,480
yeah because we're coming from graphql

01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:09,920
foundation which is a project of the

01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:13,440
linux foundation

01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:14,239
we have these really like nerdly

01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,960
exacting

01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:18,080
open source like free libre open source

01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,639
principles to follow

01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,840
and that's not showing favoritism that's

01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:25,119
why in our reference

01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,679
implementations we we don't

01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:30,000
choose we don't like we'd love to maybe

01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:31,600
use apollo for swappy graphql right but

01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,440
we don't or or relay

01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,360
right yeah i mean we do use relay but we

01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,760
don't use the full relay stack

01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,760
right so there's like there's there's

01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,880
different choices we make because we

01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,080
don't want

01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:46,080
graphql users to think that oh well

01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:47,600
graphql foundation thinks this frame

01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,600
works the best so i'm going to go with

01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:52,719
it because that creates unfair

01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:54,560
um advantages we want every company

01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:57,040
that's building a graphql framework

01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,960
every open source graphql framework

01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:01,360
every

01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,159
every product that uses graphql to have

01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,880
uh

01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:05,840
to be able to compete you know or or

01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,840
build together

01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,600
you know and that's what open source is

01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,840
a great example of how

01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,880
powerful open source can be where

01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,280
companies

01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,400
that otherwise would be competing are

01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:19,360
contributing

01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,199
funding the same work you know and and

01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:24,400
building out from that

01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:26,239
so yeah it's i like to joke that

01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:27,760
that there really is no competition in

01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:30,400
the graphql

01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,920
ecosystem and software world like it

01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,679
might seem that there is but

01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,760
everyone's got something unique to bring

01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,800
to the table and we're all in it

01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,119
together

01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,599
and working together on stuff i work

01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:42,480
with people from apollo team the relay

01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:44,800
team

01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,679
i work with people at microsoft facebook

01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:47,199
airbnb

01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,199
there's a couple people on the call here

01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:52,719
there's just you know

01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:56,719
i but also just you know hashira

01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:58,560
and uh benji has post graphic and these

01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,639
other open source frameworks that are

01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:03,360
just as important as these

01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:05,520
big you know vc funded projects as well

01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:08,560
you know all of it is because we want

01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,800
people to to keep innovating and

01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,760
building the next you know great thing

01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,000
like i i

01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:16,159
feel the same way about graphical i hope

01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,520
even after the plug-in rewrite and all

01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:18,400
these cool things are happening that

01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,119
someone says

01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:22,719
you know what this kind of sucks i think

01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:24,560
this could be better i'm going to build

01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:25,760
from scratch a new one i'm going to fork

01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,599
it and make it better

01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,000
i want that you know i've told people

01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:32,320
that because someone was disappointed

01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,679
the graphical playground was going to

01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:37,599
be folded into graphical um

01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:39,360
and i said well hey here's some

01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,119
libraries to use

01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,480
um here's the starting point and i'd

01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:45,199
love to see you build

01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:46,880
you know you can build using art tooling

01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:49,679
a great

01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,560
you know competing quote unquote product

01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,960
and

01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,000
and we'll all be in it together and you

01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,239
can help us

01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,280
build um see it this is the rising tide

01:50:56,239 --> 01:51:00,639
raises all boats

01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,639
that that sort of yes yeah yes

01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,760
yeah so more more adoption and graphql

01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:05,520
is not gonna

01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,560
there's no need for confrontation but

01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,520
right now we're just trying to figure

01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,960
out the spec

01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:12,719
uh so if you have a direction you want

01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,119
to see the spec go you want to see

01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,719
the project go or graphical go or the

01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:18,000
playground grow because i was a big fan

01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,960
of the playground too as well i'm still

01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,080
a big fan

01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,800
um yeah me too there's opportunity like

01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,880
a mast

01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,040
so like i think if we could sum this up

01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,599
and to say like just get involved

01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:30,480
like if the question happens in in

01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,239
graphical

01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:34,000
like let's have the question there the

01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:35,760
conversation there if there's another

01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,199
project within the graphql ecosystem

01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,520
that we were just looking at

01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:41,040
um i think at this point like i think

01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,560
hopefully everybody feels empowered to

01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:45,119
just ask the question

01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:47,520
we had throughout the i think i already

01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:49,920
already lost the uh the project

01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:51,599
but uh yeah anyway we we threw out the

01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,360
idea of the discord so if you just want

01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,800
to go in there and chat or have a find

01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,800
another place to

01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:58,000
to hang out uh definitely go to the

01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,360
discord server

01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
which i'll just post that directly in

01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:04,960
the chat and then start the conversation

01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:06,719
like if you're looking to contribute um

01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,520
find ricky apparently he's always online

01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,040
so

01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,800
ask the questions and i'm pretty sure

01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:14,480
you can get some some mentorship

01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:16,400
into the the platform the project

01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,840
but um with that being said where i i

01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:21,119
