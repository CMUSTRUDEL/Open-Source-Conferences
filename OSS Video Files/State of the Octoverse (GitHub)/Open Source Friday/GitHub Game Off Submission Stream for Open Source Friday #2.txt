00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,960
late

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,160
i had some very interesting fun times

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,559
with my computer

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
i had it all set up ready to go about an

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,680
hour ago

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,280
and then when i about 15 minutes ago

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000

live everything died the camera died the

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
microphone died and then my computer

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,760
died and i was like oh fun

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
this is why you need two computers for

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
streaming

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,159
that's my top tip for today get two

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,880
computers

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
for streaming um but yeah how is

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,479

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,119
is everyone having a lovely afternoon a

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,880
lovely

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,680
evening a lovely morning depending on

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,040
where you're tuning in from

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520

and i have two pcs and i totally should

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,119
use two pcs

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,320

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
who was actually who was how many people

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,040
were here last week

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,879
i want to know how many people were here

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,400
this week

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
and then last day i'll talk about it all

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
again anyway but if you're here last say

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,720
you would have heard us talk about

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,879
what the actual github game off is and

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
the github game off is a

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,480
fun exciting game challenge where you

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,760
create

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799
a game in any kind of language and there

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,680
are

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
no restrictions on what you create

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,640
there's no

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,200
criteria of like has to be written in

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,159
this language or has to be this size

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
it is just make a game and the only

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,080
criteria

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,120
is you have to hit the theme

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
in some way shape or form so last year's

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,959
theme for the github game off

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,239
was moonshot so let's have a look oh

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
actually we didn't do the highlight

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,400
let's do the highlights so this was the

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,319
highlights

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
from some of the games and you will see

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,239
we will play some of them

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
um and you'll see that some of them

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,600
really hit the theme and others just

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:29,840
took it to the next level so let's have

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,840
a quick look

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:42,860
[Music]

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:50,379
that one was really funny

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:50,379
[Music]

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
that was one

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:11,840
[Music]

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:11,840
that one was hilarious

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:25,440
[Music]

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,520
that was really fun um but you might

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,400
remember me saying um if you were here

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,759
last week

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,360
that unlike a lot of competitions or

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
hackathons there's no

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,080
there's no judging for the github game

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,759
off instead so there's no judges panel

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,560
sorry there's judging there's no judge's

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,919
panel um instead of

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,800
having like a judging panel

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,720
anyone who submits a game and they were

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
just on 500 submissions

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
last year anyone who submits a game is

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,560
able to judge everyone else's game

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,199
so six categories that the games get

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,160
judged i think i actually wrote them

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
i wrote them somewhere um oh actually

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
you know where i did write them on the

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
dev 2 post that i put up at the end of

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
last week

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
um so let's have a quick look at my

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
dashboard and i'll

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,440
share this with you so here were

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,880
that was the one we wrapped up for my

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,479
sake so here are the

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,319
top categories there's the is an overall

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,240
category there's a gameplay category

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,039
graphics audio theme interpretation and

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
innovation so

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,039
six categories and if you submit a game

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,039
for the game off you get to

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
you basically get to judge everyone else

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
how many games are multiplayer oh i

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,440
actually don't have the stats on that

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
when lee riley jumps in he might know

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,080
the stats on the number of games that

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,960
were submitted

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,600
there were multiplayer versus number

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,880
games a single player

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,319
majority speaking the game's a single

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,720
player but you may have remembered

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
last week one of the games that we

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,680
played was actually up to

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,400
eight players it was insane it was it

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,720
was nice

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
i was like how are so many games um well

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,280
actually you know what to kick us off

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,400
i'm going to show you all

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
really briefly so this was a game that

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,560
we

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
highlighted last week and this is lee

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,639
riley's

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,599
favorite game of all the github gamers

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,840
this game was submitted in 2017 i think

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:27,919
2017 and it's just such an awesome game

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,680
but this is like

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,880
this game is like the pinnacle of like

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,759
what leigh looks for

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,360
in games i'm gonna say lately riley is

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,319
the guy from github who actually runs

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
the github game off

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
competition but as i said we don't

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,360
actually

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
judge the games so no one from github

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
java just games no

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
fancy judging panel is literally a

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,199
community

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,240
but this is one we played last week to

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
show you all how cool it looks um and

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,520
you may have remembered that lee

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,199
actually mentioned

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,639
that he built this into an arcade

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,800
and i actually want to go and make this

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,039
now

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
i actually want to go make this game

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,400
right so

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
we'll talk a bit more about it we'll

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,800
talk about it a bit more in a second

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,520
but each of the games are open sourced

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
so

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,479
we will show you something

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
i'll show you some of them but each of

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
the games are open source so you can go

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,160
and you can download the games

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
you can play them um but what i really

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,080
like is that you can

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,959
um phone them so what i want to

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
try and do

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,599
is um oh wow

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,120
what i want to try and do is grab this

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,159
game and put it into

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,560
rgb neon lights and hook it up to like

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,120
all my razor profiles

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,959
um so lee has this game built into an

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,240
arcade

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,240
he said i want to like

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,600
oh that was really good so i want to be

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
able to go on here so

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,440
we have a look at that one then let's

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,850
get out of it

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,929
and then

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,929
[Music]

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,240
so this was it here so we all we use the

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,519
um

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,880
hdio platform for the games and each one

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,480
will go into each game

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,440
so don't worry about that um but each of

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
the games are hosted on this platform

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,519
or like a showcase on this platform and

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,640
then you can go to the github repo for

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,560
every single one of them

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,920
yeah i think a lot of maths was

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
definitely involved in this one it's

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
like

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,480
crazy so you can download latest build

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,160
or we can go here so i've already

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
started i'm pretty sure

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,600
um we can go and like get all the code

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,600
oh i could open it up in code spaces

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,600
but uh yeah i actually don't have any

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,480
active

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
yeah let's just like

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,680
you know what i could do github

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,920
show off some of that really cool things

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,680
um

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,440
give me a terminal window

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
this is what i love about streaming for

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
github i get to show off some of the

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
cool things we're doing

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:17,839
okay um let's go to

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,360
my directory where i've got all

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
where have i got them all saved

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
go to the directory where i've got all

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,600
my oops

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,640
cd like that thank you open

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
entry okay um gh make sure we've got

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
github working

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,760
sure get out working in the command line

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,040
all right now let's go

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,480
gh repo clone

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,360
i think that's the command maxi

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,360
levy box project dash

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,360
skylines

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
excluding sweet now i am cloning the

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,959
rainbow

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,920
so what i can do now is i can

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,320
sweet i've now cloned the repo so that

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
repo is now cloned and i can now go and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
change it

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,360
i can open it so if i go to where i just

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,839
put that repo project silence all right

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
let's open

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,200
that open in windows terminal i can open

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,839
a channel i could open a window

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
get up desktop or i could open it up in

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,120
i use this bs code

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,720
cbs code

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
yes code not cued

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,519
uh let me just shut down my last close

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,640
folder

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,760
save all right so vs code

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,320
here it is beautiful working and then we

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,000
dump the project skylines

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,519
in here and we can just start like

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,720
working on things so here's all the

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,240
assets some

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,880
project skylines there's gonna be so

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,480
much stuff in here there you go

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
neon skylines

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,320
this is gonna be crazy oh ship color

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
oh okay so obviously this one's written

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,639
in unity

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,560
um you can see that it's like calling

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,680
all the unity commands there

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
uh the ship color is public class so

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,160
we'd have to go and like find it all

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
and then see what we can change this is

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,360
actually

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:28,000
really cool i'm white keen

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,800
thread manager time controls i just want

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,720
to change the colors

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,160
there's not net core you may not be able

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,440
to run it yeah i don't know

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,560
um i should be able to get the net core

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
anyway on here

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,760
travis oh look at the yaml file all

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,399
right let's have a look

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,839
line pattern whoa that's how they're

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,839
doing everything that's

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
crazy

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
these guys are insane well when i say

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,120
these guys there's literally one guy

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,639
marketplace has extensions to help with

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,760
metaphiles okay cool

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:11,120
thank you this is really cool

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,440
effects image effects whoa look at them

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,760
all

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,399
this is a lot of coding but it's like

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
really cool

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,800
player so there's our ship so we are wow

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
that's crazy

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,120
yeah i started learning unity but

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:37,360
there's no way i can do all this

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,830
system using collections that's ship

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
color

00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,880
[Music]

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,519
i wonder where you actually find the

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,000
color for it

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,639
it's pretty cool though anyway that's

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,440
what you can basically do

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
change the color the prefab and unity

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,360
yeah i'm reading all the files i need

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,480
you know

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,839
actually you know what i could literally

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,839
just go into unity

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,160
and dump the whole folder into unity

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,959
yeah i know there's no way i'd edit it

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,320
directly in code so i can probably just

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,320
as you said just edit it

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
directly in unity copy

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,519
just go ahead um git repose

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,519
project's guys select folder oh

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,519
that means it's done in older version

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,120
missing editor version of this machine

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
select another version from the list

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
i have no idea how to do that anyway

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,839
that's basically how you would do it so

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,760
we'll do that

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
at some other point but for now what

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,360
we're gonna do is we are going to go

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
and have some fun and talk about some of

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,839
the other games

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
so again you can install different

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
versions

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,000
yeah i probably just have to like

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,320
install a different version of it

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,639
but yeah it's okay um we should do that

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,360
on one of my streams actually we are

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,959
gonna do that

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,199
next tuesday on my learning stream

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
um so mish manners we are going to do

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,199
that one

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
that'll be a bit of fun um but for now

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,120
we're going to go back to

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,000
the games to play for this week because

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,639
that's what we are

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
doing and we're going to look at see

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,959
these are the ones we went through last

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,959
week

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,880

started doing more commits and stuff

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
just so they can have game offs this is

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,399
really cool um

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160

literally just a two button game

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,160
so all you use is a and d um

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,650
and this one's also built with unity so

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,839
let's run it

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,600
[Music]

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,480
there you go built with unity the giant

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,880
unity logo comes up

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:09,120
oh it's cute okay

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,120
oh okay so you gotta balance it

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,720
oh i died wow high score one

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,240

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,319
okay so you right do you hit the birds

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,120
no okay see

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,160
i died i crashed the rocket okay so it's

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,880
literally just

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,559
a game where you've got to like keep the

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,860
rocket in the air that's it

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,570
okay

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,570
[Music]

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,559
oh i died okay so if you let go

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,760
so if you let go of one of them you like

00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:00,400
lose momentum

00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,400
how do i lose momentum

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,160
i just like run straight into a tree

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,160
with smiley faces what the heck

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,160
okay to balance the rocket through

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,760
the multiverses when then to infinity

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
though this cyborg is going to be a

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,880
viable teleporter get you obviously

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
use the recommendations

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:29,840
okay so we can use this side to like

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,840
teleport out here

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
oh you die by hitting a bird okay that

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
makes

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,559
no sense if i have a giant rocket and i

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,640
crash into a bird

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:56,320
i'm pretty sure the bird is gonna die

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:58,960
not the rocket

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,240
what i literally hit the bird what the

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,120
heck

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,120
it's kind of fun

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,640
okay um yeah also if you want to like

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,880

[Music]

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
right so when you teleport you don't get

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,159

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,159
um keys there we go oh i missed that one

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840

[Music]

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
i wonder i mean this rocket was built by

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,510
a four-year-old

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,690

moonshot

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,400

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,559
we don't want the moon

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
just copy and paste it

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,880

00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,960
destruction

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,679
sequence manager since when has that

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,279
been like a

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,279

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,720
moons what the heck

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,919
whoa that's a very pixelated moon we'll

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
start you on a

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,039
simple moon don't

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,000
your first day the

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,840
more the moon raider has

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:47,840
limited shots oh my god moonerator

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,840
have a moderator

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
hey guys this is the puzzle game this

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,799
this fun fact this game is actually

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,320
written in javascript

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:08,400
as well um and pixiepixie.js

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,840
it which is an open source library for

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,840
building like

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,840
2d content type stuff level two okay

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,600
okay so you gotta hit it in the right

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,640
spot i say

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
yep that's kind of cool i used to be in

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
your chair

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,919
well not that exact chair of course but

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
i was tasked with destruction sequence

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
money

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,679
if something's as i'm at the click of a

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,640
perfect sequence

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,279
yeah so basically what's behind so it's

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
colors

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,320
so i click here so i'm going to show

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,840
that one because if i click this

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
it'll destroy like all that bit

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,880
yeah i'm out of it now so we have to

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
reset it and you can shoot it from any

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,200
angle

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,039
okay that took up

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,520
okay i know i only took that one it's

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,720
using webgl

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,720
okay so if we shoot

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,559
there we go if you grow tired of my

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,799
blabbering you can disable it although

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:39,840
it is nice to talk to someone again it

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:39,840
grows lonely out here amongst the stars

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,880
you're probably wondering about the

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,559
destructions that the colors indicate

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,279
geological

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,679
wet works in the moon's interior the

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,480
moon

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,880
radar mark v 2.9 works best with limited

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
shots

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,679
okay

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,279
so

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,840
there we go

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,960
trying to work out my story are you

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,440
friends are we friends now

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,320
weird well i'm the designer of the moon

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,900
raider she runs smoothly doesn't she

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,840
wasn't always that way

00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,840
[Music]

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,840
so i wonder how this thing what does it

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
like

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
you fire laser destroy neighboring

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,480
colors

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,760
in the moon the remaining blocks fall

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,440
towards the center until you've

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,039
completely destroyed each moon must be

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,320
sold in a certain number

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,120
there's 55 levels okay

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
so it's galactic politics okay so i

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,360
think

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,000
okay so it destroys that color and then

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,840
any colors that are neighboring

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,640
to it okay i think i

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,640
think okay so i destroyed this

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,240
color it should bring all those colors

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,039
together yeah there we go

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
and then i missed that one obviously and

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,399
then

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,120
okay i missed it okay i think i've

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,120
almost got it

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,039
so you need to bring that color into

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,039
that one

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:44,399
and i've only got two shots less i need

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:47,120
to be able to destroy all those colors

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,919
so if it's on a like if it's right on a

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,279
corner

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,520
like that still counts as one

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,279
so we get rid of that there we go and

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,279
then it brings them together

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
okay that makes sense now i got it who

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,679
funds us

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,520
you're a curious one once we discovered

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,200
warp engines you would think that

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
money would stop being a thing

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
we're really getting into politics yeah

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
aren't we

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,440
um okay so that was a bad move because

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
now i can't get all this

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,919
okay so we want the

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,919
hmm

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,880
there we go

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
we had abundant resources and energy

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,440
that could be used any purpose it's

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
shocking i know

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,679
even though even with free energy and

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,799
unaccountable resources money was still

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
a thing

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,480
there you go money is the thing even

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,080
though we're not deep space people

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,320
oh i've got more colors now i'll get

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,279
more shots though as well

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,880
okay so if we get rid of that color

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,320
first

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,279
no it's probably not a good idea to get

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,559
rid of that color first hey

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,840
although we get rid of all the things

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,799
that'll drag the green in together

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,240
there we go turns out it wasn't the

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,559
money people craved up

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,120
power anyone if everyone had infinite

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,760
money then nobody would have power

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,600
certain dreams turn out to be just that

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,600
dreams this is getting real deep

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:37,840
okay let's get rid of that

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,919
okay it's not too bad people just use

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,320
money and therefore

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,159
need jobs don't need to tell you that

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,760
since you're clicking away

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,760
earning those credits right wait we're

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,360
getting credits

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,720
i'm actually getting paid to do this to

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,720
destroy the moon like what the heck

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:05,840
okay that was a bad move i think

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,840
yeah it was very bad

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,240
it gives you life lessons at the same

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,240
time yeah exactly

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,720
let me just show you something different

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,720
this one

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,480
yeah there we go that way

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,679
your purpose well it's our purpose

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,679
really it's the destruction of moons

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
it's simple pure and it's a goal you can

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,320
get behind

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
it's got an outcome pretty good

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,919
wow is that more colors

00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:01,840
okay what if we destroy

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,840
the yellow

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,559
okay what if we destroy

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,760
this one first i think and then we bring

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,760
everything together

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,840
okay that's not gonna work i missed it

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:44,320
yeah i got three shots left okay

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,519
there's not always an answer to the why

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,519
question you can stop

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,919
pestering me just know that you're a

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,440
small cog in a large machine with a pure

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,480
purpose that's right

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,159
it's got to provide job nico provide

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,679
shop satisfaction

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,960
is actually really satisfying this game

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,960
i've always liked puzzle games sorry

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:11,840
we can bring everything together like

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,840
that and then

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,559
i don't always destroy moons of course

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,039
in the beginning

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,120
wow we started with a different aim we

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,960
were making things better

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,399
that's how it started then we just

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
thought we'd start destroying the moon

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,360
instead

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:39,840
okay what about this one

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,840
bring those together

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,080
this is before you were born during the

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
planet wars

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,720
warp had just been invented and while

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,279
there were unlimited planets

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,159
and systems to explore some were more

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,360
important than

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,840
others okay

00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,600
[Music]

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,039
i think we'll get to level 20 and then

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,120
we should

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:08,159
we'll jump to the next game okay let's

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,159
plot those together

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,040
okay it was the crossroads systems that

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
mattered

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,240
when you control where warp exits

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,599
when then you profit from any trade that

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,119
passes through

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:35,839
yes okay that makes that make sense oh

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,839
is that more colors

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:49,839
i messed that one up see

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,520
uh i still messed it up

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,839
okay oh this one's interesting

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,870
[Music]

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,359
dumb

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:31,839
oh it's going to listen i was like oh

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,839
yeah

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,680
okay what do we want to do maybe try

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:45,839
this purple first

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:45,839
or this is a very small one

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,280
so it's just these blocks on the end

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,280
which are really annoying

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,640
okay so if we get rid of that oh i think

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,599
we'll get rid of

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,599
no it won't

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,400
yeah this one's a tricky one let me get

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,000
rid of that

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,000
oh see that gets you the whole lot

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:26,079
yeah okay come on smash a

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,520
and hello colors everyone what's up i'm

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,720
stuck on this one this one's actually a

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,160
little difficult

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:41,839
i think there's like a little trick to

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:41,839
like getting one of these ones out first

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,359
sounds a little tricky

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,839
we tried that first didn't we didn't

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
it's just these ones in the end

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
um

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,880
the walls of brutal destruction was

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,800
constant the destruction sequence to

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,960
destroy planets is the same as some

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,160
moons people and their cities have no

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,280
impact on the console oh no

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:37,839
okay last game last level sorry

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:39,680
we'll jump to the next game

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,680
all right that's actually pretty cool so

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,960
55 levels to play through that we're not

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,359
quite halfway

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,520
but it looks like goes to a whole lot of

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,599
moon universe politics and fun stuff so

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,640
let's just go to the github

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,560
and we'll go and start this one too

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,560
yay get upstairs

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
alrighty next one what's our next one we

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,480
have

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:08,240
pack alrighty

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,560
pack so pack is

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,839
made with godot like some of the other

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,359
games that we

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,040
went through last week and don't forget

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,160
the godot

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,480
conference just ran recently too

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
um

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,680
go.com that was it there we go youtube

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,960
this is it on youtube so if this isn't

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,960
one good way to get into

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,839
gaming what is this this is go.com so

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,200
um the reason i'm talking about go.con

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,480
is because this game

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,839
here pack is

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,520
built in godot it's pretty cool

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,119
this is another puzzle game this looks

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,599
like fun

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,200
right there's a physics based game with

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,119
some interesting mechanics

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,800
you're preparing for an upcoming rocket

00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,599
launch and you have the most important

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,440
job of all

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,440
unpacking boxes wow is game off official

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,240
uh what do you mean is what game off

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,839

are we talking about did you about game

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,560
are you talking about global game jam

00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,599
[Applause]

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,119

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,640
is currently running at the moment

actually

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,599
so if you haven't got involved get

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,599
involved in game jam

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,960
oh keynote speaker is yogg huh

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
hey yogg what up yogg

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,800

awesome

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,320
all right so let's run the game

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,599
basically we've gotta unpack boxes using

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,839
physics

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,839
let's be fun zoom in a little here we go

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,119
let's start at level one

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,160
you must pack these into these boxes oh

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,240
okay

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,240
let's start with the buttons okay

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,720
pause reset

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,040
start okay let's start with the start

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
button

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:37,280
press start okay wow

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,520
just wow it just

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,280
just worked so items need a little

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,680
encouragement to get them into the boxes

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
hide the red cell to enable the red

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,359
conveyor belt

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,359
start

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,440
highlight the red oh you know what i

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,440
think it might just turn

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,800
that doesn't work i thought it might

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:21,839
have something to do with it

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:21,839
okay so highlight the red oh

00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:32,449
[Music]

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,960
got 15 days to launch we're going to

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,960
hurry up

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,920
left

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:53,920
left click

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,920
this is crazy look at it okay

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,680
left click is to select this out

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,839
there'll be a grid of cells at the

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,400
bottom of the screen used to

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,400
controls okay

00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:12,319
[Music]

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,319
ah there we go that's okay cool

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:22,079
stop this is it down the bottom here

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,319
oh you're a natural sweet

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,319
okay there can be more than one so hard

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,839
so only powder machine with the timeline

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,839
slider is above it

00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,969
[Music]

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,760
nice job next

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,200
you won't always need all cells on

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,160
highlighted

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,599
all cells you won't always need all

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,800
cells unhide cells

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,800
with the right click okay

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:16,349
so we don't need the first one

00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,349
[Music]

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:27,839
wow just well oh i messed it up

00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,079
[Music]

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
okay

first one we need the yellow to drop

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,160
off which means both of them would go

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,760
that way just like the yellow to drop

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:16,559
and go

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:31,839

the left stick oh we can use a

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,839
controller for this one

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,599
i actually bought a controller so that

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,520
we can try out any games that have

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,760
controller

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,720
capabilities all right gamepad

00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,000
recommended

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,760
cool jump swing and fly

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,520
through unique landscape of floating

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,000
ships and platforms from a once

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
functioning civilization still guided by

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
vigilant robots

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,079
great fight robots on each stage gather

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,720
enough scrap from boxes barrels

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,800
and the robots to repair power and power

00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,520
your ship as it propels you

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,760
ever upwards towards the moon there's a

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,800
lot of like

00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,640
getting you to the moon

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,040
it kind of makes sense that the game is

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,440
like

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:09,839
called moonshot so lots of just meant

00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,839
sweet let's just make it go to the moon

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,040
okay skyjack oh this is looking cool

00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:25,119
you've crashed landed among unexpected

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,960
okay collect 30 scraps to repair your

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,760
trip and continue the moon mission okay

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,760
i've got the controller

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,839
okay so

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,839
wow

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:19,839
i missed it um

00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,559
okay

00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,559
oh you just like keep jumping whoa

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,880
the machines are ruined the moon

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,839
continues to elude your grass

00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,839
okay do it again

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,400
like where's the junk that i'm

00:52:46,800 --> 00:53:01,839
collecting now i don't understand where

00:52:48,400 --> 00:53:01,839
the junk is

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,839
um

00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:29,839
you can jump

00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:45,760
it's actually quite hard to control

00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,359
because as you like slice something so

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:57,040
you move

00:53:49,359 --> 00:54:01,200
quite a lot and you just like slide off

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,200
it's actually quite difficult to control

00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:15,119
it's a unity game it's good failure

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:19,040
your machine recommendations are ruined

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,440
let's try again all right let's do it

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,839
i like the controller um support though

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,839
it's really cool

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:39,839

00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:13,839

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,839
i like swinging here at the same time

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:39,440
i was not expecting something it was

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,839
crazy this is not

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,200
planets into a black hole

00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:45,280
export the planet special effects to

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,440

01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,160
phaser and javascript

01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,400

on this one

01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:35,839
oh gravity

01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,839
opposite to the way you think it would

01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,839
go

01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,839
falling planets

01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,760
okay so it's actually

01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:19,200
so that's the way you want it to go

01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,119
yeah okay so that's weird so you think

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,240
that line would be the pool cue but it's

01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:27,039
not

01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:27,039
i think that line is the way it's gonna

01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,839
go

01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:48,480

01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,799
a glitch right

01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,599
why is the earth so hard to get into a

01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,599
black hole

01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,160
that's what i'm saying like i'm

01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,599
surprised space is even moving

01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,520
considering oh great considering the

01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,119
fact that there is no gravity in space

01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:00,079
and therefore there's nothing to move

01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,079
these planets around

01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:06,480
this black hole is right behind me

01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,760
oh great i just shot myself into the

01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,760
black hole again oh come on

01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:15,170

01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:32,799
ah why is the black hole keep moving

01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,039
this one is frustrating

01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,039
okay

01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,720
boom bang

01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,000
there's no gravity yes i know i know

01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:49,599
there's no gravity in space

01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,599
where's the black hole right there

01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:01,599
oh whatever that was stupid

01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:03,680
this is actually really hard

01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,359
the game is rigged i know you're just

01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,039

01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:23,780
[Music]

01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,280
final score 1040.

01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,280
wow

01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,720

all right next on what have we got goona

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,280
is another puzzle game i like these

01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:59,200
puzzle games puzzle games are good fun

01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:02,480
all right give me a puzzle game

01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,480
okay ooh pretty

01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,920
try to tackle the vast challenge of

01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,119
terraforming the moon by shooting

01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,559
genetically engineered super slime at it

01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:16,400
to multiply

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:18,640
the moon whoa

01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,000
the earth is becoming uninhabitable the

01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,480
governments of the world

01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,560
are down to one drastic option follow

01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,560
the advice of mad scientists and spread

01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,279
genetically engineered super slime on

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,359
the moon

01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,960
that they will claim or terraform it

01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,799
into a utopia

01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,080
your job is to shoot the slimes from the

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,880
ship according to the scientist

01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,560
instructions

01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,759
good luck wow just

01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:46,000
just wow it looks fun though

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,000
super slime another unity game

01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:54,080
so this is a unity game

01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,799
and apparently it's pretty challenging

01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,799
i like the music

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:04,560
type grow enough goo to win

01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,279
restart by clicking here start getting

01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,319
hit

01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,279
to win this level to go in place to go

01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,849
in the center

01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,849
[Music]

01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,560
sweet next level a one

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,159
the objectives of the powerpoint each

01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,120
set by ensuring the correct population

01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:26,159
of each terrible

01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:29,920
glute is reached every two

01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:33,520
cycles the goo expands one tile in every

01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,359
direction as space permits but dies off

01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,759
when surrounded by six or more

01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,759
gurus

01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,080
including itself okay

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:49,839
okay so we need 12 of red

01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:03,840
that work oh

01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,840
okay next level

01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,000
permanent once it grows somewhere it is

01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:12,239
there for good

01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,239
oh it's death okay

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:20,880
xp every cycle the goo expands one tile

01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:24,159
up and down as space permits okay

01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,159
so i need eight of those

01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:31,840
i need some quickly stuff i'm gonna use

01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,840
some cautious

01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,159
i'm not gonna get this one i needed

01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:42,400
eight of them

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,600
hit play again okay so that's not too

01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,360
bad because one two

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,360
three four five six seven

01:10:47,600 --> 01:11:02,000
it has to go there this one

01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,000
there we go

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,520
like does it grow enough no it can't

01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,640
grow enough

01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:14,640
before time run out okay

01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,719
so the green needs to be close up there

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,719
and the prickly stuff can go there and

01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:22,239
that's gonna go

01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,239
there that's the only spot that can go

01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,120
because yeah the red takes over

01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:36,000
oh one away that's so annoying okay play

01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,040
again

01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:44,159
okay blue yeah

01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:44,159
red there

01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,840
you know i stopped growing the green the

01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:09,840
greens gotta go

01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:09,840
there i think

01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,480
okay so the green doesn't grow

01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,199
maybe the green's going

01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,920
up there and then the red's gonna go

01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,920
like that

01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:37,840
the red just takes over and just kills

01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,840
everything

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,159
that has to go there i can't go anywhere

01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,920
else

01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,679
this stuff is cautious we used to go

01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,760
like

01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:59,199
there and then the road goes there and

01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,199
then they overtake one another

01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,840
there we go that'll probably work

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,440
all right how did that not work oh

01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,360
maybe they've just got to go like right

01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:16,159
on top of one another

01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,840
just like the green there and then the

01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,840
blue goes there

01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,840
why is the green not growing

01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,679
green needs to be oh i get it

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,360
the green needs to like go like

01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,120
somewhere in the middle here

01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,120
so it's got double the amount of space

01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,440
and now it needs to go there so it slows

01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,440
down

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,120
it's actually really difficult

01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,840
there we go

01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,040
oh what

01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:15,840
play again okay there

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,000
okay we got it this time

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,280
oh it's gonna work

01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,719
oh no

01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:33,199
[Music]

01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,199
why

01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:43,840
maybe we can grow the red there

01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,880
yeah okay it's not going to grow anymore

01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,880
than that

01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,080
okay that's annoying

01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,600
okay play again let's try the right

01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,600
there

01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,760
typical just why is it so hard

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:14,719
okay that should get it

01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:17,199
all right oh yeah

01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,199
less

01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:25,840
okay what about if we put it like there

01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,840
this may work

01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,649
no

01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:40,649
[Music]

01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:58,480
[Music]

01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,480
yeah now the blue can't grow

01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,840
yeah okay that's annoying

01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:24,239
some stupid little trick to this

01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,239
this could work

01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,719
no no this is really hard why is it so

01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,480
hard

01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:41,840
obviously i put the blue there already

01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,840
oh there's two lines for that

01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:51,510
okay so we're used up there

01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:51,510
[Music]

01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,840
restart okay okay

01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:14,480
because we know blue's gonna go there

01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,480
anyway

01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,199
why doesn't it give us a hint for

01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,199
anything else

01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:32,880
oh it might work

01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,880
just takes over

01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:45,840
can't get sick to three to grow

01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,120

01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,120
quicker

01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:14,560
yeah time

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,480
i don't know if there's a way to

01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,760
actually win

01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:27,840
i'm assuming it would be this seems

01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:27,840
really hard for level two

01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,840
hmm

01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:48,449
[Music]

01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,640

01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,000
okay

01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,239
i know right it's it's fun it's just i

01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,560
need more

01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,840
space i need more things to think about

01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,760
all right let's go

01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:16,960
to the green

01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:20,000
worm alrighty

01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,159
moon kind

01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,600
well the green worm is what it's called

01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,440
um his username

01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,800
there's his name but moonkind is the

01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,840
name of the game

01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,280
take part in this 700 year long travel

01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,600
through interstellar space

01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,040
your ship isn't made of metal but is the

01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,920
moon itself

01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:40,000
and all you and all your personnel

01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,199
inside the moon base are the only humans

01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,679
left in the universe

01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:44,800
oh my gosh violently propelled out of

01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,400
the solar system

01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,560
surviving the void will require

01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,400
determination ingenuity and strong

01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:54,719
management management build factory oh

01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,840
basically it's sim city on the moon

01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,840
sweet let's go

01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:05,840
let's do it sim city on the moon

01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,280
this is gonna be interesting

01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:20,159
sim city all right

01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:23,199
let's start sunlight

01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,199
i was at the sunlight

01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,280
it has brought life to our planet and

01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,000
soon will bring nothing more than total

01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,000
annihilation

01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,920
so earth control center just called we

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,760
have an emergency what now

01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,159
solo sensors are going crazy everything

01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,600
points to a premature

01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:43,040
assignment last estimation said we had

01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,199
20 years left

01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,960
there's been unusual solar eruptions and

01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:50,000
it's getting worse

01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,520
how long until the supernova 10 minutes

01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,679
there's still billions of people on

01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,440
earth so we need to do something quickly

01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,639
with all india

01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,800
is the solar shield operational we've

01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,239
just started testing it fantastic power

01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,000
it up maximum strength it's the only

01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:07,040
shot we'll have let's go

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,600
uh let's hope this theory holds up oh

01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,320
wow

01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,960
they put a shield around the moon so

01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,560
this is it

01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,880
need to make an announcement this is an

01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,280
emergency broadcast of site manager

01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,440
dear citizens of the moon this is the

01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:21,040
worst thing we could have imagined

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,120
many of you have noticed the shield

01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,120
above your head the sun is about to go

01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,360
supernova the entire solar system

01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,040
including earth is about to be destroyed

01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,639
we will be protected but we don't have

01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,520
enough time to bring more people from

01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,639
earth

01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,480
brace yourselves may god help us we must

01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,600
take shelter the sun could explode any

01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:41,199
moment

01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:44,639
this is the last time i see our room

01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,639
whoa this is really dark

01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:50,239
oh my gosh the sun just went supernova

01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,239
wow

01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:01,199
oh my gosh the solar system just got

01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,199
destroyed

01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,199
the shield engineer did a great job we

01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,120
may be alive i don't see her

01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:09,520
earth control signal has stopped may

01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,840
they rest in peace

01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,440
status report i want to know where we

01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,520
are our seller's

01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,120
sensors seem to get we've been propelled

01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,960
out of the solar system we're sailing

01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:22,239
into a void at roughly

01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,520
700 000 kilometers an hour

01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:26,560
it seems like we're heading straight

01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,560
into another star

01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,040
we should be near enough to move another

01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:37,280
planet in about

01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,700
750 years we'll survive

01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,360
we'll rebuild humanity on the moon

01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,840
[Music]

01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,679
i think we received a shot a stock

01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,360
shipment last month

01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:50,030
and show you the controller let me burn

01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,440
it up oh wow

01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:55,600
[Music]

01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:57,600
well it's a year 2150

01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,239
and the earth is destroyed this looks

01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,239
complicated

01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,760
this is the calendar the top most bar is

01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:05,520
showing how far we are from the next

01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,639
solar system this is our current

01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,400
resource stock water energy and material

01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,520
this is the population we're tracking

01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,880
the number and mood of our citizens

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,639
they're all happy at the moment i don't

01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,080
know why they're happy our home just got

01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,760
destroyed and we're hurling into space

01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,040
at 700 000 kilometers an hour and

01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,480
they're happy

01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,639
we should build some production

01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,320
buildings if we want to survive 500

01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,719
years

01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,120
we've all been dead in 500 years we're

01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:33,520
dead in like 100 years

01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,719
we're in this we're in the building menu

01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,840
okay build

01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:40,520
whoa we need one of each

01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:49,120
should be enough for now so we need a

01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:51,199
geothermal plant

01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,480
now that the construction plan is

01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:54,320
clearly have to wait

01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,600
shouldn't we build more we don't have

01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:57,360
enough working age

01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,440
citizens to run another production

01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,159
building empty factories aren't

01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,520
productive

01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:04,400
the construction will take time we

01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,960
should start waiting we should start

01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,960
waiting

01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:14,560
wow resources are going down this is

01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:14,560
like speeding things up in sim city it's

01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,719
hilarious

01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:21,760
ah it got to the end of well it took a

01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,760
few years to build

01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,520
basic needs okay they're comfortable

01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,120
we've got some great culture and they're

01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,159
okay they're hopeful

01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:45,840
wow populations going up how the heck

01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:45,840
do we have 67 000 people on the moon

01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,520
an ice melting plant

01:24:51,600 --> 01:25:00,080
okay mining facilities

01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:02,000
i don't have any more resources now

01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,440
okay as it tells me how much each of

01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,760
things

01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,920
oh i accidentally built three german

01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,360
geothermal plants

01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,120
but that's what happened i was like why

01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:16,000
don't we have a race why don't we have

01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:19,280
any water and materials

01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,280
oh we're gonna run out

01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,040
okay good that was lucky our materials

01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,480
never going up hey mr richard how are

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,800
you

01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,480
the resources in stock are not enough to

01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,880
properly sustain the entire population

01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:38,000
and action is required to avoid

01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,000
certain shortages

01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:43,920
wow we do nothing well we can lower the

01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,960
population

01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,960
that's terrible

01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,520
well we can ration people

01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,679
i think we're just gonna have to russian

01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,679
people

01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,560
you decide to artificially reduce the

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:09,840
population

01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:09,840
that's terrible

01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,920
what the heck i have to make some really

01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,400
hard decisions

01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,320
i'm great except i just had to decide

01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,199
whether i kill off half the population

01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,440
on my moon

01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:26,719
or reduce their hope and culture

01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:29,360
and comfort this is like tough decisions

01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,360
right here

01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:34,960
there's not enough workers there's not

01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,360
enough resources oh what is going on

01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,239
i know it's really bad i don't know what

01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:41,280
to do

01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:41,280
i feel terrible

01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:54,000
what do i do

01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,000
oh you can destroy the building okay

01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,159
okay

01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,840
okay these are working correctly now

01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,840
storage is full

01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:19,440
[Music]

01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:20,960
okay now we're going back up

01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,440
the production is good we don't enough

01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,639
people save them all by destroying them

01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:27,920
well i didn't have enough

01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:30,880
workers on them

01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,880
which is annoying

01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:35,760
this is like really really crazy

01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,560
i'm not sure what to do

01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:51,020
oh something's under construction

01:27:47,770 --> 01:27:51,020
[Music]

01:27:53,920 --> 01:28:01,840
correctly what's that control

01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,840
center one

01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:15,840
well there's nearly a hundred thousand

01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:15,840
people on the moon

01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:29,840
what i do

01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,080
we don't have enough geothermal mass

01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,840
why is this bread

01:28:46,880 --> 01:29:01,120
it's costing that much

01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,120
increase storage

01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,840
how many things i got

01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,920
why are there so many mining facilities

01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,520
i think i accidentally like clicked them

01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,120
all like as no way

01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:29,280
okay there we go that's a better way to

01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,280
look at it

01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,800
can we if we need some more ice soon not

01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,040
enough workers

01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,840
okay simply that sounds serious things

01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,199
have been um

01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,719
producing new citizens no control

01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:43,040
centers getting crown that tends to make

01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,199
everyone uncomfortable

01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,800
we work on your housing system upload

01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:53,040
them to your build menu i'll swear i can

01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:55,920
build houses now

01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,920
crowded okay

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:07,840
i see click on these

01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:13,920
[Music]

01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:17,760
i can stop production of certain things

01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,760
rather than destroying the building

01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:23,199
you can just stop production okay that

01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:26,020
makes more sense

01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:27,520
okay i can do that

01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:34,159
[Music]

01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:38,400
enough resources

01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:49,840
death per month has increased

01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:49,840
what do i need

01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:58,080
[Music]

01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,840
free sources

01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,120
instructions stopped because not enough

01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,840
resources

01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,520
we should stimulate the intellect with

01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,159
science or allocate some resources to

01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,159
entertainment

01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:35,120
sweet

01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:35,120
center all right and

01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:38,159
i'll research that

01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:46,480
oh okay let's let that play i've

01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,840
gotta go grab this door really briefly

01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,000
because

01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,000
this is a package i've been waiting for

01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:59,840
and i can't really do much about it

01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:59,840
back in one moment people

01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:05,440

about today i'll just bring them all up

02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:31,679
individually so we talked about

02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,679
game

02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:39,440
we talked about billy's

02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:40,000
rocket this was us trying to control the

02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:43,360
rocket to

02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:47,280
go in a certain direction fun times

02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:47,280
next one we talked about is

02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:54,000
moonshot but we literally have

02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:57,840
to use like

02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,840
puzzle stuff to shoot

02:14:58,159 --> 02:15:01,920
kind of cool right next time we looked

02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:04,719
at pack

02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,320
where another puzzle game it's like a

02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:06,800
lot of puzzle games which is like really

02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,480
cool

02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,320
this is a puzzle game we had to like

02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:11,199
sort the crates out so you could launch

02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:13,920
the rocket

02:15:11,199 --> 02:15:14,400
next song we had was sky junk which was

02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,320
really

02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:20,320
kind of fun and very hard to like figure

02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:22,719
out what to do but really really like

02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:25,199
in-depth game which is cool

02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,400
uh take paul to space and you've got

02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:29,599
macro pool

02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:32,159
hey there's a botnet how are you uh

02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:33,440
guna so essentially another puzzle

02:15:32,159 --> 02:15:33,920
there's a lot of positive games on this

02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:37,199
one

02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,199
you have to use this special slime to

02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:43,520
terraform the moon

02:15:39,199 --> 02:15:46,880
one moon kind another apocalyptic one

02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:48,079
where the earth has been destroyed by

02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:49,599
the sun and we're now floating on the

02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:50,960
moon it's essentially simcity for the

02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:54,079
moon

02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,040
then we've got moon jump where you push

02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:57,440
your moon around

02:15:55,040 --> 02:16:00,159
the galaxy all around the solar system

02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:03,040
all around space to get to the portal

02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:04,239
then we've got the moon anarchists use

02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,840
the moon to shoot

02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:09,679
other moons and just

02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:11,280
shoot many moons of planets it's really

02:16:09,679 --> 02:16:11,920
random it's kind of like space invaders

02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:13,760
with the moon

02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,840
this one was really cute this platform

02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:17,840
again which we just finished playing

02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,599
uh yumi and the dark knight so your

02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,159
platform along you like

02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,840
uh level up your character with jumping

02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:25,520
and um

02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,280
and different lives and things like that

02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,760
and you gotta get to

02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:30,400
the doorway which is really cool and

02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:34,240
then

02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:36,319
finally we went through orbit so orbit

02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:39,000
was the one we just did where cyberpunk

02:16:36,319 --> 02:16:42,479
is finally released in the year 2020

02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:45,519
2244 and you had to try and get the moon

02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:46,960
to rotate or orbit another planet it was

02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:50,000
actually quite difficult

02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:53,200
don't forget the github game off um

02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:55,280
if you haven't ever seen the

02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,559
moon jump and the link one yeah yeah you

02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,719
like those two yeah

02:16:56,559 --> 02:16:59,920
cool um so if you haven't ever seen the

02:16:58,719 --> 02:17:02,399
github game off this

02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:04,080
is the website um so we host it on the

02:17:02,399 --> 02:17:07,599
h.o platform

02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:09,760
the game of runs every year in november

02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:12,240
if you can't wait that long and you want

02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:15,439
to get involved in game dev

02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:18,559
um as we mentioned in our

02:17:15,439 --> 02:17:22,080
session last week there is js 13k

02:17:18,559 --> 02:17:24,719
games which is a

02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:26,080
game competition there's more prizes up

02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:27,439
for grabs in this one too

02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:28,559
the other one doesn't the game off

02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:29,920
doesn't have prizes it's kind of like

02:17:28,559 --> 02:17:32,240
bragging rights

02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:33,840
this one you have to create a game in 13

02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:35,359
kilobytes or less has to be written in

02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,479
javascript a bit more constraints here

02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:38,080
on this one

02:17:36,479 --> 02:17:40,760
as a couple of people brought up in the

02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:43,599
chat we have the

02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:45,200
global game jam which is happening at

02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,120
the moment

02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,120
which is really awesome and then the

02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:51,519
other ones we looked at last week

02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,599
were how to actually get involved in

02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:57,760
game dev so if you want to learn more

02:17:53,599 --> 02:18:00,399
there's some unity learning there is um

02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:02,160
unreal learning which is really cool and

02:18:00,399 --> 02:18:03,760
we brought up the student developer pack

02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:06,000
because if you have the github student

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:09,599
developer pack you get unity

02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,559
premium for free so that's exciting

02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,040
now we did mention as same as last week

02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:14,880
that

02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:16,559
what we want to do with these open

02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:18,240
source friday streams is continue the

02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:20,880
