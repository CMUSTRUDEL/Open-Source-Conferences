all right welcome welcome everybody

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,440
welcome to open source friday uh i am b

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,839
dougie uh if you don't know who i am by

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,279
now

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
i mean you probably this is your first

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,960
time which is fine because i think uh

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
your first time here watching a stream

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,280
on github you should definitely hit the

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
follow button

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
because we just had a security lab

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,160
session

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,520
if you didn't see that that sort of uh

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,680
pair programming they were doing

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,519
uh definitely check out the the vod as

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,720
well uh but today

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,960
we're not talking about security we're

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
talking about octoprint and we have a

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,599
special guest

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,320
which is uh i was going to call you full

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,000
soul but um do you do you answer bye

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,600
i answer my food poodle yeah i answered

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,239
by foosel hi

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
yes but i also answered by uh gina

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,960
hoyske

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,000
which is usually an absolute mouthful

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,960
for anyone not

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
uh not not raised in germany to speak to

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,399
say so i'm absolutely fine with just

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
being called gina or foosel

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
okay excellent um actually what's the uh

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
the history behind your your github

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
handle

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
oh that was actually like my nickname

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,120
even before github existed

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,960
though it was like yeah i i was sitting

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
there at one night and i needed a new

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
nickname and i

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
was heavily into reading um i don't know

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,960
if you remember the user-friendly

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,640
webcomic

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,439
it had this little thing called the dust

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,880
puppy like and it was made of a ball of

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
lint and all that

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
and the german word for lint is fossil

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,560
and then there's also the metasyntactic

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
variable fubar

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
and that kind of like was put together

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
in my head and somehow i ended up with

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320
that

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
a lot of people think it has something

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
to do with i don't know

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,960
some kind of sql

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,000
a dialect and in german it also

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,720
sounds very much like the word for booze

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
but uh i don't drink so that is

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,000
definitely also another connection there

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,360
what's the word for booze but with an

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,520
with a you you have to really

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
pay attention for the pronunciation yeah

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
yeah i mean yep i mean i was

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
i was expecting to use this nickname

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,600
primarily in like more english-speaking

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,680
areas so most people would not see the

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,439
the connection there uh so i figured

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
okay this is going to work fine but when

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,240
i'm

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,759
on german events or such and introduce

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
myself by my nick sometimes people look

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
at me funny and then i always say no not

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
like that stuff

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,000
with double o and always

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,360
in in in smaller case in lower case okay

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
yes that's uh i'm actually i personally

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
prefer the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
uh the lowercase b as well for my name

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
and then

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
the yo is always capitalized because i

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,959
want that to be enunciated

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,400
that that is the second part of my first

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
name b dougie yo

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
but actually uh thanks for the uh the

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,840
the the lesson on

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,519
how to say booze and and german but also

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
uh introducing us your your

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
all your names uh but you're here not to

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
tell us about your name you're here to

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,319
tell us about

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,360
um this cool project uh which is

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
octoprint

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
um so i guess do you want to give us a

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400
brief history of octoprint and like

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
where it came from

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
yeah sure so uh first of all what is

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
octoprint uh it already says it there

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
it's the snappy web interface for your

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,720
3d printer

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,640
and it is basically like a cross of

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,000
a baby monitor and a remote control for

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
your 3d printer

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
i started this project over eight years

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,599
ago and back then when you bought

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,120
yourself a 3d printer

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,040
or printed yourself a 3d printer um

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
yeah you still had to tether it to your

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
pc all the time for it to work and do

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
its job and all that

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
the the more these days more common

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
approach where you put

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,879
the files that you want to print on an

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,159
sd card and insert it into the printer

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
that was more like the

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,360
out of more like the the the uh how do

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,959
you say

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,560
um the exception than the rule and

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
so i had my printer sitting here in my

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,360
office uh my shiny new one that i bought

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,959
in late 2012 and it was producing noise

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
and was producing fumes and

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,680
producing this this for hours on end and

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
tying up my pc and i couldn't game on

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
that i couldn't work on that in the time

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
and that was when i decided okay

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,760
i need a solution for this i just want

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
to so the raspberry pi had come out in

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,760
this year

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,480
which is like a tiny computer this size

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
costs like

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,560
40 bucks or something um and i figured

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,360
there must be some way that i can just

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
throw something on one of these things

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
and

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
let that take the place of my pc and

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,799
talk to the printer

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
and stream the job to it and also let me

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,800
monitor it from

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,199
from afar yeah turns out there wasn't

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
so i sat down over my christmas location

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
and implemented such a thing just to

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
scratch my own what year was this uh

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,400
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,560
late 2012. so it's been a while yeah

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,639
yeah almost 10 years yeah almost yeah

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
well we just passed the eight year mark

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,960
so i'm not sure

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,479
what i will do in in 2022 then but

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,080
i will probably find some way to

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,800
celebrate

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,440
but yeah so i sat down wrote what i

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
needed to write

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,320
and actually build up on on an existing

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,240
piece of open source software called

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
cura which

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
is actually a so-called slicer so

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,240
something that you use before you

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,840
actually print something to turn the 3d

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,039
model into the stuff that the printer

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,479
can actually print

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,840
but it also had a machine communication

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
layer inside so that you could

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
directly print from cura and cura was

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240
written in python i already knew python

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,600
so i figured hey i understand

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,199
this language i can just maybe use this

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
communication layer and then build

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,120
something on top

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,320
and this is how things happened so i

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,039
built something i

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
quickly had a web interface i then also

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,800
found a way to attach a webcam so that i

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,360
could actually remotely monitor

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
what was going on on the print bed and

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,039
then by mid-january or

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
rather early january when my vacation

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,120
ended i was like okay

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
that's done i'm finished that was a nice

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
run now i'm returning to my

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
world in the corporate uh software

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,919
development

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,880
world and figured that was that and then

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
suddenly all

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,319
from all across the world people started

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,199
messaging me and opening issues on my

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,960
github

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,360
repository that i had created for this

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,240
thing and we're like hey awesome can you

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
make it do that

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,440
and i'm having problems with this kind

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
of printer and maybe can you also

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,880
implement this and that and whatnot

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
yeah uh too long didn't reach suddenly i

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,639
had a really really

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,400
really really big open source project on

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
my hands that kept growing and growing

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800
and growing

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,360
and i reduced my job to 80

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
to have one week dedicated per week one

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,120
day dedicated per week to work on it and

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,319
that still wasn't enough

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,919
and yeah at some point said

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
thankfully some company approached me

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
and said hey do you want to do this full

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
time

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,000
and i was like yes please and

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,919
uh so in 2014 what company was this

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
uh there was a 3d printer company or

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
rather it was a it was a

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,280
you would you could probably call it a

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
technology company a spanish

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,759
technology company i think they don't

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,039
exist anymore

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,440
and they also had 3d printers in there

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,120
in their portfolio and were interested

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,400
in simply just growing that

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,240
that part and so i

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,800
said yeah well sure perfect and so they

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,800
hired me full full-time and i was just

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
here continue to be here in my home

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
office working on octoprint full-time

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
and yeah then two years later they ran

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,360
out of money and

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,880
i had to find another way to continue

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,680
funding and that was when i turned to

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,880
crowdsource

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,520
crowdfunding so since

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
actually since five years now for five

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,000
years now

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:44,080
almost to the day um

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,199
and uh yeah so octoprint

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,280
really big project used by many and

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,879
with one full-time developer who's

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
actually able to

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,960
fund her work on it through crowdfunding

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,479
which is absolutely amazing and which i

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,879
never expected would happen

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
yeah a that's amazing and uh santoshi in

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,919
the chat just mentioned like wow that

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,840
what uh that's a dream for many for you

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,000
to be able to build this project

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,280
to get adoption uh it seems like you got

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
the i guess the

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,319
it's open source but like in the

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
business world product market fit

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,360
of like you've solved a problem that

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,879
people wanted

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,840
um and then super awesome that uh

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
the spanish company was able to uh

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,879
employ

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,720
your efforts uh but then you're able to

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,120
find i don't know if it was like a

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
perfect transition to do crowdsourcing

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
for the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
or crowdfunding for the project or was

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,039
it like

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,279
was it there was was there some friction

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
into being able to

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,680
move from being paid to then wait for

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
payment to come through through

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,760
contributors well the friction that was

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,240
there was primarily

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
rooted in the fact that this is simply

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,760
not something that

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,040
is even remotely considered in the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,160
german tax code

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
okay so i live in germany and the fact

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,800
that i

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,680
work and give the fruits of my work away

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
for free

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,160
yeah and people still give me money for

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
it that is something that simply does

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,800
not compute in this country

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
so um we are still trying to figure this

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
out but

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
we'll get there eventually how does it

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,640
work with um like would that does uh

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,240
germany participate the the vit

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,399
yeah that is really complicated yeah i

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
this is also something that is still in

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,920
in the process of being figured out

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
let's just say that if i had known how

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,200
much red tape was associated with doing

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,040
something like this in germany i would

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,959
probably not have done it

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,720
but now that i'm doing it i'm simply

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,399
holding on for dear life and hope and

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
hoping for the best i also have a really

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,320
good um

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
uh tax consultant uh behind me so

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,000
excellent yeah

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
this is some like the first week that i

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
started with this crowdfunding and

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
started to look into it i

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,160
just called her up she's the she's the

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
wife of a former um

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
fellow student uh someone i went to

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,839
university with and i was like

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
i i think i need a text consultant and

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,200
she was like yep we got you

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,640
excellent yeah that's uh

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,800
yeah was really helpful yeah so uh i'm

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
curious to learn more about octoprint um

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,640
i don't have a 3d printer myself

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
uh i've almost bought one like every

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,480
year since they've been out but i'm like

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
do i need one more hobby like i've

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
definitely got enough stuff in my garage

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,160
that

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,519
i just couldn't really convince the wife

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,399
that this is something that i should be

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,880
working on

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,480
but um i'm looking forward to seeing

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
what you have in store of octoprim

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
to maybe i can convince myself that

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
maybe my next birthday

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,800
i can sort of uh write the check and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,079
have a 3d printer

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,399
sent to my house totally if you do so

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,920
please uh give me a call or or ping

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,640
first because there's a lot of crap out

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,600
there that you do not want to buy

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,959
yeah um okay so we already heard that it

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
is basically uh

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
a crossover baby monitor and a remote

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
control

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,040
which means that uh maybe you should you

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,240
i'm just going to show this maybe on

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,480
on an actual printer you just have to

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,399
are you gonna share your screen share my

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
screen so this is octoprint currently

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,480
with the dark theme actually which is a

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,079
plugin

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
developed from the community i'll get to

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
that in a bit

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
but um basically what you have here is

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,040
you have a web interface you can see the

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
temperatures here

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,399
of the printer so 3d printers or rather

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
fdm 3d printers which is the class of 3d

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,920
printers that occupants targets you can

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
you can imagine those are basically like

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,440
a

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,760
like um like a hot glue gun on a 3d

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,720
gantry so you can move it in x y and you

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
can also move it up

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
and you can also make it squeeze out

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,760
glue it's not glue but molten plastic

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,880
but you get the idea

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,160
and this is how you build up stuff so

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,079
somewhere there there are heating

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,079
elements usually these days you have at

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
least one in the so-called hot end so

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,279
the stuff where the

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
weather molten plastic comes out and

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,440
also the heated bed

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200
where you build stuff on because a lot

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
of plastics do not like it when they

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
cool down too fast and then they

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
start to shrink and start to detach and

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
so you want to keep them a bit

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,800
warm and cozy from beneath as well so

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,200
you can get an overview over the

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,440
temperatures here i can also just

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,320
quickly maybe heat the hot end up to 80

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,160
degrees here and

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,200
centigrade i should maybe add for the

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
american crowd here

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,079
and um you will now see that the printer

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,040
is actually now heating up

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,000
the nozzle it's still a bit far to the

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,519
right of the graph here

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,600
but you can see it there that it's

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
rising and

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
uh yeah you also see the printer's

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,639
operation you see a bunch of stuff that

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,839
is currently not filled here because no

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,760
print job is running

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,160
in theory you can also disconnect from

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,959
it here and connect to some other other

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,440
thing and you have a bunch of files here

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,200
that you can just select for printing

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,360
and go ahead with them basically

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,639
you can also create folders if you need

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,920
some

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,560
need some more structure here and then

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,120
you also have this tab where you have a

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
webcam

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,760
embedded so you can make it move now i

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,240
just hold it on the x y

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,200
axis i can quickly move the head over

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,839
there

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,519
move the bed over there stuff like this

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,200
yeah

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
there's also the g-code viewer which

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
currently still needs to load the file

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,240
that i just selected there you

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,360
go and that also allows you to

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
go through the files that you want to

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
print layer by layer and verify that

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
they are actually looking like you

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,519
expect them to look

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
you can also see what is actually going

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,600
back and forth

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,320
between the printer and octoprint so

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,560
sometimes you need this for debugging

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,120
stuff but also just for more

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,800
power user level kind of tasks for

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
example

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
and then there's also the time lapse

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,680
feature because i figured if there is a

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
webcam

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,440
and i can take snapshots why not have it

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,360
take snapshots every

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,519
i don't know 10 seconds or so and then

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
build up time lapses that

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,639
actually show the object growing from

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
the bed

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
and this is also where plugins that i

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,160
already mentioned come in again

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,079
because um brett hawker zhang

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,839
aka formal lurker from the community

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,360
actually took this feature

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
and turned it into something completely

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,399
and utterly awesome called octolapse

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
which not only

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
takes a picture every 10 seconds or so

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,880
but

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,800
sinks the the point where the picture is

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,480
taken with the movement of the head so

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,079
that you can make it look like the head

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
is always at the same point and the

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
object is just magically appearing out

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,519
of thin air

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,240
or you can make it so that it is looks

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,160
like it's just

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
moving in circles and the object is

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,839
moving out of thin air so there are some

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,959
really really artistic and awesome

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,519
time lapses that you can create that way

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,560
and yeah so this is the basically the

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,120
core

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,480
uh of octoprint and and what it allows

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
out of the box there's also some

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
settings here

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
uh that you can uh that you so so that

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
you can fine tune some stuff how the

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,480
serial connection works and all that

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,040
and you can also install plugins this

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,079
way

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,519
so we have a huge uh plugin repository

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,800
which i think currently has something

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,160
like 200 or maybe 240 i'm not

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,079
entirely sure uh plugins developed by

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,880
people from the community

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,639
uh maintained by them completely

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,160
separate from octoprint

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,040
and uh yeah all discoverable

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,079
in the octa print plug-in repository let

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,079
me quickly actually check oh 286 plugins

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,160
from how many different authors

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,440
oh i thought i had oh 202 so 202

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
separate like in authors

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,920
which is really awesome like there is a

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,720
there's a really huge community now that

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,160
builds stuff like automatic upload of

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,360
your timelapse to youtube

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,759
or um

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,519
controlling the gpro pins on a raspberry

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,560
pi where you have octoprint running

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,120
stuff like that so

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
there is really really nice creativity

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,680
in this community

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,600
and they just yeah so my idea there was

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,839
just i built a plug-in interface into

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,120
octoprint that allows to extend it in

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,560
various ways so

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
pretty much everything that i could

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,240
think of is an extension point so to

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,720
speak and the community went with that

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,920
and ran

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,440
with it and uh has since been turning up

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,600
really really awesome stuff

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,920
yeah i i like that um that you opened up

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
the uh the api to have plugins because

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,199
we had

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
i know you you know paulus um who is the

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,600
creator of home assistant

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,519
that was another thing he had to

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
discover with his community

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,759
and how to sort of like draw the line

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,000
between building everything versus

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
enabling or starting not enabling that's

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,279
probably empowering

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,440
uh contributors to be able to build

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,120
their own stuff yeah that is exactly the

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
reason also why i did it because i mean

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,160
on the one hand i cannot even think of

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,480
all the cool stuff that you could beat

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
but

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,639
also i cannot maintain all of it

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,480
so now i can just tell someone hey i

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
don't think this is something that

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
everyone who runs octoprint would want

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,360
to also

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,559
have bundled but maybe

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,439
a small but but but yeah but still

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,319
significant fraction so why don't you

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,559
just build it

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,079
and publish it on the plug-in repository

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,919
and then everyone wants it can just pick

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,360
it and everyone who doesn't want it

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,760
won't have to

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
yeah facebook's potentially caused by it

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
or something like that

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,679
so yeah i'm really glad that i put this

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,919
plugin system in there because it has

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
saved me a ton of grief i've also used

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,320
it in the past

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,000
to when when i had some bug in a release

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,000
that i could not easily solve with a

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,840
hotfix because for example it influenced

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
the software update mechanism which i'm

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,120
currently showing

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,520
on screen then i just could roll out a

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
really small plug-in that fixed the bug

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,640
so people could just install the plug-in

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
and afterwards octoprint was patched

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,480
enough so that they could

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
get to a fixed version stuff like that

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,799
so this is really powerful

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,240
also plug-ins are an absolute godsend

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,120
with regards to

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,919
working around problems with the various

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,799
really

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
weird printers that have sprung up on

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,720
the market now

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,320
that yeah do whatever they want

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,080
basically when it comes to protocol

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,080
interpretation so you can just write a

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
plugin that rewrites whatever goes

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
through the serial line transparently

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,400
for octoprint so octoprint thinks it's

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
talking to an

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,240
actual normal behaved printer and the

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
plugin takes care of all the translation

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,520
so can we touch on that real quick uh

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,520
just about the the

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
market for 3d printers like what

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,799
printers work with

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,080
out-of-the-box work with octoprint like

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,600
if i wanted to get started

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,200
today uh first of all only fdm printers

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,280
right now so there's this other

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,400
version or this is other common class of

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,320
printers now where

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,600
you use resin that then gets uv hardened

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,080
those are not supported by octoprint but

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,679
yeah the majority of printers that are

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
currently sold on the market the

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
majority of three

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,799
of fdm 3d printers are i think probably

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,919
supported by octoprint i cannot say for

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,960
sure

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,960
because uh yeah it all

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,480
hinges on whether they run a firmware

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,679
which implements the defactor standard

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
protocol the proctor

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,799
the problem with the de facto standard

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320
protocol and 3d printing there is

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
neither a standard nor is there a

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240
well-defined protocol but there is

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,480
something that pretty much everyone

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
roughly does the same and this is where

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
octoprint depends on

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,760
and so there are a bunch of standard

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,799
firmwares

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,880
some of uh which you can also yeah

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,960
pretty much uses aftermarket add-ons to

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,039
your printers which might not play nice

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
with octoprint to begin with

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,360
uh things like marlin repetitive

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,919
firmware smoothie wear

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,280
reprap firmware and i'm probably

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,200
forgetting something now and

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,400
i hope someone will not throttle me for

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
that but

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
so there's a bunch of stuff and and

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,039
every single one of those are supported

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,880
and most of the printers that you can

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
get for example in the hardware store on

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,600
amazon or so they use

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,000
one of these okay but i guess my my next

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,559
question too about that the fdm printers

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
are are none of the printer suppliers

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
building

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
interfaces for their printers or is it

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,720
all

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
you're on your own open up a terminal

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,520
good luck

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,640
some of them try to but usually it

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,520
doesn't

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,280
let's say end well at least from what

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,080
i've seen over the past eight years

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,000
being a bit

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
more present in the in the in the

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,799
industry

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,880
in general they just tell you these days

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,799
they just tell you to slice whatever you

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,080
want to print throw it on an sd card and

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
throw the sd card in your printer or

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
throw it on a

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,919
usb stick and throw that in your printer

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,480
and something like remote control also

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,480
is not really

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,559
i mean there are exceptions of course

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,000
but uh the majority is still

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,600
like use an sd card us you use the usb

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,440
printer and if you're lucky as a com

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,840
as a consumer you actually also have

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,520
some usb port where you can get

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,919
the serial access that you need for

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,159
octoprint but

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
yeah depending on the vendor or under on

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,480
the manufacturer that

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,480
that then can be hit or miss so we've

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
seen a lot of problems with really cheap

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
printers

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,840
with marlin which were off of

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,840
marlins or one of the firmware versions

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,799
um like six years or so with bugs still

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,720
in there that i

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,159
actually patched myself in marlin since

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,880
then and

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,960
yeah it's it's a bit of a of a really

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
fragmented landscape that is really

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
tricky to navigate as

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,440
something like octoprint which is by the

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
way the class of software that

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
octoprints is

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
in is called host software host software

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,679
is the thing that you

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,640
use to communicate with your printer and

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
yeah this communication with printers is

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
extremely tricky

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,200
if you want to cover most of the market

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
okay

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
that's fascinating because like in my

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,080
mind like i i think that uh you know

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,600
as most software or engineer or computer

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,039
hardware is like if you wait long enough

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
stuff will improve

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,240
as the sort of people are involved in

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
the uh the system

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,280
and like i'm just kind of baffled that

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,480
it's

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,799
it's not a solved problem in the

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
industry so like i can't name any 3d

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,360
printer

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,799
manufacturers but like let's just just

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,919
draw a random one

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,919
that probably doesn't make 3d printers

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
like samsung or something like i would

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,120
assume

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,520
they know how to do computers so and

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,880
they know how to do software

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,880
why yeah so the thing is with 3d

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
printing like we orbit ftm printing like

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,200
we have it these days

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,480
it's that that all was built from the

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,080
ground up

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,280
like maybe i'm not entirely sure when

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,000
the patent expired

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,400
that all of this was based on but there

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,320
was a patent hold by i think held by

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
either stratuses or 3d systems i'm not

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,320
entirely sure which of the two it was

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,600
but that basically had the whole fdm

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,919
manufacturing process

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,039
patented which meant only hobbyists

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,720
could even do that

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,480
if they wanted in the garage and when

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,880
the patent expired

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,559
a lot of people just got got together

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,640
with an open source spirit and

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,559
tried to build these first so-called rap

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,840
rap machines from the ground up

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:16,400
and they just basically

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,440
put an industry standard file format

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,919
called g-code

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,159
which is well established in the cnc

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,440
world and is actually a nist standard

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,240
they just used this but turned it from a

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,480
file format

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,760
into a more or less specified protocol

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,679
and so you had a bunch of hobbyists who

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,240
would hack on this stuff during the

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,000
weekend and usually just make it work so

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,679
that it supported their workflow and

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,279
this is how things happened

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:48,240
and you can imagine that this led to

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,520
some quite creative solutions and also

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
quite creative

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
implementations so this is how we ended

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
up here

00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,080
and yeah there is just not that much

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,039
pressure for um for 3d printer vendors

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,440
now to change that because

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,640
let's say you are samsung samsung is not

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
actually in the field but

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
this is a good example because i can

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,000
just use this without

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,840
risking of offending anyone yeah so

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,960
let's say you're a samsung and you you

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,520
now want to

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,279
build a 3d printer and you you have you

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,919
have an idea about the mechanics already

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,520
and you have

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
have the 3d gantry and all that and you

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,320
have to extrude the design that the hot

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,240
end design and all that and you know how

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,559
to put all of this together maybe for

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,840
something as low as 200 bucks

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,440
and now you have the problem that you

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,520
also need firmer for that so what do you

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,720
do do you develop this in-house or do

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,159
you maybe just

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,840
go on github.com firmware slash marlin

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,200
and download that

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,720
yeah yeah that that makes sense and i

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,480
didn't i didn't realize the patent

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,000
issue too as well well not even an issue

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,559
because i think it's expired at this

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159
point

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,640
but i think that could also slow

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,039
progression too as well absolutely

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,159
so i i have to admit when i started on

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,200
this eight years ago

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,159
uh when i sat down one evening and just

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,159
figured out

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,360
uh well this is a serial connection it

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,840
is surely going to

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,520
be specified somewhere how hard can it

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,559
be i'll just whip up the web interface

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,200
and be done with it

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,880
i did not expect what i would find

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,559
namely that there is no standard

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
there was nothing but a wiki page that i

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,440
could actually read and this only

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
defines the commands that you can send

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,400
and it doesn't define what you get back

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,080
and things like this so this turned out

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,679
to be actually the biggest challenge of

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,760
developing octoprint

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,679
like with all all of the other

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
challenges that i had to face over the

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
years including the funding situation by

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
the way

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,600
the protocol madness is like

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,840
i think one of the things that is most

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,840
to blame for me now having gray hair

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,039
well that in genetics but um

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,880
it's yeah it's it's really insane and

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,000
frankly some days i'm surprised anything

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
works at all

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,120
yeah wow and so i real quick uh i wanted

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,559
to i want to get back to your demo and

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,880
maybe we see a hello world

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,240
um but i want to understand more of your

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
background too because you

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,840
your approach to the problem i'm

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
assuming you had experience in the

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
hardware programming side

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,799
uh to being able to solve this problem

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,000
with the

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,120
octoprint not hardware no i'm

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,600
i'm i'm i'm i mean here

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,600
only on a hobbyist level myself so i i

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,039
did a bit a bit of arduino coding and

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,039
all that in my day but

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:32,640
um primarily i am i was actually

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,720
a a java enterprise developer okay so

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
yeah i used to be a software architect

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,480
in a huge corporation

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
and ran around in a suit and all that

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,799
most of the day

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,640
consulting people on how to not do

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,240
something that they were set on doing

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,919
because it would fail and them not

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
listening to me and all that

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,320
and octoprint happened because i i found

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
myself in this job

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,320
and really wanting to just code on

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,960
something fun

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
for a change again also you have a

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
visitor

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,600
yeah i mistakenly forgot to unplug the

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,440
nintendo switch

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:11,120
so we did i guess come in

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,039
um yeah so uh and and this is my

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,600
background so i

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,320
when if you if you ever find you find

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
the itch to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,480
to to just hack around an octoprint

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
maybe maybe look around into the code

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
and all there

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,399
i've done my best over the past eight

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,559
years to make

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,559
the hints that i used to be a java

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,880
developer vanish but sometimes you still

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,960
see

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,720
variable names in camelcase for example

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,200
which are leftovers of that

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,080
okay excellent if you also mentioned

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,000
that you were

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,919
a programmer and a suit uh have you seen

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,799
the meme on twitter at the moment about

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,760
not trusting a programmer in a in a suit

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,679
i haven't

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
it's a it's not a great meme but it's a

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
funny the responses to it

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,080
it's a funny thread because uh folks are

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,760
basically ripping at the shreds but

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,760
we can move on from that um

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600
yeah i mean i personally i prefer hoodie

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,520
so

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,159
excellent and i don't know what uh

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,039
anakin's talking about with the um

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,559
with the mouse uh but actually let's

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,840
switch to your screen we can do a quick

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,120
demo and i can

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
address my my guest

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,000
uh yeah so uh where was i right plugin

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,240
manager we already did cover

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,399
uh i also said uh something about

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,399
software update mechanism so octoprint

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:29,200
is able to uh just update itself

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,480
uh it and it actually is using github

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,159
releases for that

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
um and it also can do that with plugins

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,520
so

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,799
your your plugin can wire a plug-in hook

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,600
register itself

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,240
with this software update mechanism and

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
also

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
like octoprint can provide release

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,120
channels and all that so there is

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,600
like a lot of possibility here to keep

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,279
your stuff

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,880
updated and make sure that people

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,080
actually get notified of new releases

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,200
and all that and

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,279
as far as i know this is also quiet

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,399
uh enjoyed by the plug-in authors and

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,559
also the user base

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,159
so is this all python all the plugins

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,080
created or also python as well

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,399
yeah yeah everything is pi i mean the

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,799
front end is is obviously html css

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,679
javascript and i must

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,960
add here that it is eight-year-old

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
front-end technology

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
because the downside of having a plug-in

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,640
system

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
means that i cannot just easily swap out

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
a whole technology stack anymore without

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,720
breaking everything left and right so

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,600
uh this is also the reason why octoprint

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
took uh

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,279
is still also compatible to python 2.

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,399
i don't know if you know about the whole

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,480
situation with python 2 versus 3 but

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,240
basically when python switched from

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,080
version two to three they also did a lot

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
of backwards and compatible changes to

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,080
the language

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,760
which were good and where needed but

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,960
they still broke a lot of stuff for

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,919
python two code

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,919
so it was a bit of a nightmare to port

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,559
python 2 code base over to python 3.

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,520
python 2 was declared end of life at the

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,039
first january 1st 2020 already so it

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,320
predates corona

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,279
and but

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,600
of course you cannot just with with a

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,279
pro

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
with a project that has a user base like

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,760
octoprint you cannot just say

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,600
okay uh i'm now stopping to support

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,600
python 2 as well because it is no longer

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,799
supported because that would break it on

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,840
everyone's machines

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,840
out there and it would also cause a lot

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,440
of mayhem with plug-ins because a lot of

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,320
plug-ins were also be developed

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,640
by people doing their first stuff ever

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,840
they didn't know about python 2 versus 3

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,240
so they just targeted python 2

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,559
now the plug-in was only passed two so

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,039
yeah we've had a lot of fun last year

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,640
slowly getting people to migrate yeah

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,440
but is there still some plug-ins that

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,559
are still left

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,720
out in the uh in the work

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,320
actually yes so we we even we even

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
tracked this now here on the plug-in

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,640
repository so

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,279
we have 286 plug-ins right now and 238

00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,279
of these

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
are already python 3 compatible

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,159
excellent so 50

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,240
54 a bit a bit under 50 are still

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,000
yeah not and those are probably can't

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,640
probably con be considered abandoned by

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,679
now

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,799
but uh yeah so

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,600
we saw this number this this 83

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,840
of the course of 2020 with a lot of

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,279
advertising for python 3 compatibility

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,399
and also someone writing an

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,720
update script to move existing octoprint

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,000
installations over without any downtime

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,840
and all that

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,600
we saw that move from something like

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,720
maybe 25 percent i think to this number

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,399
and this that was absolutely amazing and

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,960
exciting to see how the community really

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,360
got together and did this

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,279
yeah so we also have some stats by now

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,120
like usage stats and so you can also now

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,519
see the top 10 of the money so

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,120
which plugins are the most popular among

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,279
the user base and also which

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,480
are currently being installed like there

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,880
is no tomorrow

00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:03,200
that is also really nice yeah and

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
so what else is there to see um

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,600
yeah a ton of settings that i will

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,399
probably or should probably not go into

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,200
yet but

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,039
you can pretty much uh customize every

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,919
aspect of your print jobs here

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,360
and how they are started how they are

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,120
stopped what happens when they

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
need to get cancelled stuff like this

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,960
and you can configure the webcam stuff

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,039
and you can

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,200
add users and application keys for

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,039
party clients which there are a number

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,519
by now also there's a bunch of

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:38,000
uh native apps now for android and

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,840
uh iphone as far as i know there is

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
someone even set up something that's

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,000
called

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,880
octofarm which is like a a service which

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,799
you can install

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,039
on yours on your on your network for

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,799
example which you then can wire up a ton

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,600
of octoprint instances so if you have

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,519
one

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,039
more than one printer and each of one is

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
connected to an octoprint instance you

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,640
can just have these all connected to

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,039
your octofarm

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,640
and use that to manage them and also to

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,320
make sure that everything is all right

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,880
and make sure all of them are actually

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,720
utilized all the time and such

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
so there's some some really awesome

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,720
creativity going on there

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,080
yeah i'm curious what would um uh what

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
would sort of be the use case for

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,159
building a plug-in

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
uh because you mentioned a couple of

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,120
them passing but maybe if folks are

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
interested

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240
actually one question i have for the

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,519
chat how many of y'all are actually

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,080
using 3d printers

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,360
and if yes are you using octoprint uh do

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,159
you have any use cases that you're using

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,080
it with but

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,080
i guess going back to your question gina

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,919
um yeah what are the use cases for

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,720
plugins like what would be the reason to

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,600
reach for that

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,080
that system yeah for example a lot of

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,799
people

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,440
are interested in getting a notification

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,840
when their

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,519
print is finished to their messenger

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,039
system of choice so this is something

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,159
that you can do with a plugin for

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,440
example there are plugins for

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,559
slack for discord for telegram for

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,080
a bunch of other things then i already

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,679
mentioned that a lot of printers that

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,960
you have out there are not necessarily

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,600
well behaved when it comes to the

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,039
protocol

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
implementation this is also something

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,119
that you can solve with a plugin

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,119
you might want to make more fancy

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,960
more fancy time lapses as i already

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,079
mentioned there's also now

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,000
some uh actually also by brett hawkins

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,440
i just remembered there's also an

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,560
alternative

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,960
so something that let me let me

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,919
roll back a bit so yeah if you if you if

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,480
you want to

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,240
um print something yeah so you have to

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
have a 3d model file that you downloaded

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,480
somewhere

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,839
or you designed it yourself and now you

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,520
want to print it so first you have to

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,760
throw it in this thing called the slicer

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,599
that i already mentioned which will

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
slice it up into its layers and also

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,879
make sure that all the layers are

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,040
painted basically by the thing

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
and the thing with 3d printers is that

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,800
most of them

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,879
so far only supported straight lines so

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
if you have something like a round

00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,919
hull or something for example if you

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,280
print

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,480
a boat or or or if you printed something

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,320
like this mouse

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,760
with the end here which is a bit rounded

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920
or so then it would

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,040
not actually print a curve there but

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,200
approximate this with very short lines

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,680
and each of the short lines is a line an

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,440
actual line and a command that has to be

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,000
transmitted to the printer

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,920
over a serial line and then acknowledged

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,200
so this means that this

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,079
directly limits how fast you can print

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,839
this because

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,200
it limits how fast you can send the

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,320
stuff that needs to be printed to the

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,240
printer

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,839
and now brett sat down and said well i

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,560
can probably just

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,680
fit all these line segments with a curve

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,520
again because

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,079
some firmware actually allows you to

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,200
send just a curve command

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,599
and you did that it's called arc welder

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,599
and it reduces the file size of gcode

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
files by i don't know how many percent

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,880
it presents but it's really significant

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,160
what he has achieved there and

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,320
it has made it so much

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,640
yeah so the perform has improved the

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,440
performance of printing stuff with a lot

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,599
with lots of curves unsupported printers

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
by by so much through this because yeah

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,359
you no longer have to send

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
two million little line segments but

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:14,160
just one curve and are done

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,079
and yeah so optimizations like that

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,599
then there are also plugins that give

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
you cloud access to octoprint so

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,119
octoprint by default is

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,119
uh is meant to be run on your local

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,960
isolated network you should not

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,560
expose it to the public internet even

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,640
though some people do it

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,640
why there are heaters on there you

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,560
should not expose something with heating

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,800
elements that are capable of starting a

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,000
fire to the public internet i do my best

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,640
to secure stuff

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
but i'm a human i can make mistakes so

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,680
please do not

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,960
expose octoprint to the public internet

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,200
user vpn or

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,599
use cloud service for that so this is

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,640
something that people use as well

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,920
and yeah a lot of people also using

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
plugins to

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,800
get really creative with regards to some

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,760
hardware that they interface so there

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,960
are

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,079
people who write for example

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,200
plugins that yeah

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,400
control lead stripes

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,760
with individually addressable um

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,079
with individually addressable uh led

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,000
pixels so to speak to to plot the

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,880
progress and to turn red when something

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,800
failed or to

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,960
turn green when it's completed and all

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,599
that or a beeper

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,520
or they fire up a keyboard or something

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,800
so there is a bunch of stuff that you

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,160
can do

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,880
yeah um this is a video of my uh

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,000
my manager actually building a 3d

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,040
printed pumpkin with the

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,839
octocat embedded yeah yeah and uh he's

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
got a um

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,079
a nice led light and an html plug hdmi

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,000
plug as well

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
um so if anybody's interested it is open

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,520
sourced

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,280
and i honestly have no idea of how what

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
sort of services he used but i know he's

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
very familiar with the octoprint as well

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,280
uh as far as i know he used octoprint

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,280
for that

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,880
he didn't use octolapse from the looks

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,240
of it though because it was like that

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,000
this looked more like the time lapse

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,560
that octoprint itself would produce

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,320
so not the magic one from octolapse but

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,160
yeah so there's a lot of amazing stuff

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,000
that people build

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,160
yeah yeah this is uh some good stuff and

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,839
like it's i'm tempted to

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,839
get a 3d printer to build some of the

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,280
stuff like that but i've got so many

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,640
software projects that i've been working

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
on that i have to finish yeah i know the

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
problem

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,800
i mean i got a printer back then as a

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,320
hobby and then it turned into my job so

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,240
yeah yeah that is that but you could

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,920
also get a laser cutter there is also a

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
laser cutter that runs octoprint behind

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
oh really

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
yeah nice really from a from a munich

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,839
startup and they

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,599
adjusted octoprints so that it would

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,680
drive their their laser cutter so

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,079
yeah oh that's interesting because um so

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,560
like there is a laser cutter that um

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,920
that actually my wife has which is the

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,200
cricut machine which most people might

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,040
be familiar with maybe

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,240
if you are on pinterest or anything like

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,640
that um

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,040
but that software is awful and they

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,160
charge you out like out the nose

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,680
for using it monthly which is a great

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,839
way for them to make money but it's very

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,720
annoying um because like

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,320
we're not laser cutting stuff like every

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,200
every week we're doing like once every

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,280
three months

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,560
so what i'm getting at is like i'm

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,160
actually intrigued now about the laser

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,760
cutter

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,599
yeah i mean you probably can just swap

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
the electronics if push comes to shelf

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,880
and

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,640
i mean a laser cutter is pretty much

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,680
people who do razer cutters will

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,359
probably now want to

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,200
want to hurt me for that but the laser

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,720
cutter and the 3d printer are in

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,079
principle they are both just cnc

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,119
machines they have

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,400
x and y they also have z maybe and in

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,920
the case of the laser you control the

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
intensity of the beam and in the case of

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
the com

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,920
of the 3d printer you control how much

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,079
material

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,119
is extruded at what temperature and

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,280
that's that so

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,280
they are very familiar you they you can

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,680
probably use g-code to control both of

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,160
them

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,520
and that also means that you can do some

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,800
fun stuff

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,800
uh with tools like octoprint not

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
not out of the box because yeah it needs

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,400
modification the modification

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,520
that they did is like specific to this

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,280
one but

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,640
uh yeah with open source there's a lot

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,680
of possibilities

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,520
as always yeah for sure and um

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,960
yeah it's it's very tempting it's like

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,200
having the superpower but

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
needed to keep it constrained because of

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,400
time constraints

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,760
i like seeing my family and apparently

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,280
my family likes coming in

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,960
when the the camera's live too as well

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,350
so they like seeing me as well

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,560
um obviously

00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,720
[Laughter]

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,560
excellent yeah i i know the problem i

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,800
mean you you might see that i have a i

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,240
have an oscilloscope there i have a

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,000
i have a power supply there i have

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,319
soldering iron but i

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,079
really use this all to also all too

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,440
rarely because of all the other stuff

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,880
that

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,440
i already do so yeah it's it's a problem

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,920
of too

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,680
too much awesome stuff to play with and

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,240
too little time as always

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,200
in our lives i guess yeah yeah excellent

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,680
and uh

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,960
speaking of which i asked folks who are

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
in the chat if they are using 3d

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,640
printers and it sounds like anakin just

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,520
got a 3d printer and is getting octokit

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
running

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,640
as we speak uh actually dr kit was

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,240
something else

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,240
yes advocated completely different

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,000
octoprint um

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
is what he's getting running um actually

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
just recently as well as

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,040
santoshi who's been in the chat

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,680
answering questions uh

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,599
also um loves the community and loves

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,040
the plugins as well

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,040
yeah i'm also really happy with the

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
community i gotta say like

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,599
all in all they are an utterly awesome

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,640
bunch and it also surprises me all the

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,640
time what

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,839
what yeah what what stuff they come up

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,240
with so we have i

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,680
i about two years ago or so i created a

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,599
community forum

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,920
uh because before that it was all spread

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,280
across various groups and discussion

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,079
boards and whatnot and i wanted one

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
central hub

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,280
where people could go and meet people

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
like them and

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,480
using the same stuff like them and all

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,079
that and we also have a showcase

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,720
category in there where people can just

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,480
show

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,319
not only what they built with octoprint

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,119
so if they build some awesome plug-ins

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,200
or some awesome

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,880
automations or something for example you

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,680
can also integrate octoprint right into

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,920
home assistant

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,640
so you have a connection to paulus there

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,280
as well um

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,119
but uh also what they printed with

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,720
octoprint for example and there are some

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,240
amazing things there

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,640
from from from uh keyboards to uh to

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,400
some

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,680
display units for home automation

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,800
systems and all that

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,160
all just with printed cases and with i

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,839
also remember something with

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,599
for beekeeping but i can't remember the

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,440
details right now so

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,280
yeah it's absolutely amazing what people

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,680
get get up to

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
uh in their spare time like yeah octo

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,359
screen is also successful there are a

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,040
bunch of people now who write

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,400
there's octoscreen there's octodash

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,920
there's also something else that i

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
forgot the name right now i'm

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,119
awfully sorry to the author um my head

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,640
is just too full with names all the time

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,319
and those are like when you want to put

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,319
a small screen right next to your

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,520
printer but with which you can control

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,000
octoprint directly

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,720
and yeah that's there's a ton of stuff

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
there

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,480
that use case of um like thick like

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,400
small part printing

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,079
to fix like one-off things like i

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,040
actually have a keycap on my keyboard

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,200
that's missing

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,160
i know i could probably buy a keycap and

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,480
replace it

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
but also folks who are printing keycaps

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,960
and

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200
to replace on their the keyboard if you

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,000
want to have like a nice cool

00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,640
design or something absolutely for your

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,480
brand

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,079
i know people have been commenting on my

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,000
pizza slice behind me

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,640
but i wouldn't mind printing some uh

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
some pizza slices on my for my keycaps

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,119
i mean i printed the the the

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,599
case for my num block here

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,119
which i also built myself oh no so not

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,280
entirely myself this was an

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,880
open source design and i had the pcbs

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,720
made and all that and then but

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,240
yeah in the end i just put it into the

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,520
printed enclosure because

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,560
i have a printer so why not

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,839
how how about the um the um what do you

00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,480
call the stuff that you put in the

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,800
printer

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,839
it's not you know filament yes that's

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,440
what i was trying to because it's not

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,440
resin it's uh filament

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,119
yeah it's filament so how about the the

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,160
cost around filament is that easy to

00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,839
come by

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,359
yeah absolutely so when i started out

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,880
this was still a nightmare because i had

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,160
to actually order it in the netherlands

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,720
because i could not get

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,000
get any my hands on it in in in germany

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,640
and all that but by now you can

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
just get this stuff off amazon uh or

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,960
ebay or such

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,040
and uh yeah the usual price point these

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,880
days is something like

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,720
uh i'm going to say euros now but you

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,000
could probably just translated 101 into

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,200
us dollars which is like

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,040
20 20 year 20 euros maybe four kilogram

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,200
of this stuff which lasts you a long

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,599
time like let me maybe quickly

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,839
i'll be right back uh

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,359
so this is a bit more expensive stuff

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,920
but um

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,560
this is like the size that you get when

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,359
you buy

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,000
a one kilogram spool and this really

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,040
holds

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,480
a while and this is like 175

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,839
uh 1.75 millimeter diameter these days

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,560
when i started it was all

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,960
still double the size basically um

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,160
and really really really trivially to

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,599
come by

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,200
there are also people who print with

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,880
trimmer line from the hardware store by

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,240
the way

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,400
oh what's that trimmer line that that is

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,640
the stuff that you use when you have a

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,480
how do you say when you when you have to

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,359
when a wheat whacker when you have a

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,240
weed

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,079
yes and they the stuff that you put on

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,040
there is actually just nylon filament

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,800
pretty much and

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,640
when um when all this stuff started like

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,760
10 years or more ago

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,880
people that there was no filament so it

00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,000
started with

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,200
with uh with uh with trimmer line

00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,839
then usual filament came and about i'm

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,760
maybe a month or so ago there was like

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,920
an uproar in the 3d printing community

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,359
someone tried to print with trimmer line

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,359
and it worked and it was like yeah i

00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,319
know this is how it started

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,599
wow yeah it's all coming back we are we

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,560
are already in the retro phase

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,200
apparently

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,240
yeah yeah that's that's amazing but yeah

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,440
uh do what you

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,359
got to do as well to to solve a problem

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,880
and if this trimmer line is what's

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,920
available for a couple bucks at the

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
hardware store

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,760
like so be it there we go hey you

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,880
probably can already buy filament at

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,280
most hardware stores

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,960
so because you also can buy printers at

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
a lot of hardware stores these days

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,200
and i just saw in this in in the chat

00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,880
that jacob asks uh prince only come

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,760
out to a few dollars for smaller prints

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,359
and yep that's it so prints are

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,200
really expensive what com what can

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,839
really add up is the number of prints

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,280
that you do

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,839
for example if you're prototyping a

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,400
design and it takes a long while to get

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,880
it right

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,319
then yeah but it's not like you're

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,359
losing hundreds of dollars or something

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,440
it's more like

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,880
suddenly it's not no longer just two

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
dollars but now it's

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,280
10. so yeah but that's the the beauty of

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,960
if there's already a solve problem or in

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,880
the showcases or the examples

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,800
um this sounds like there's a community

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,440
so if you are looking for key caps

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,200
or to build up your number block um it's

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
a solve problem so perhaps those are

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,000
open source then you could just leverage

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,280
those those um

00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,280
blueprints i guess do you call them

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,839
blueprints um for

00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,520
models okay or just stl because that's

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,599
the file extension

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,720
and people just say like do you have an

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,880
stl or something

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,160
github actually shows stls in the

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,160
repository browser

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,359
yes that is uh something that was

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,160
actually a tip on

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,960
our recent change log um which i don't

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,800
know if folks are

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,319
familiar if you're here and you have not

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,359
been following our

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,720
our actual youtube account and uh

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,640
i mentioned this wasn't going to be a

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,119
github um

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,240
uh showcase but let me see if i could

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,720
find a sto

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,520
if you if you switch to my screen i have

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
one okay

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,079
it just needs to load which i hope it

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,359
will do now

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,359
it isn't that big actually

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,079
hello it's only when you're looking at

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,400
it yeah apparently that maybe we should

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,960
look back and look away again

00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:02,240
yeah maybe let me let's see um example

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,480
there we go okay for you it loads

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,880
perfect

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,760
yeah right now mine mine is is not

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,680
liking it right now but okay

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,520
okay you can see stl files directly

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,720
inline we've made a lot of changes to um

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
how github interacts with different

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,040
files so

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,119
one thing that we didn't have up until

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,440
this year was being able to embed videos

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,400
uh i'm not sure when sdl's became a

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,400
thing but um

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,240
oh it's it's been some years actually i

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,960
think at least five or so because i

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,000
remember

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,640
because i remember it was i yeah it was

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,520
definitely

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,520
not yet long that i was working on

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,839
octoprint full time when this made the

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,240
rounds and was like oh that's awesome

00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,040
so yeah awesome yeah so this is uh

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,720
powered with the

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,200
i can download the stl file so if you

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,040
wanted to get an example to print

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,960
um you could actually print your 3d

00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,200
model of skyline

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,800
um which uh this is basically my

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,400
contribution graph so you can see

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,079
where i was getting ready for some demos

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,640
towards the end of the year

00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,359
oh yeah yeah it's like just a square

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,240
block

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,800
of this non-stop coding um but yeah this

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,119
is my

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,079
2020 contribution graft and uh we've

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,000
just made it into

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,720
something that you could print uh for

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,640
fun because why not

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,480
but i'll drop that in the chat for folks

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,920
oh perfect you've got yours

00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
on the reddit too as well my 2020 with

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,119
my

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,960
with my three week gap where i took a

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,800
vacation which was really needed

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,000
so i'm proud of of the gaps you are

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,000
proud of the blocks so

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,000
yes we are all proud of something in

00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,280
2018 i have a three month gap because

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that's when my youngest was

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,720
was born oh yeah absolutely

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,359
understandable

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,200
excellent um so we're rounding up

00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,200
towards the end i wanted to say uh save

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,240
some time to talk about github stars but

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,440
uh did you want to um yeah do you have

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,839
anything else you wanted to share before

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,700
we

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,920
round up the conversation um

00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,160
[Music]

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,960
only if you use octoprint and aren't yet

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,640
then maybe you

00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,079
want to become a member on the community

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,440
forums because there's a lot of tips

00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,960
there there's a lot of awesome stuff to

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,480
see there and we also have a discord

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,480
server that i would

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,599
like to point you to because same thing

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,880
as the forum just

00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,720
like instant yeah

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,240
which is uh i love that discord is

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
really sort of embracing the open source

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,440
community

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,640
uh i did approach the uh the obs discord

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,440
there's like 41 000 people in it

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,640
which was it was intense it's a very um

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,559
fast moving fast pace

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,480
it's like being on live on a very

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,280
popular streamer which i saw ninja this

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,559
went live

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,400
so if you want to see what a chat looks

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,319
like that you can't read uh that's

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,920
that's what that discord looked like

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:40,160
um excuse me has a question so feel free

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,280
to ask your question scarce moves um

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,280
if it's about octoprint

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,520
that that is a tricky question um

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,720
because the thing is it always depends

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,400
on what you want right

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,400
i mean if ultimaker is more like

00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,720
i would at this point i would more like

00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,640
call them a prosumer brand rather than a

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,079
consumer brand because this is

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,280
like the uh more like the the audience

00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,240
also that they have chosen for

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,280
themselves

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,520
no name is really hit and miss so

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,119
in general when you want to buy a

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,839
printer the first thing that i want

00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,000
would do

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,599
if i were you was i would first of all

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,520
figure out what i want to use it for

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,160
because what printer recommend

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,680
entirely basic yeah pretty much entirely

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,400
depends on what you actually want to use

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,079
it for

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,680
an fdm printer for example if you want

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,240
to print miniatures an ftm printer

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,160
wouldn't be

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,240
the entirely wrong choice because it the

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,160
resolution is just not fine enough for

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,280
something like your dungeon and dragon's

00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,800
miniatures or

00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,880
warhammer figurines or something like

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,040
that

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,720
so stuff like this is first of all most

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,880
important and then you need to figure

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,960
out what

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,800
options you have for that and then i

00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,000
would definitely recommend

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,599
to go on social to go on reddit to go on

00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,440
forums and seek out people who have this

00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:02,000
thing and what they have to say about it

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:05,119
because i hinted at it there's a lot of

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,079
bad stuff out there that does not work

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,640
is advertised

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,079
and especially the really cheap stuff is

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,680
something that you do not

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,079
want to necessarily uh get up with i

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,440
mean

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,280
there are printers that are really

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,520
really cheap but there are also so

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,319
inherently insecure that they regularly

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,240
burn people's homes down and this is not

00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,160
a joke sadly so

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,520
um there have been cases there have been

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,359
pictures that i have seen

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:33,520
and uh yeah so be careful

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,800
um as far as understood you can print

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,160
with two types of famous on the ultimate

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,680
exactly to solve rendering you're able

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,720
to do crazy prints yeah but this is not

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,200
ultimaker

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,760
specific so uh you're probably talking

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,200
about

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,520
what was it called again you no

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,359
i have forgotten what it was called but

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,480
pva it's actually pva like the stuff

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,319
that is in glue

00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,400
um you can also print pva with

00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,559
other printers you also have dual nozzle

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,480
printers or multi-extruder printers

00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,000
other than ultimaker out there so really

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,040
just figure out what you need what you

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,599
want and then

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,480
do your market research and don't just

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,160
go for

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,839
a specific brand also high jv peak

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,480
yeah you got some friends in the chat

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,119
apparently

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,240
uh excellent um yeah that's pretty

00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,079
insightful for folks who

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,599
weren't catching on we were just talking

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,079
about recommendations for 3d printers

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,680
and

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,359
uh really it sounds like if you just

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,040
jump into forms jump in the reddit

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,800
uh and start talk about what you're

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,480
looking to build um you can probably get

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,599
some recommendations that way

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,960
and uh yeah more like fans

00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,640
jv peak is a fan excellent

00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,079
so speaking of fan uh i wanted to

00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,359
actually take a look at your get up

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,559
stars it's something i've always

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,720
i've tried to round up a lot of the

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,559
conversations for open source friday

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,920
on stars because i find it's always

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,119
unique it's kind of like looking at

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,800
someone's like

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,720
i don't know you go in he's giving like

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,720
a tour of your house uh we looked at

00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,240
some of the code that you you put

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,359
together to actually make the plug-in

00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,200
architecture for

00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,559
for octoprint but it's also cool to see

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,040
what you're interested in

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,599
uh so you actually have a ton of stars

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,400
uh which

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,440
sometimes some folks don't use stars

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
which i i

00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,280
that's fine but star is a really cool

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,760
way for you to save projects for later

00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,680
so

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,200
give octoprint a star uh if you want to

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,040
check this out um

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,040
but anything you want to talk about and

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,160
why you why you started any interesting

00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,920
projects here

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,040
yeah the the top three are actually

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,119
related to all the stuff that i'm

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,920
currently doing in my spare time so

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,839
um local two year is like a project that

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,079
i found that partners well with home

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,240
assistant so i'm also

00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:36,480
very much into home automation uh most

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,000
of the stuff here is in some way all the

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,799
other way connected to my local

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,880
home assistant instance and i recently

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,680
ran into issues with my lights

00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,480
because those are you or otherwise

00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,680
zigbee

00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,559
based and i am living in a rented

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,119
apartment

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,119
surrounded by neighbors who do not care

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,680
about me trying to run a zigbee mesh

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,520
here

00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,520
and have their wifi channels all over

00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,000
the place so i'm currently looking into

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,880
replacing the lights with wi-fi bulbs

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,839
with have

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,160
come really low in price but most of

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,079
them

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,440
are not easily hackable these days

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,599
anymore sadly

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,200
so a lot of this a lot of these that you

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,200
can um

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,440
can buy they are they are on the

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,880
so-called two-year cloud or smart home

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,480
or something like that is also another

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,160
name for it and you

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,839
have to use that with a dedicated app

00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,119
and it phones home to some

00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,480
chinese server or something this is

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,520
something that i don't want i want my

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,000
whole full home

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,680
completely and utterly isolated from

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,160
anything in the cloud

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,760
um and as far as i understood this this

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,200
repository i still have to look into the

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,160
details but as far as i understood this

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,079
this will basically

00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,400
fake this cloud part so i just have to

00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,920
set it up once and then i can have this

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,160
take care of everything so this sounds

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,960
like a nice fallback if i cannot hack

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,480
the

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:53,200
the bulbs that i got uh otherwise

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,640
okay yeah excellent yeah i'm actually

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,520
gonna give that a star myself

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,799
because i i will be setting up my my

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,599
house with home assistant

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,400
um in the next couple weeks hopefully um

00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,520
i wanted to get the uh the blue box that

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,720
is yeah yeah yeah the yep so those are

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,920
sold out so i think i'm gonna go with

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,920
the raspberry pi route

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,040
uh so i just gotta order order one of

00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,280
those and get those set up

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,119
i think these mine actually runs just on

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,680
my synology nurse and

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,720
okay nice works fine yeah so there are

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,200
options

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,640
then next seo i'm currently working on a

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,000
relaunch of my personal

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,359
uh of my personal uh homepage and

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,640
i i since i'm also re evaluating react

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:36,480
as a future ui framework for octoprint

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,240
i'm i figured i might as well use

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,599
something that

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:45,040
makes me or allows me to practice react

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,000
so i went with next gis and just the

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,680
other day i was

00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,280
trying to figure out how to do all this

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,960
open graph stuff so that

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,680
if you want to share a blog post of mine

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,280
for example you also actually get this

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,040
nice little image card and all that on

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,839
twitter and facebook

00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,760
this is where that came in and i've

00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:03,200
deployed it on my local

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,280
development stuff so currently nothing

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,680
is online yet but uh yeah i'm getting

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,040
there

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,599
it's something that uh yeah whenever i

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,720
find

00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,160
some some relaxed minutes these days i

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,880
just grabbed the laptop

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,440
and work on it but yeah it's been taking

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,400
whole

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,319
all of march so far yeah what i found is

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,040
uh i waited for one division until they

00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,280
got like

00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,720
like six episodes and that was sort of

00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,720
my my

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,799
chill time trying to figure out what the

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
show was about but also write some code

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,640
so that's that's been my life hack is

00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,559
like put on a show that i can watch

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,760
sort of half watch and half think with

00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,680
code and

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,280
i was able to uh solve some problems

00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,319
that way also

00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,760
time i i i do that when my partner plays

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,599
video games because

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,040
yeah i enjoy watching those but

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,319
sometimes there are down times and all

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,520
that and then i can just

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:57,119
yeah this is perfect absolutely perfect

00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,559
yeah and mega desk is so i i sit a lot

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,240
i sit way too lot uh so back in early

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,680
2016 i got myself

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,960
an ikea standing desk an electrical one

00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,359
yeah so actually i can just now like

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,640
press here and you see that something

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:16,000
here changes

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:18,480
right go go away bye-bye

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,079
uh and uh the problem with the kia

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,400
standing that's the behind test that i

00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,680
got

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,359
is that it has a control unit but you it

00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,720
does not have something like presets

00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,720
where you can say

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,240
drive up to standing height drive down

00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,200
to to sitting height and this was

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,000
annoying

00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,400
so last year i stumbled over this one

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,040
thanks to the changelog.com podcast

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,680
or rather the newsletter from them and

00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,160
ordered that

00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,880
on tindy and had it lying around here

00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,040
for months now and last week i finally

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,799
sat down dug out the repository again

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,200
dug out the documentation

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,720
and replace the controller unit on my

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,240
desk and now it's absolutely awesome

00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,319
because i have these presets

00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,400
and i also got myself a an a serial con

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:02,480
a serial converter so that i can flash

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,720
it with new firmware because i

00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,520
hope to maybe be able to modify it a bit

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,760
more

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,359
awesome yeah i i remember this repo

00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,400
because someone actually tweeted it

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,920
um because they sort of they they made

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,960
their standing desks work

00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,760
based on their github commits which was

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,880
like real it was

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,599
like a really silly trivial um task to

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,359
do but

00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
basically they were to make their their

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,079
desk go up and down based on like what

00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,559
they were working on

00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,359
um which was clever but also kind of

00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,640
silly

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,400
yeah this is but this is actually

00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,960
something that i want to achieve because

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,640
i saw that this is also the point where

00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,000
i definitely did start this i saw that

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,920
they are currently working on getting

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,319
serious support in this thing so that i

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,640
can

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:45,040
also attach something like an esp32 to

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,760
it and then wire it up to home assistant

00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,520
so i could do stuff like i don't know

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,319
that thing detects i've had

00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,440
i've sit i've set i've set too long or

00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:57,119
something and then it

00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,960
just drives it up yeah or something

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,640
yeah it's really nice it would be nice

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,160
to connect that to your apple watch when

01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,599
it tells you to uh

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,000
stand up every hour or whatever it is

01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,599
absolutely yeah excellent and also i

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,720
mean my desk also has a twitter account

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,640
from back when i was experimenting with

01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,920
with distance measurements and all that

01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,440
through esp8266 modules and

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,680
back then i had it so that it just

01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,240
measured the distance to ground with an

01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,480
ultra

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,480
uh sorry an uh ultrasound right

01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,319
ultrasound is english word with an

01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,640
ultrasound sensor and

01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,599
then whenever i switched to standing it

01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,359
would tweet out

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,720
gina is now standing and whenever it

01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,040
switched to sitting it would

01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,720
treat out gina is now sitting so that

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,839
was also something that i could react to

01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,240
the hits then

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,119
yeah and i like jv peak's uh example

01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,359
where you can

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,240
control twitch chat to uh control your

01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,520
desk so

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,680
oh yes no no no no no no so as an opt-in

01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,680
it's like gina's she's concentrating too

01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,920
much let's raise her desk up

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,319
which would be hilarious but also very

01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,319
annoying

01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,400
yeah work done but yeah thanks for uh

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,480
thanks for uh i guess

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,599
obliging and going through that uh that

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,799
little exercise with me

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,160
it's always nice to see what people are

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,680
working on and seeing what they're

01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,799
starring because usually the stars

01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,200
correlate with like

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,400
interest and we won't even look at my

01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,200
stars because my stars

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,839
well now i include your stars but uh i

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,440
also have

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,280
tons of side projects tons of stuff that

01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,160
i'm just like starring for later

01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,079
and we'll yeah yeah i also recently came

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,520
across across this bookmark manager

01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,920
called raindrop io and

01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,760
started structuring all the bookmarks

01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,359
that i come across all the time and

01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,359
it's ridiculous what this collection has

01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,799
grown to in just a bit over

01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:43,839
two weeks so yeah wow i have

01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,200
yeah way too much stuff yeah i i always

01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,119
do like a clean up usually around the

01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,640
holidays uh i'll do a clean up of all

01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,640
the stuff that i didn't get to

01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,000
and like stuff that actually really i do

01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,799
want to get to those will get

01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,319
rise to the top of the list but um

01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:59,440
unfortunately i still haven't

01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:59,920
touched that list so it's uh too much

01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,640
stuff

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,960
but uh speaking of what um gina thanks

you have not tried octoprint if you're

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,960

to accomplish through the examples

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,280
uh i think this is uh an awesome

01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,839
community that you can sort of

well

01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,000
early after the other company decided

01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,319
that they didn't have any more money

01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,559
