on the open source friday here at github

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,599
so would you like to tell us a little

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,239
bit about your project first now

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,360
obviously

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,200
you are one of the maintainers of you

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
stripe checkout so would you like to

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
tell us a little bit

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
about what viewstripe checkout is

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
alright

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,400
so view stripe checkout is actually a

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,560
ujs plugin for stripe checkout

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
i've been maintaining it for about three

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
to four years

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
now i guess and uh uh

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,000
started out just uh you know uh personal

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
liking

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
or just for my personal use but then i

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,200
started to notice that

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
people are using it and uh started to

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,680
get uh

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:54,160
to gain attention and the

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,280
people are also posting issues and the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,400
issue feature requests all that stuff

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
and yeah so

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,680
i i actually decided to get serious

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,680
about it

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,720
and yeah amazing we hear from a lot of

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
our

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
open source maintainers that a lot of

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,239
them start maintaining projects because

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,560
they started

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
wanting to use it first or they you know

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,879
they've built something for their own

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
personal use

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,360
to start off with and so um would you

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
like to tell us a little bit about

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
how you actually got started with view

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
stripe checkout and

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
what you wanted to use it for in the

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
first place

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,360
right so i was working for a startup

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,959
company

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,000
and they actually wanted

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,120
a feature that

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,239
that will have a subscription uh

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,200
method and uh we search for

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
some products and then we stumbled upon

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,799
stripe

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,720
so strep is actually really good because

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,280
the documentation is really clear and

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
it's very easy to integrate and uh so we

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,040
decided to use it and then

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
so yeah i i decided to create a plugin

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
so

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
because you know we're using it on

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
different uh

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,439
a website so i want i wanted the the

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,199
code to be reusable

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,960
and so i decided to create this flag in

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,680
the publish account so

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
that's pretty much it and we see stripe

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
used a lot across a lot of different

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,040
platforms and some people in chat saying

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
stripe is headquartered in san francisco

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
and yes i believe

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,840
you are correct and we do have a amazing

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
stripe

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,720
team here in the apac region which is

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,000
fantastic and a lot of websites

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,360
are using it so can you give us a

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
rough idea of how many different

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
projects platforms are now using

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
viewstripe checkout and what it

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,000
what specifically are they using it for

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,479
and how does it make it

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
a really good added bonus to what stripe

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,960
already provides

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,919
oh well i'm not really quite sure about

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
the number but

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,280
according to my to the information in my

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,639
repository it's used by at least 400

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,240
uh open source projects on github

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
and uh actually it's very convenient to

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
use because uh

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,000
i have this feature that i it will load

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
the actual sdk when you actually just

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
needed it

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,800
so you don't have to load it uh all the

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
time

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
you know yeah so i guess that's that's

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,080
uh

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,160
what's uh special about it

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,600
and and you've got like i'm i'm just

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,520
checking out the website now all

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,199
technically your github repository to

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
checking this out now so if anyone wants

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
to go

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
check out the github repo i'll pop the

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,120
link in the chat as well

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
um as you mentioned yeah used by over

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,160
440 people which is amazing

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,759
and you got 20 contributors at the

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
moment so

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,440
um if i was wanting to come and to

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,560
contribute

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
to your project for the first time what

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
kind of top tips would you

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,400
give me first and then we'll talk

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
through like an example but what's the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
kind of top tips you would give me

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
as a first time contributor coming to

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
view stripe checkout

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,800
right so first you of course you can

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,720
just start with an issue

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,680
but i would suggest that you you should

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,360
put as much information as you could so

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
that you know

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
i will have an idea of what what the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,000
issue is about

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,840
so like is it a bug report or is it a

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,919
feature request

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,160
if it's a bug report it's better if you

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,800
have a screenshot of the error

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
and a detailed uh description of the

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,560
problem

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,440
so so that it will make it easier for me

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
to

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,560
you know to debug or to solve the

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,599
problem

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,440
uh if it's a feature request uh

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,720
because sometimes uh this plugin gets

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,960
uh gets behind to the actual

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
stripe sdk so sometimes they have a new

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
feature and

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
it's not yet implemented in here so uh

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,599
just provide the

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,800
you know the link to that a new feature

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,199
so that i can

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
easily look it up and uh you know have a

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
plan on how to

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,000
implement it uh that kind of stuff

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah that's i think that's it nice and

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
if i

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960

october 1st so how has your

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
community kind of responded to

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,470
oktoberfest and how have you found

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,479
oktoberfest this year so far there's no

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,319
[Music]

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
oktoberfest related uh pull requests

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
here okay so just

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,759
just the one issue no no pull requests

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,960
for octopus

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,400
um but if you were talking to some

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,360
first-time contributors not necessarily

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,000
to

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
maybe your project but to anyone what

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,560
are kind of the

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,039
top tips you would give to contributors

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
or

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,960
finding a project or coming to a project

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,840
for the first time like you've mentioned

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,680
like coming and giving really really

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,160
good information on what your issue

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,919
is or your feature request but what are

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
the what other kind of tips would you

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,479
give to first time

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,519
or people coming to open source right

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,399
so first of all the most important thing

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,719
is to

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
read the documentation first so just to

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
make sure that

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
you're not posting something that is

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
actually

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,240
already written in the documentation and

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
uh

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,040
you have to be nice to the

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,640
to the maintainers of course and uh uh

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,480
yeah yeah i think that was the most

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,200
important thing is just to give

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,160
as much information as you can because

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,080
it helps uh us the maintainers and

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,560
you know to determine what's what's up

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,320
and let's talk about documentation let's

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,839
have a quick look at your documentation

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
because i like seeing really nice

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
documentation

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,920
if we have a look at your readme file

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,800
it's very nicely laid out

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,120
it feels like all the information is

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
that you need like as a first time

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
person coming to a repository like yours

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,959
i can see exactly

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
what it does and what it is and then if

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,680
we have a look at

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,040
um your contribution guidelines because

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,080
i say you've got those as well this will

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
give me

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
um a lot also your code of conduct and

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
your

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,120
um your guidelines this gives me a lot

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
of information about

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,320
what to do how everything works and i

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
think this is

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,480
this is like a really good example of a

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,800
nicely set out

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
project um this is your contribution

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,839
like lines i was looking for

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,839
oh

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,000
but you mentioned a couple of things

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,880
about being really nice

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,320
to the maintainers and you've been

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
maintaining

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,680
views check out for how many years now a

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,680
couple years uh

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
three to four years yeah three to four

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,839
years so you would have a lot of

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
experience as a maintainer right

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,680
so what everybody some of your like tip

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,720
top tips for

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,480
people who are maintaining projects

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,560
uh just be clear what about

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
uh sorry just be clear of what things

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,920
you wanted to

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,480
for like the insurers to do

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,519
so it's really good to have a issue

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,120
template

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,399
so you know uh for for first time

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
you should know what what to actually

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,079
put

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
what you're expecting them to input

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,160
there

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,920
and just just

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,279
just create a good documentation because

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,760
you know it uses the time

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:17,040
for users to actually ask any

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,880
you know all that stuff yeah

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
and you've got a community of about 440

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,800
people

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
using viewstrap checkout now so how have

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,360
you

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,560
built up this community

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,399
actually i didn't actually

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,120
do something special i just just just

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
i'm just waiting for issues or updates

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,640
and then i implement them and then

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,000
people are just coming because well

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,519
actually being is getting popular

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,959
as uh years go by so especially in

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,399
countries uh that they support so

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,800
and actually also view so it also goes

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
for

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,200
the popularity of view so the more

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,240
people

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,279
started to use view and

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,480
stripe they surely come to

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,040
my project and

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
if we talk about you know you talked a

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
little bit about like you know you got

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
involved in

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
doing this project because it's

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
something that you wanted to do yourself

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,839
and then you open it up to others

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
we talk about your journey as a

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,680
developer

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,600
how did you start developing

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
code getting involved as a developer and

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
how did you get involved in open source

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,639
to begin with right so i

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,680
i have a background in computer science

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,320
and uh and i started out as an android

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
developer

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,399
in my early years so and then i

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,519
converted to being

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,600
a web developer because that's what my

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,959
company requires at that time we're just

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,639
a small team so you know

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,959
you you should tend to

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
uh to have that skill to switch on

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,760
different uh

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,360
technologies and uh so

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,360
the first time i got into open source

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,399
was uh it was

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,519
when i created a plugin for angular 1.

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,240
so it was way back then when angular 1

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,279
was the

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,120
you know the best platform in the

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,240
in the world yeah so

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
i think what made me uh decide to stick

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
to open source is that

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,680
uh that time when i realized that

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,639
my project is actually helping others

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,000
and also

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,720
it's not just me but uh actual people

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,880
from

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,480
uh from different places are actually

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,519
using them so

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
yeah i think that's it so you kind of

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,360
went for that i think you

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,800
you kind of touched on the popularity of

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,079
view as well

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,639
um as a as a platform as a plug-in

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,920
um as a framework and we're seeing it

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,800
more and more become

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,720
popular so is there a specific reason

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,240
why you chose to write

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,279
this open source project in vue

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,720
well because mainly because we are

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:16,160
using djs as our main web platform

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,480
there was a time that we had

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,760
to choose between angular ah sorry

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
between red up and

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,760
uh view js but we did we decided to

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,560
use view and work so yeah most of my

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,000
open source projects are

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,959
built on top of pjs nice

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
and it seems like something that is um

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,360
as you did mention growing popular we

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,519
had

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
um someone on a couple of weeks ago who

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,000
built hopscotch and he did the whole

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,240
thing in

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,040
vue.js simply because he wanted to learn

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
view

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,560
um in the first place so how did you

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,399
come to view

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,399
as a as a framework

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,160
how did you start learning view and want

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,279
to learn view

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
well it's not it's not actually a matter

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,600
of one

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,519
it's a matter of need because uh

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,320
the company requires it uh for us to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
to use it so we actually switched from

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,120
uh

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,519
as i mentioned we were using angular 1

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,279
and then angular 2 came out but uh we're

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,480
not actually quite satisfied with

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,760
how they made the changes so we look for

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,880
some alternative

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,880
in the react and uh

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,519
djs was one of the choices so

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,199
yeah we did some research on what would

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,759
fit us the most

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,040
what would benefit us the most and uh we

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,600
went to

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,920
use uh so we chose it yeah

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,759
and i i like the fact that you said you

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,440
you came to it because like you didn't

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
necessarily want to it was just it was a

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
need you had to do it

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,079
i think that's really we need to learn

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
this see

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,320
someone go and learn it um so what are

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,800
your some of your tips to people

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,360
um who are in that kind of situation

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
that

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
well you've got one framework that

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,360
you're using

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,639
and it's you need to find an alternative

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,880
how do you

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,240
i go about finding that alternative and

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
how do you then like

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
dive in and start doing what are your

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,279
tips for people who are

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,360
in that kind of situation right so

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,480
basically first step should uh you

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,360
should determine your

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
problems and uh what you actually need

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,320
so

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
so that you can you know you will know

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,680
what to search

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,839
and uh the next step is to look for

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,920
options so you have to do a lot of

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,680
research to to see what's uh

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,519
or what are the good options that you

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,560
can choose from

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,160
and uh yeah so just basically

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:54,720
uh as for us we were

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,040
the the the main

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,519
uh attribute that we are looking for a

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,639
framework was

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
it should be easy to learn

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
and uh

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,760
yeah and i've noticed that um i think

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,319
one of the popularities about view right

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,480
is its

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,240
ease of use so i did a view

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
i needed to learn how to write a bit of

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,240
view i was like i needed to learn it

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
one of our websites was written in view

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
and i was like oh i do need to

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,480
learn about this and um i found

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
view mastery and i was able to build

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,480
from scratch

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,240
a website in three hours i didn't have

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
any viewer experience whatsoever so i

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
think that was one of the

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,160
things i really like about vue and we've

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,120
got a um a question coming from the chat

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,600
actually

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
about viewstruck checkout um and that's

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,160
um

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,400
do you actually need to sign up with

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
stripe first to be able to use your

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
plugin

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,640
yeah yeah uh it's actually required

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,400
because you need the

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,280
disappointable key from their dashboard

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,240
and it's required to

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,240
the plugin to work

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
do you want to talk us a little bit

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
about how it actually works in the back

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
end

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,200
because obviously stripe as you

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,760
mentioned has a really good um

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,120
api and plug-in and you've built this um

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
on top of it so you want to talk a

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,400
little bit about how it works from the

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,799
back end point of view

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,799
right so there's actually multiple

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,520
approaches that you can take when you

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,679
want to to use uh strive checkout

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,240
there's this uh they call this uh

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,520
client only integration so that's uh the

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,160
part where you don't

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,640
need any back-end experience or any

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
back-end

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,440
just just create the products and uh

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,760
in your strike dashboard and just uh

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,760
you know just get those ids and uh lay

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,000
them out in your front end and then

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,440
you know manual checkout and there's

00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,559
also this uh

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,600
an option this is this this is

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,799
what they recommend actually uh

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,280
using sessions so in the back end

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,080
uh whatever you're using in node.js or

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
or

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
php or what uh you should create a

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,799
session

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,919
and then that session will have a

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
session id

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,280
and then the session id will be used uh

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,440
as

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,400
uh as the main property

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,200
in the client side so that will detect

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,760
that

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,640
that id will determine what uh products

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,160
you

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
actually created in the background

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,480
and have you had a lot to do with i mean

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,880
obviously stripe is quite

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,200
a large big and popular platform

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,840
so have you had much to do with any

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,880
other maintainers who are building other

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,880
stripe plugins

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:03,039
yeah i actually there's also this

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,320
uh project called view stripe element so

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,520
but i i think it's inactive now so i

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
also

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,559
managed to create sample requests in

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
that

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:18,080
project but they never get uh rich

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
yeah i found it this one is this it want

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,720
another one

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,200
npm yep view stripe elements plus yes

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,760
it says published a year ago it looks

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,520
like

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,600
people are still downloading it whether

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,799
it's actually being maintained or not is

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
another question

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,080
so um do you want to talk to us a little

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
bit about

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,240
how well viewstripe checkout

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,159
works with other plugins and how many

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
other plugins can you have with stripe

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,960
and like how to how does that kind of

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,480
side of it work

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
right uh so new search checkout is

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
actually centered from the checkout

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
feature but uh

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,880
i also created a basic implementation

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,320
for

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,240
uh distributed element uh but um

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
i'm planning to create a separate

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,280
project for the furthermore

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,480
advanced uh implementation because they

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,159
actually updated that and i have to

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,159
catch up with the updates

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,520
i remember we've got some questions in

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,679
the chat about various strat

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,360
payment methods so there's the link for

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,120
all the all the stripe

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,400
payment methods i think there's there's

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
a bunch of them but yeah

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,720
there are a lot of people using um

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,480
stripe for various different

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
um platforms and obviously they've got

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,440
if you scroll down to the

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,200
the middle of their table there they've

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,280
got a whole bunch of different

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,880
payment methods depending on where you

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,840
live obviously wherein when

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,400
apac um so you know it takes a lot of

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
those

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,480
um main kind of platforms there for apac

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,280
so yeah um now what are some of your

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,200
plans for view struct checkout moving

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,760
forward are you going to

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
continue to maintain obviously you've um

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,919
you've got version three now

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,840
view stripe checkout um so what's kind

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
of your like your next stage or your

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
next goal or plan for view strike

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
checkout

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
great

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,760
i'm actually in the middle of a major

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
upgrade right now

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,360
so like there's a new documentation

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
coming and uh

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,799
i'm also like i mentioned i i am

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,600
planning to

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,640
create a separate project for new stripe

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,400
element alone

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,950
so and uh i also created a new

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
organization and i will move

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,440
[Music]

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,640
this repositories in that order and uh

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,919
yeah so this type checkout will be soon

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,039
a rename to just check

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:49,520
new strike slash checkout and

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,520
uh there'd also be a separate uh

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,240
project or repository for the elements

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,600
and uh yeah moving forward i i

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,120
am always planning to maintain it

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,520
as soon as i can and are you looking

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,559
for more contributors to come on board

is that something you're always like

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
kind of on the lookout for

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,919
or how do you like to run view strike

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,320
checkout from that

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,200

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,400
new documentation

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,600
so it will be transferred to

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,159
right now i'm i'm looking at sleep very

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,240
familiar with the state of jail

but i'm getting there yeah so yeah the

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
the documentation

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,559
sounds good and when you're like going

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,000
there and you're building your project

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
and you're building your shop checkout

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
and you're maintaining it where do you

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,200
kind of draw a lot of your inspiration

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,360
from do you like are you following other

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,159
projects regularly do you contribute to

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,279
other projects regularly

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,159
yeah yeah i'm actually a regular uh

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
return to officers so if there's

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,279
something

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,480
there's like there's a new repository or

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,559
there's a new project

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,200
that i find interesting i sometimes

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,840
go through it and look for what to

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
improve

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,960
all that uh

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,840
what are some of the ones you've done

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,559
just say in the last month

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:14,159
uh the last month i there's this uh

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,080
project for qr code so uh

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,520
and the and the the maintainer itself

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,880
usb

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
view uh vue.js developer and but he has

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,320
this

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,120
example for pjs so i just uh

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,720
improved the code so to make it like a

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,880
view more

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,720
but to make it more view like you know

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,440
the structures and all the yeah

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,799
and it sounds like view is definitely

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,799
one of your main languages

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,559
you mentioned angular as well what other

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,559
programming languages do you like to

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,080
write in

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,840
mainly i'm i'm coding javascript but

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,320
these past few weeks i've been learning

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,720
platforms

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,679
have to create this a mobile app for the

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
content so

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,360
i'm learning that that was flutter right

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,919
yeah that's one of the

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,679
i think flutter is now on the top five

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,880
of open source products that's a really

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,240
good one to know

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
um especially if you're into

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
contributing so what i love about a lot

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,080
about

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,960
um the maintainers we've had on um the

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
show

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,720
is that they're like you they like to

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
don't just maintain their own product

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
they're contributing back to open source

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
as well so

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
i want to really encourage everyone in

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,679
the chat and who's going to be listening

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,840
to this recording afterwards

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,960
uh to get out and to contribute to open

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
source because

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
you know there's really cool people like

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,679
jeff who are involved in them

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
and also you know as jeff mentioned he's

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
really really keen for him to come and

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,720
contribute

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,159
and it's only three two more days left

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,480
of hacktoberfest

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,919
um and i see that your project is tagged

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,400
with hacktoberfest

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,320
um so feel free to go and um jump on and

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,840
make any contributions

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,559
um to view stripe checkout for october

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,880
1st

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,640
uh are there any specific contributions

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
that you're looking for

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,840
here jeff like something that would

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,360
easily get your approval on a pull

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,720
request

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,600
right so maybe just uh this current

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
documented

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,840
documentation i have this is actually

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
updated because there's a recent update

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,200
from

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,080
strike so while waiting for the for the

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
new documentation

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,840
it would be worth if someone can can

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,480
implement that new

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,399
update in this current documentation i

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,360
think that's that's fine

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,880
yeah there we go go go and um jump on

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,399
board with that and go and update some

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,320
documentation it'd be

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,880
nice easy one for especially those

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,679
first-time contributors to come to

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,200
um i'm just thinking what else am i

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,559
looking at here on the screen i'm going

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,919
to check out all the really really cool

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,360
viewstripe checkout ones

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,039
i've got an interesting question from

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,279
the chat i'll ask it

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,039
feel free to say that that's not

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,840
relevant we don't have to talk about

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
that

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,480
um but we've got a question in chat

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,600
about 5g which is really random

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,080
but do you think 5g will make native

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,399
mobile

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,279
languages less necessary because

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,399
obviously we know

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,799
view um is written

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,039
like a lot of it's written for very nice

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,559
mobile interactivity as well so

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,399
is that something you'd like to comment

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,600
on feel free to say completely no as

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,039
well

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,760
very great now it's fine uh actually i'm

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,919
a fan of

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,760
progressive weapon web app and uh i

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,840
think uh this uh

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,039
new technology the biology will really

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,399
help people to appreciate

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,799
uh mobile web more so but i don't think

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,320
it will make the native mobile absolute

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,440
because you know there's

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,399
still these uh features that uh

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
the web app can do that there's that

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,159
that is available in media

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,399
uh platform and it sounds like you

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,200
you do a lot with mobile web app and it

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,480
sounds like you're

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
you know you quite kind of like the

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,600
mobile web app development so what are

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,200
some of your

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,720
tips for people who are developing on

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,679
mobile because if you look at a lot of

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
websites

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,200
you notice that a lot of them are not

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
designed

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,679
very well at all um for mobile use and a

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,799
lot of them haven't

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,200
thought about their usage of their app

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,559
on web and mobile they've only designed

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,360
something for the web and haven't

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,760
thought about

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,360
the mobile experience so what are some

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,240
of your tips for people who are

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,200
developing

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,600
um either a web app that would be going

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,960
to moba or developing a specifically

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,600
mobile

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,600
app all right so first of all

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,600
the most important thing is to

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
look for something that's already ready

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,000
made

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,679
so like a bootstrap you know you don't

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,559
really have to reinvent the

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
wheel you know so because uh a lot of

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,399
people are

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,559
actually uh uh

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,760
contributing their uh valuable time to

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,039
create these things for

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,799
after for us to use uh uh these amazing

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,600
technologies like uh yeah

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,559
like i mentioned bootstrap so it's it's

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,159
uh

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,679
it's really amazing because uh it's

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,799
it's it's mobile ready

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,919
already you know so

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,960
uh unless you really have to you can

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,520
you can rate your own but uh

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,080
uh it would be really unnecessary just

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
uh

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,360
just use some already existing

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,640
technologies like bootstrap

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,200
and in my case uh i mainly use

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,559
beautify so that's that's uh that's the

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,960
most popular

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,320
uh ts framework for djs it's it's also

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,440
material design and uh

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,000
yeah i think that's it you you can

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,120
utilize what's uh what's already feet

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,200
and i think that's one of

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,200
my favorite things about coding and

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,720
especially about open source is most of

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
the time you don't need to reinvent the

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,880
wheel

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
there's stuff that's already there

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,960
that's already built and you can build

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,720
on top of that you know like 70

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
of the world's software is built on open

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,679
source anyway

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,919
um it's just that little bit actually

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,640
you're building on top right and so

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,360
when people are coming to build

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,000
something

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
um depending on what it is what's some

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,480
of your tips for

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,000
finding that baseline to find that thing

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
that they don't have to reinvent the

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
wheel i mean often we get a lot of

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
questions like

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,640
hey that's great that we don't have to

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,559
reinvent the wheel but where do we find

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,840
the wheel in the first place i see

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,840
so yeah in this

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
kind of stuff i think it's really easy

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,760
to draw the line

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,399
uh at least for me because uh uh

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,000
often times the specifications for what

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,360
you have to create is already

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,559
being laid out for you by your

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,120
say your senior engineers the architects

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,120
and also

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
you can always do some research if uh

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
this

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,039
thing is already existing so and i think

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,240
uh most of the time

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:12,559
uh if it's not uh really something

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,760
new i'm i'm sure that there's there's uh

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,799
there's a already existing

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,240
library for it so

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,840
yeah that's really cool and

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,440
again that's what i love about open

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,960
source is being able to find all these

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,880
things and go for it and that's one

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,039
thing i like about hackathons as well

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,080
is again don't have to reinvent the

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,760
world you can build something really

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,880
cool in three days by building on top of

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,240
other people's

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
um stuff basically now i want to have a

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,159
quick

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,600
look at um the open source guide um it's

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,279
just popped up on your reef and i was

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,279
like oh we should talk about that

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
um and there's that that's the this

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,200
guide about all these top

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,760
tips for contributing open source

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,480
finding projects starting projects

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,960
um best practices and things like that

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,640
um

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
talking about again a little bit about

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,200
finding projects so

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,000
how have you made it easy for people to

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,360
find

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,360
viewstripe checkout

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,519
other tips would you give maintainers

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,519
for making their projects easy to find

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,399
well just

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,240
create a repository in github because i

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,600
think it has a

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,039
really actually good way of handling seo

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,559
for searches and i'm sure that when your

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,159
project matures and

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,799
people will eventually find it

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,799
especially when

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,080
some are already using

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,559
yeah i think you're right like um you

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,559
know being able to have

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,240
that platform right we often get asked

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,840
here what is one of the biggest

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,760
advantages of github and it's like

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,320
there's over 50 million developers on

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,679
the platform and over like 120 million

00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,279
repositories like

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
there is so much stuff on there and

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,880
we've built up this big community and

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,279
i'm i'm super happy to hear that that's

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,519
one of your top tips is put it on github

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,359
guess what the community is that's what

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,200
that's something i i find you know

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,520
really really amazing and so

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,399
uh one other question i did have for you

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,720
is um

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,399
obviously this isn't a like a plug-in

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,240
for stripe

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,079
and you mentioned that stripe has you

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,200
know a lot of great documentation and

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,679
things like that

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,480
do you get do you have much to do with

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,800
the stripe

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,320
team itself and how like has the team

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,399
been helpful in

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,000
um you know helping you get this plug-in

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,159
off the ground

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,040
yeah actually recently uh i'm quite

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,440
surprised that

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,800
they contacted me that they told me that

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,599
they want to

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
start backing up the project financially

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,280
so

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,159
that's when i started to you know get

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,919
things together

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,919
again because uh i realized that uh

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,280
people are actually relying on this

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,960
project and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,280
i felt that a sense of responsibility to

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,320
you know to to maintain it more

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,000
seriously

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,599
and uh actually uh

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,920
the guys from stripe are actually very

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,599
helpful to me because uh

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
there's some things uh we actually had a

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,280
call

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
recently and they gave me some tips on

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,240
what

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,839
i can you know prioritize in the

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
documentation because they're planning

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,280
these

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,359
changes and the thing yeah

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
amazing it's really good that i love

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,720
when companies do that where they they

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,240
prioritize people who are building

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
really cool stuff for them so that's

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,240
great to hear that they're super

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,599
responsive now i just want to touch on

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,000
something that you kind of mentioned a

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,440
little

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,680
a little while ago and you brought it up

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,400
just now is that um

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,079
you know people are using this it's such

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,079
a great plug-in

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,119
you want to maintain it as long as

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,800
possible

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,839
how have you kind of future-proofed this

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
like this um repository like have you

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,720
like have you done things like have you

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,640
added a co-owner

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,839
um have you thought about what happens

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,599
if you can't maintain

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,880
are there have you built it up so that

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,800
other people could

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,599
take over for you right so

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,079
part of the of the major changes or the

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,640
major

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,119
major update that i'm planning is to you

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
know

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,240
transfer this to a public organization

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,040
and i'm planning to give

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,480
stripe uh and admin access to the

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,000
repository

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,119
so just in case that uh something

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,760
happens you know i think that that's the

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,960
that's the best approach that can i can

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,400
do

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,240
and you and you kind of mentioned it

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
before as well like you've already got

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,440
other maintainers or other contributors

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
involved as well

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,720
so you know i'm assuming like a lot of

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,560
those are going to continue to

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
contribute but something we like to talk

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,920
about

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,680
a little bit at github is the um the bus

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,320
factor which means if you got hit by a

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,480
bus

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,680
what would happen to your project and if

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,240
the answer is

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,000
it dies then it's kind of like oh okay

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,320
so it sounds like you've got a really

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,760
good like road map for um

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,359
you know review stripe checkout i'm

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,359
really excited to hear

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,400
that it's going into a public

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,680
organization

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,119
as well and you're giving straight

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,880
access i think um that'll probably allow

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,240
more people to get involved which is

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,720
really exciting

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,400
um and have you have you got a name for

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,920
that public organization or is it

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,040
already set up like where will we be

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,800
able to find

00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
view stripe checkout after you've made

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,960
these changes

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,839
right so i created the i called it view

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,359
straight so

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,960
you can actually find it right now

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,960
because it's already available

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,119
here we go oh there we go

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,240
awesome it's already there yeah i just

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,400
started to

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,560
uh transfer this uh uh demo

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,680
this is really exciting this is where

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,119
all of you strut

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,720
checkout is going to live correct great

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,240
and are you planning you kind of

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,960
mentioned just a little bit but are you

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,720
planning on

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,119
building other um stripe plugins with

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,200
ujs that are not just the checkout

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,839
plugin

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,839
yeah yeah yeah

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,000
because right now the uh the elements

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,680
part is actually included in the same

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,440
package but

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,960
for me it doesn't make sense because the

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,599
the name of the project is

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,240
checked out but you know so i'm planning

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,040
to create

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,920
a separate one for that and uh maybe in

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,599
the future if uh

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,400
strike releases uh new features in the

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,400
web so

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
we'll see what they can do it's really

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,720
exciting i'm so glad to see

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,320
like you know we've had a question in

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,560
the chat actually about

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,000
um was this a personal project or had it

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,839
been coming from the community and

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,839
that's really exciting that you know

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,200
you've started as a personal project

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,960
you've built it into like an

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,160
organization building this community

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
around it i think that's one of the

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,440
things i love about

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,880
i love saying about open source and i

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,400
know you've only got a few minutes left

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
because you've only got an hour and like

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
again thank you so much for giving us

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,599
um some of your time today on open

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,960
source friday um

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,920
before we um let you go and

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,320
continue on your friday morning what are

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,200
some of your top tips for people who are

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,119
just

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,720
just sitting there in the chat or

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,160
sitting there watching going hey this

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,800
stuff sounds really cool

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,839
i want to be involved too um whether

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,480
that's

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,520
i want to learn view i want to be a

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,280
contributor

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,880
i want to get involved in open source

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
what are some of your tips to people who

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
are sitting there going i want to be

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,400
like

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,880
i want to be like jeff well uh first of

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,160
all the

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,320
the first activity here i guess is to

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,280
find something that you would enjoy

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,880
doing

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,960
so if that's us uh i will assume that uh

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,440
the viewers are all

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,480
developers um if you think this is

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,880
something that uh

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,880
you would be happy to win

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,720
i think that's that's a good starting

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,960
point and then you can just find

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,680
something

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,720

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,280
you know you can just uh start to create

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,240
anything

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,680
you want actually as long as uh you know

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,400
to test the waters it but

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,440
it will work for you and all that you

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,560
can also start by

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,599
uh jumping into uh already existing

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,079
project

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,680
talk to people collaborate with them and

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,359
uh

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,920
yeah and do you have any tips on where

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,319
to go

to start learning vue.js

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,240
right so the the

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,000
documentation is actually really great

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,359
so you can just uh

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,800
go ahead and to their website and uh

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,839
yeah i think it's a pretty

00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
self-explanatory here so just follow the

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,240

i promise your djs is really easy and uh

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,720
i'm sure you will get uh started in just

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,880
a few minutes

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,079
it sounds really good i think yeah like

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,520
as i mentioned i

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,839
started learning a bit of view and it's

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,599
been really exciting and really easy to

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,720
to jump in and grab a hold so yeah i

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,839
