00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,439
and um i've been maintaining

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,920
open source full time for

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
uh quite a bit over two years now like

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,640
almost two and a half years

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,759
um yeah

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,360

you you maintain uh adversel um

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
which is formerly zeit so it's gonna

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
i'll probably flub a bit

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,439
too as well as i call it zeit and

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
vercell um but you're on the next js

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,879
team so

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
how did you sort of get your get your

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,120
way into versailles and how did you get

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
your way into sort of

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,400
being the the maintainer and co-creator

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
of a couple different projects

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,440
yeah so i i basically started

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,400
my software development career

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,400
uh relatively young i was 18 years old

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
magento that kind of stuff uh see that

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,200
i'm cutting out a bit but oh well

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,280
um so yeah so i was working there

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
and in my free time i was basically like

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
still learning a lot of

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,200
like javascript i was very interested in

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,720
it i was mostly doing like back and for

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
php at the time

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
so um i recently got involved in

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
a bunch of open source projects like

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
just helping out so like for example

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
like

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
solving good first issue labeled issues

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,519
and that kind of stuff

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,920
um or just helping out forever basically

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
like

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
uh

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,920
helping out people that kind of thing uh

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
helping i don't slack

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
in like forgotten communities that kind

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,319
of thing um

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
and in doing so i basically

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,319
like i started contributing quite

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
heavily to hyper

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,840
and building plug-ins for hyper i burst

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,280
this terminal that uh

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,599
versailles built um back in like mid

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,599
2016 or so it was released

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,120
and shortly after that i started

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,560
contributing to it

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,480
um and after a few months of doing that

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,760
like all in my free time basically um i

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,920
uh like kissimo the ceo for sale

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
resets me was like hey we're working on

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,560
this new project called uh nextgs

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
um and since you're doing like all this

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,519
php stuff you might find it interesting

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
because you're building like this full

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,480
stack

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,920
ish solution for building front ends

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,120
so it's like oh cool i have luke um

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
and then i basically started

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
contributing to that also um

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,880
and eventually shifted focus to like

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,639
only contributing to

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,639
nexus um yeah this is all like

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
still in my free time like working full

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
time and then next to it all

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,080
working on open source um

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,400
and then eventually i conservative

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,840
so much that they were like hey we'd

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
like to make you a co-author of the

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,320
framework

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
um so that happened and then a few

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
months later

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,560
i think i i reset to the family was like

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
hey

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
if you ever like want to hire someone to

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
work on this stuff or whatever

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,080
like please reach out to me because i'd

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
be super interested

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,199
um and then like a few months passed by

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
again

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,960
um and he was like hey do you want to

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,759
come to san francisco for our first

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
conference or

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
organizing um i had never been on a

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,919
plane before which was interesting

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,919
um yeah i had never traveled alone

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,240
like all that kind of stuff but it's

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,479
like okay oh

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,199
i'll see if i can go um and then

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,720
eventually that happened

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
got offered a job which i didn't take

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,320
for

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,919
various reasons um but then a few months

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,240
later i was like hey i really want to do

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,360
this

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,600
like open source stuff uh because next

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,639
growing a bit uh more adoptive and

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,680
larger companies that kind of stuff

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,720
and then i was like hey i

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,199
like if you still want to hire me um

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,479
then i'd be super up for it um and then

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,320
i eventually got hired

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,520
like at the end of 2018 i think you know

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,199
2017 actually

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,680
um and yeah ever since then i've been at

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
for sale um working on next year

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
full-time

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,560
uh and in doing so like

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,360
build a bunch of other of projects also

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
yeah so

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
between the time of your good first

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,560
issues uh in the time you were

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
sort of approached to get hired the

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
first time like what's the time span

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,919
between that

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,520
it was like over the course of like six

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,960
months or so

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,199
wow yeah if i had been like just

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,639
basically i started uh contributing

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,880
because i wanted to learn

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,160
more about react uh so i had learned

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
react through

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,280
basically reading the um hyper source

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,199
code

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,919
cyprus built on react also um

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
and then like they say i just only kept

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
going because i was like oh

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
i'm actually learning a lot of stuff

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,759
that i like didn't know from working

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,880
at this company i was working at at the

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,639
time

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,280
so eventually they offered me a job yeah

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
to work on it yeah that's that's wild

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,720
and i think that's uh

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
i mean i'm not sure about all all

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,759
stories and open source

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
onboarding but i think it's similar to

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
mine like i didn't get hired to do open

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,319
source at the first company i worked at

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,080
but my interest in learning how the

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
projects were made and how to sort of

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
like

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
contribute back to the things i was

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
using pretty heavily is a similar

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
onboarding experience for a lot of

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
people

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
um around getting an open source and i

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,520
think that's actually pretty

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,160
pretty awesome to say that um everybody

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,160
everybody wants to like get a job and

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,880
everybody wants to level up their career

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
but they're all super like unclear of

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
like what pastor i

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,280
am and i think open source is like a

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,440
really cool path to approach

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
if you want to get a job at a company um

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,479
there are a ton of companies that are

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
doing open source so like

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
for sale is like not the only one out

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
there that's doing this um

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,199
like github's another one that does this

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,240
um there

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
yeah there's quite a few of them out

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,160
there and like the um

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
i'm glad that there's a way uh that uh

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
companies can actually put their stuff

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
out there

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,319
and have people participate in that too

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
as well

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,479
yeah yeah for me it was mostly like

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
american open source was like a hobby

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,120
for me

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,599
um but then like i i basically

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,520
like got offered to turn my hobby into a

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,919
job right so

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,919
um

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
but um if like you get to work on open

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,080
source or whatever

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
um you still have like all the

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
contributions that you did

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,360
are very public right so uh even if i

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
would go to like

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
i'd also like for example like in that

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,640
time frame there were companies that

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,560
were using next for example

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,399
and i knew it wasn't working at uh for

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,519
sale at the time so

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
they reached out to me they were like

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
hey we want to offer you a job to work

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
on

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
like our next yes apps right um

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
so even that was like one of the

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
possibilities i had

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,200
back then um just one con from

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
conservating a lot to

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
a certain project but it doesn't have to

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,040
be like next for example it could be

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,440
like any project that is used by

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
uh larger companies or even like smaller

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,560
companies that just

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,480
like do agency stuff on top of it yeah

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,160
so i'm actually i want to transition us

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,279
into uh

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,360
talking about uh the project um i'm

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,080
curious if you could explain next js

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
i guess and uh a sound bite or maybe a

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
paragraph

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,600
like what is next.js and like what is

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
what's it for its purpose

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,000
yeah so our tech line is on getup is

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
basically the react framework for

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
production

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
but uh the like more lengthy explanation

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,080
is that

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,920
building react apps is really hard um

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
if you do it all like manually like

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,320
setting up all your

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,279
uh like build tools like figuring out

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,839
how to do writing

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,480
figuring out how to try to do data

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,480
loading

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
and even if you figure all that out it's

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
still really hard to

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,000
get performance right for example and do

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
pre-rendering like service or rendering

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,920
or static generation

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,760
um so next basically comes in there and

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
it's like a framework that you use to

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
build react apps

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
um so this is either like websites or

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,240
web applications

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,160
and it basically helps you with like

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,079
guiding you towards a

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,040
part that makes your app the most

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,160
performant it can be using react

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,920
and optimizes a lot of stuff

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,279
in the background for you like it

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
focuses basically on

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,640
providing a good user experience but

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
also a good developer experience

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
so the developer experience part is

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
there like

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,640
automatic culture reloading like um

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,079
giving you really nice set tracers like

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
that kind of stuff is all like in the

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,519
premise of what next helps you do

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
basically

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,760
yeah and there's a yeah just looking at

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
this uh i'm sharing the screen as well i

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
haven't shared it to you but i'm looking

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
at the next js

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,680
homepage and there's quite a few of

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
people including twitch actually who

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
just

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,399
stream right by who are using next in

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
production too as well so

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
not only is this an open source project

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
but this is a project that's actually

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
being leveraged by a ton of companies

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,800
too as well

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
which is a yeah yeah it's pretty cool

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,720
yeah so

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,399
it's the nexus being used by um like

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
tons of alexa top 100 uh or so companies

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,480
which is like

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,800
really massive websites um

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
so think like the scale of like

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
instagram

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,720
uh those are not using next but like uh

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,440
for example the um

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,279
like largest news website in china uh

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,560
qq.com is using next

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,720
for its mobile platform um

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
which is like the fifth largest or so

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,040
website of the internet

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,320
according to the alexa ranking um so

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,839
it's like it goes from like

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,079
really massive companies um

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,760
to like very small websites like your

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
personal website like for example my

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,519
personal website

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,639
um or like a blog or something like that

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,959
but yeah you have like the whole

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,959
spectrum of different companies using it

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,800
yeah so curious if we can transition

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,519
into um

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,880
the actual github repo as well so let me

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,959
go ahead and uh

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,959
transition to sharing my screen as well

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,240
so that way you can see the see this in

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
real time and

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
everybody else can see this in real time

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,800
so i got

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,240
the github repo open up here and i'm

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
curious of

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,160
like if if i walk into this thing uh

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,760
first time

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,360
like what do i do to i guess be the next

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,399
tim notkins as well to find good first

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
issues like what's what's

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,279
what's first step if i want to

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,480
participate and learn how to use next

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,760
yeah so um basically we have

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
three tabs uh like issues pull requests

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
and discussions

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,480
um discussions is something new that

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,959
we're working on with the github team

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
actually

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,200
um so like the first thing that you

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,639
could do if you want to contribute

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,320
code um is

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
or if you want to contribute like to the

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
community itself is using

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,279
discussions to basically help out other

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
people right like

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,079
someone ask asks a question uh you might

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,279
have the answer to that question

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,959
um because you've been using next or you

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
are like starting to learn it and you

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,680
want to figure that out for someone else

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
so a lot of people ask questions on

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,760
discussions

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,399
and it's either like how do we do this

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,399
or how do we do that

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,120
that kind of stuff and it allows you to

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,680
basically like

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
engage with other community members uh

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,720
that have questions or

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,399
like want to discuss some like new

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,959
features for example

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,320
uh and give your like input back

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,320
basically

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
then besides that if you want to like

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,600
contribute actual code

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,279
um you can use the uh issues

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
tab where like you have a good first

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,800
issues label

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,000
so one of the uh things that we do is we

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,680
mark issues that

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,040
are like relatively easy to do

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,240
um like there there is a spectrum there

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,600
even like oh

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
i'm actually like really experienced

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,680
with like this whole like reacts

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,560
and uh compiler thing so you can help

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
out there too

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,199
but the most basic thing is like helping

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,199
fix examples for example

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,279
so we tried to mark a lot of issues as

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
good first issue

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,560
and there's actually a lot of people

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,160
that come in and just help out

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,959
other people that have issues or

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,800
people that want to like make changes to

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,240
examples that they don't know how to for

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,959
example

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
awesome yeah i'm curious of um and this

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
is uh

pop in and say if you're a next.js user

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
if you have experience in react

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,120
i'm curious of what the gauge uh

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
engagement we have or even the

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
opportunity we have today

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,600
uh for people looking to contribute

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,959

you guys actually purposely uh use green

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,160
for uh good first issues and help wanted

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
yeah yeah so a good first issue is

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
generally

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,040
like we generally mark them both because

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
um

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,320
most of the issues are actually like a

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,959
good first issue that you can help on

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
um but like things that are only marked

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,720
help wanted

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,320
so no good first issue are like slightly

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,839
harder to do for example

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,240
um but still like requiring more effort

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
or like more uh knowledge of the

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,800
framework

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,399
um but besides that we tried to market

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,199
like many uh issues that are really easy

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,240
to do

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,079
as good first issue so that we um

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,560
can basically like free up our own time

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
to work on like larger features and that

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,320
kind of thing

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,680
awesome and that something i actually i

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
told you about this before we jumped

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
online

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,320
but uh if you went to that same uh

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,440
uh repo and slashed uh put slash

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
contribute

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
um which i'll put that in the chat for

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,639
anybody who did not

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,639
catch that but um actually i'm gonna

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
drop this url in the chat completely

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,880
so everybody can follow along it thinks

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,519
it's the command

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,079
um yeah so github recently shipped a

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,320
feature

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,240
probably earlier february where they're

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
using machine learning to not only find

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
good first issues and help wanted

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,240
so like we do see a lot of green uh but

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,440
we do see a couple of these ones where

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,040
you see example

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,880
and it's because the machine learning

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,240
sort of inferring that these are

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
even though they're not labeled or they

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,560
are labeled good first issue but

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,040
um i think this one down here which is

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,920
only documentation this one's labeled

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,720
as a contra like a good first issue to

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,519
contribute

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
uh because it's documentation so um if

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,160
anybody's interested in sort of like

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,120
jumping on the bandwagon

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
and participating in naxton who knows

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,280
maybe you can also be

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,600
a co-maintainer or have a a

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
nice career at uh or versailles working

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,839
on that full-time as well

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,679
so yeah definitely check that out um but

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,280
before we jump into some of these issues

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,760
i wanted to see if you can help us give

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,520
like a tour of the repo itself because i

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,400
know this is built on react

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,760
but uh my some of my issues for

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,559
contributing open source is that i just

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,799
have nowhere to

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,919
know like where to begin like i've never

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,799
worked on this

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
next.js project i don't know like i know

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
there's some

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,799
examples i know there's a getting

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,160
started guide so like let's make the

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,880
assumption that someone's built

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,559
an xjs app or they know react but they

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
want to contribute to the project

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,120
um but they just don't know how to sort

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
of navigate um the code structure so

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,840
what are some like good tips for people

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,400
to for navigating the code base

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,120
yeah so uh the very first thing that you

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
have to do

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
because otherwise you just can't run

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
like some of our tests for example is

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,039
like go to the contributing data md

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,400
um which is right here there yeah

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,280
um and like the first thing that you

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,720
have to do

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,559
uh if you scroll down a little bit more

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,720
um because this is just installing the

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,000
repo okay but if you want to run the

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,280
test you actually have to

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,320
uh install chrome driver interesting

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,400
like we basically uh install

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,679
uh like we run tests into end tests

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,720
that are basically running

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,919
a full browser like full chrome or

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,799
full firefox for example

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,440
and chrome driver basically helps you

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,200
run

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
chrome through like this

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,799
interoperability layer

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
um so that has to be installed or

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,440
actually control the test

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
um but besides that everything else is

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,160
just like running yarn

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,000
and then yarn depth and it works um

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,760
as explained in like a little bit

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,520
further up the uh contributing to the nd

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,600
uh but let's just dive into the code

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
base because uh that's probably like

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,480
more interesting to go through

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
um yeah so going back to the the home

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
page

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
i've got a bunch of i got a couple dot

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,600
files vs code files which is pretty cool

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
yeah

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,240
yeah so um basically the dot get up like

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
contains all the

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
the github related configurations so

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,200
that's not really interesting um

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,400
but speak for yourself configuration

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,039
yeah just kidding no like

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
the those configuration files that

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
generally don't change right that's what

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,919
i meant basically

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,919
um so like they they contain like the

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,720
give actions that we use and all that

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
kind of stuff

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,280
um infuse code is just if you're using

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
vs code it like has some extra rules

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,760
there

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,400
um bench is not used uh directly by

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,679
users

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,480
uh but the most interesting folders are

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,880
docs errors examples and packages and

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,919
tests of course

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,039
so starting with docs those are

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,720
obviously the documentation of next if

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,039
you make a change there it automatically

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,280
reflects on the website if it goes

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,000
too stable um so we have a docs

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,280
uh section on the website uh as you're

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,440
showing

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,200
um and it also is like index through

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,919
augolia so if you like search for

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,080
anything

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,039
uh in the search bar uh it will

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,880
automatically like

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,480
find that update that you made for

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,520
example

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,840
okay excellent so yeah that works super

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,280
well

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,799
um and you mentioned that this is

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
indexed by algolia is that what you

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,320
sorry you cut out for a little bit yeah

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,799
okay awesome

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,880
yeah so we like run actually we run that

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,960
through github action so like if you

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,159
uh do a new commit it actually runs

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,400
through get up action then

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,159
like indexes that new content basically

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
really sorry i'm going to take a timeout

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
just to look at that

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,480
is that action live right here in the

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,080
github folder

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,120
um i am not exactly sure i think it

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,280
lives in the

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,480
um the next site repo which is a

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,320
separate repo but

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
um well good to know that they're yeah

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
because sometimes that's another thing

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,120
that could be confusing is knowing

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,640
if i'm looking at this site how do i

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,640
make an edit

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
to this dock and this you're evening the

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,200
old docks live here okay

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
but is there a way for me to know that

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,600
there's two different

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,919
repo yeah so if you scroll all the way

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,720
down you actually get a edit and get up

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
um i got it down here yeah so you can do

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
that

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
um but and that gets you the

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,799
the exact like location inside of the

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,840
docs folder um

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,360
that that page refers to right um so

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,280
first you have to like focus repo et

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,760
cetera et

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,559
that you cetera actually fork this uh

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,840
directly

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,840
yeah yeah awesome yeah yeah so this is

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,200
all using the the normal ui but

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,280
um yeah let's go back to the

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,840
the folders yeah so we were back here

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,280
yeah so if you go one pack uh because

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,159
this is just the documentation right

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
like these are the

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,600
separate uh directories uh for that

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,480
um so then you have errors which is an

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,559
interesting

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
uh thing that we have in most result

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,600
projects

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,320
uh we have like this error dot sh links

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
that allow you to basically like link to

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,159
a

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,640
uh markdown file inside of the git of

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,720
repo

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,480
yeah and that's called errors so if you

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
go to error.sage slash

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,360
next year slash like 404

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,919
get uh i couldn't read the rest of the

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,200
thing but

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,600
like any of the urls here they will work

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,360
and inside the code base we use these to

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
like if there's a warning

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,760
or error we try to always give you a

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,039
link that gives you more context to that

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,679
error

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,320
okay because like generally like this

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
message

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,000
uh if there is an error drone is not

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,559
super clear

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,919
to users like oh you forgot this

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,880
configuration or whatever

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,520
um but then you can actually like see

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
like oh

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,840
how can i fix this or uh should i do

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
something else and that kind of thing

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,480
yeah that's clever

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
did you get this from another project or

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,039
how did who discovered to

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
sort of have your error templates built

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,559
into the project like this

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
i think i think it was based on the

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,559
react

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,720
um like the idea like that react has

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,880
is that uh they also show you like

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,799
minifigure minified errors

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,240
so they basically like give you a link

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,960
every time an error is thrown

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,080
in production uh but we actually like

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
expanded that to

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,200
like just in development we also show

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,120
these okay awesome

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
um because it gives a lot of extra

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
context to like

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,640
what you can do so yeah let's go back to

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
the overview

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,720
oh sorry let's go outside

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,880
yeah we talked about docs we talked

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,799
about errors yeah

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,520
yeah so then you have examples which is

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,600
an uh directory of nexus examples

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
uh it's a massive directory that's like

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,679
200 examples

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,960
yeah it is very it's like all these

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,200
different things that you can do

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,960
with next like integrating with some

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,039
other libraries right like

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
how can i use stealth components or how

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,000
can i use redux or how can i use

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,799
apollo or that kind of stuff and this

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,720
directory

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,679
holds all those examples on how to like

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,520
do these integrations basically

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
uh and this is like what most people

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,000
contribute to because this is like

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,760
very easy to do for uh if you've used

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,559
next before like these are all just next

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
steps

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
yeah uh that you can like make changes

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,360
too basically

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,039
um so yeah uh let's go

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,640
through like how to set it up and that

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
kind of thing um yeah

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
that's well real quick i think that's

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
super clever

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,960
to have your examples also live right

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
next to your code

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,720
and it's also i appreciate you

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,799
mentioning that too as well because like

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,240
people might not know where to start um

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
it might not maybe they want to change

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
the documentation

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,120
but there's no real good or hard doc

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,919
problems that they want to

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
tackle yeah but i imagine like between

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,320
uh

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,799
i think next js did they have a version

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,880
that was out in the

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,240
so yeah what 9.3 so i imagine between

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,120
9.3

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,720
and 8 8.0 like there are some changes

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,400
that need to also up be updated and

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
reflected in all these

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,840
so is there like a normally a call out

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
for con uh

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,240
contributors or to help with the yeah so

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,240
we

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
yeah we did this for 9.3 because that

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
was a really massive release like we

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
we changed one of the data fetching

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,240
methods so you basically have like two

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
variants like one is get static probes

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,080
when it's got server-side props

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,080
and basically we had to like update all

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,120
the uh existing examples

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,880
to not use get initial props um

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,200
so what was interesting though is we

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
created an issue

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,840
that was marked good first issue and

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,760
then i tweeted about it and like within

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,039
i think like four hours or something

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,039
like

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,480
we had put requests for like almost

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,559
every example there was

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,919
really wow um because people just like

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,120
jumped in and they were like oh yeah i

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
can do this because it's

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
like i've actually done this before i

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,720
know what i'm good like

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,240
how i can do this um for like most of

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,799
the examples

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,559
uh that's also why we have like 94 open

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,320
pull requests right now because

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,600
we just have tons of example updates

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
that we still have to merge and go

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,840
through and like review and that kind of

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,320
thing

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,919
um but we obviously like keep up to date

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,039
because like we work on this full time

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,320
um but there's like a constant ever

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,600
since that release like there's a

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,279
constant stream of new

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,679
for requests which is quite interesting

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,400
that's awesome yeah and i'm just looking

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,760
at i

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,200
failed to mention too as well like this

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,960
this project's got 47 000 stars

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
and uh i didn't actually catch the how

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,000
many contributors are there but like

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,480
this is a over thousand yeah yeah this

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,960
is uh yeah that's that's that's amazing

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,400
they have so much activity and so much

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,600
so many pull requests to actually review

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,760
are you reviewing all those pull

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,760
requests every day

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,000
yes wow like my my get up notifications

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,919
are

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
like over 100 every day or something

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,919
like that for next

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,480
uh and it's only next like not even like

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,240
internal for sale stuff or whatever so

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,720
yeah um but

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,480
yeah it's manageable uh i'm really happy

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,159
about the new notifications ui

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,480
because that really helps because i can

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,399
like filter down on notifications now

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,440
which i couldn't do before um

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,799
but yeah it's it's a lot of work

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,480
but we obviously like try to keep up to

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,039
date on like all the issues all the

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,760
requests uh there's just a lot of

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,799
traffic like

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,720
if you get to the like if you build a

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,000
project and it has like

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,960
some traction um you you get a lot of

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,640
uh issues etc but once you get to like

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,960
this kind of scale of project

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
it just becomes like a constant stream

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,000
of updates basically

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,919
um but

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,039
yeah we we tried to go through all the

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,240
issues and all the

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,880
requests and basically every discussion

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,320
also

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,159
uh just to make sure that like

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,000
everything's up to date

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,799
um yeah that's a daily

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
job for us yeah for sure yeah it sounds

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,960
like you need um

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,640
you need some like triage interns or um

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,559
some open source contributors to

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,559
to be your triage in the morning at

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,080
least find somebody that's uh the time

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,720
zone be before you so that we don't have

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,320
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,279
uh prs to go through

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,960
yeah so i'm i've been mostly doing like

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,840
uh because i have a team of like

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
four or five people now uh at for sale

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,200
so

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,279
they all work on next but i try to do

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,559
the triaging myself

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,480
because i'm actually in the time zone

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,559
before all of them like before

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
they all get online like i have six or

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,919
seven hours or so

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
uh so i try to go through them all so

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,039
that i can like pick out like critical

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,640
bugs or whatever and then then i can

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,960
basically ask my team like hey can you

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
like

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
look into this or fix this um next to

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
like the

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
normal road map that we're working on

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,720
basically

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,720
very cool so yeah so we talked about

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
examples and uh sorry i had to digress

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
you into i just thought that was super

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,640
fascinating that that's a nice little

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
entry point for individuals to start

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,760
contributing is there a pathway like do

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,120
you see

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,559
um individuals who might not work for

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,200
versailles or zeit

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,159
and um end up showing up like on a

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
regular basis

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,000
as far as contributions like are there

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,760
any sort of next experts that are out

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,640
there

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,159
yeah so there's uh on discussions we get

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520
a lot of people that are actually like

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,559
helping out other people

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,960
uh very consistently um

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
on pro requests and issues like we we

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
get less so

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,880
like the same people but some like

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
there's probably like six or seven

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,919
people that are very active still

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,720
um on like all the requests all the

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,240
issues

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,679
um if it relates to their work mostly

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,440
um and

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,360
yeah yeah so so we have a bunch of

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,559
people that are are very consistently

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,480
contributing

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,000
uh through either like leaving comments

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,600
or that kind of thing

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,919
um and yeah it's it's

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,760
like overall you see a lot of um

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
like dressed in contributors like

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
there's new consumers that come in

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,840
and other contributors that like might

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,000
not contribute anymore or

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,799
um they're like just like working on

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,039
other stuff basically

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,919
but overall we see a lot of people that

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,600
like consistently keep using next

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,159
across like multiple projects that they

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,200
do and that kind of thing

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,480
excellent so outside of examples i guess

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
that we want to keep going down there

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
let's go back

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,640
yeah then a little trick yeah so here

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,240
here's where it gets interesting uh so

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,720
we have packages and tests

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,840
so let's first go into packages so in

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,320
the context of nyx what's uh what is a

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,440
package

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,919
yeah so packages is uh so we use learner

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,640
for um the managing of our monorepo

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,159
so uh packages in next is just like npm

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,720
packages

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,200
so all the uh directories that you see

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,840
here are npm packages

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,000
um so in this case like the main thing

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,480
that we're looking at is generally next

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
right like the next package um which is

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,799
what everyone installs whatever uses

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
uh but we also have like create next app

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,360
for example

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,919
which creates uh nexus apps

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,360
if you start out a project for example

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,000
um so yeah let's first go into next

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
the rest are by the way plugins or like

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
other add-ons that

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
we build on top of next basically so

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,039
wait sorry

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,000
so this is the the package version of

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,320
next so we were just on an xjs repo

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,200
but this is what's going to be up on npm

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,440
yep gotcha okay yes

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,279
yeah so the next repo like it started

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,679
out being like one

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,799
repo with like all the the director like

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,080
all these directories were basically in

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,559
the top level

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,000
uh but as time went by we basically like

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:17,039
started adding other

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,760
um like plugins for example right

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,679
um and those are moved into like the

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
same monorepo basically so we have like

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,240
this

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,760
like not very large mono refill because

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,919
like most of our code is inside of the

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,440
next package

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,080
because we try to build in all the

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,600
features that we want instead of like

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,600
attacking them on in separate packages

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,679
but this is basically the like actual

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,120
next code that everyone uses

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,399
if you install next okay

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,039
excellent that's good to know too

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,519
because i've done some some work in open

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,440
source

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,799
and uh and also like sort of try to

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,279
debug problems

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,960
so i'm always a little bit confused when

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,120
it comes to like how different projects

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,080
sort of packaged a project and like

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,559
deployed their versions npm um so i

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
usually

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,360
it's usually me hitting a bunch of

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,159
ceilings and then asking a lot of

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,640
questions

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,159
the people who maybe have experience

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,240
with next or even just asking questions

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
within the in the issues but it's nice

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,679
to see this sort of laid out

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,279
uh to understand that if you do have an

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,440
issue perhaps on

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,880
a certain version and i wonder what the

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,519
if these are packaged

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,919
um how do you go about the diversion or

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,840
do you

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
then every time you do a new release

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,120
then you update these packages is that

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:33,120
i guess the way it goes yeah so

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,840
uh lerna does uh like that's an npm

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,760
library

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
uh that you can install to manage your

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,320
monorepo

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,159
and that basically also manages cross

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,159
dependency dependencies

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,120
so for example if

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,760
the next package depends on

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,519
another package from the like next month

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,360
repo

00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:02,159
it will actually um like update those

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,480
versions also while publishing

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,679
so an example of that is that like we

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,320
have like a

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,679
like one package uh if you go back to

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,119
the the next repo

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,119
uh i can probably show you

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,119
so if you go back to packages

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,919
um you basically see like one

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,520
uh that is called next polyfill no

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,000
module

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,760
um and that one package which is

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,200
separated out

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,280
um is a dependency of next so

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,440
basically like if you install next it

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,200
installs this package too

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,359
and what learner does is it basically um

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,599
updates this version so if you release

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,000
like uh

00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,399
9.3.7 it will update the next

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,560
package version for next polyfill no

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,639
module also

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,399
uh which is super useful because like we

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,440
obviously can't do this manually because

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,440
if we do that

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,040
it will definitely like we'll screw it

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
up sometime and then like all the

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
packages depending on the next little

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,200
break

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,599
or all the projects yeah faster so

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,520
yeah so that's all like automated out

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,720
and then our release cycle itself

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,760
is um we basically

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,920
use get up releases as our mark for

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,200
oh we're going to release a new version

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,040
and we do this with

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,359
pre-releases and um

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
stable reduces so the pre-releases are

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,320
called canary

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,040
releases okay um and we do those very

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,520
often like

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,119
almost every few hours uh if we're

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,280
working on something

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,400
um and these allow you to basically like

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,680
install next

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
at canary to try out new features

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,520
and try out new like bug fixes patches

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,680
yeah that kind of thing

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,280
so this allows us to like if you report

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,720
a bug for example

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,560
to provide a patch and then basically

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,000
release it immediately to like the

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,480
canary branch

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,920
and then someone can actually verify if

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,720
it works for their app

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,359
without us needing to like have access

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,040
to their app

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,960
like try it out that kind of thing um

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,040
so this is really useful because like

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,160
building next from source is like kind

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,599
of hard to do

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,200
um as it depends on like a bunch of

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,320
other projects and that kind of thing

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,880
um so this allows us to like basically

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,560
have

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,680
a faster iteration uh loop for

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,839
us to like leverage basically

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,119
yeah i appreciate yeah this is like i

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,800
wasn't sure what to expect

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,200
and uh doing these open source friday

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,720
chats but i'm like just blown away on

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,800
you just sort of explaining the the

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,400
process and how you manage projects

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,400
or manage this project because i've

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,320
never i've worked on some large

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
applications but not to the scale of

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,880
next

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,160
and not to the scale of how many people

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,119
are actually installing it and

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,359
downloading it

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,960
are you um do you know the offhand how

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,960
many uh npm downloads this thing is

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,920
getting

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,560
like i don't know i can look it up

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
actually

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,119
um let me see cool and i just want to

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
also um just uh

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,880
while you're doing that just mentioned

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,240
uh stewie had mentioned uh in the chat

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,480
studio 443

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,720
um sort of this also being blown away by

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,599
the examples uh earlier

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,320
as well so yeah i appreciate you uh

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,720
mentioning that

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,599
um also if anybody has any questions for

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,520
us we're gonna

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,800
take a break at the end to answer any

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,400
questions so

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,040
keep those in mind uh you do have tim

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
here uh who is the maintainer for

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,000
next.js so if you have any next-gen

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,000
questions so i looked it up and it's um

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,920
so it's 546 000 downloads per week

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,000
um and

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
yeah so so that's quite a lot of users

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,480
yeah i mean that's that's

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,520
if something breaks we know it

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,760
immediately so um

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,440
we basically like what we do is we have

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,440
a very elaborate test suite

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,599
that does like almost only end-to-end

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,480
testing so that means like we run it

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,200
like we're in the actual next command we

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,520
boot it up

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,520
as like the next step server and we run

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,640
like an actual browser as a chrome for

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,760
example

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,320
uh that does all the testing for you

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,640
um and that's all run in ci so like in

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,079
get actions but also azure pipelines for

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,599
windows support

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,960
so we actually like uh test it out

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,680
on like windows mac

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,440
and then also in multiple browsers so

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,560
like one of the browsers is

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
um like one of the extra batch so it's

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,200
obviously chrome

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,599
but then next to chrome we also run into

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,119
firefox safari and uh internet explorer

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,359
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,359
in order to like make sure that things

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,280
don't break between versions for

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,640
like most of the users yeah and remind

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,720
me how is that testing

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,839
happening uh it's in the test directory

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,119
oh that was the uh

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,040
yeah yeah oh we haven't got the test

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,320
directory yeah so we have saved

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,320
we'll save that after we get that with

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,960
packages but um

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
yeah the package thing uh super

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
fascinating

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,040
i'm glad to have that sort of insight uh

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
i don't have any next

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,720
actually i have one next project uh but

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,839
i don't really touch it very often

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,240
but i am looking to update my uh my main

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,680
site

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,400
brian douglas. me so uh i'm on the uh

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,839
on the prowl for for projects to mainly

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,000
react projects to uh

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,280
support debts but you are you're

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,640
convincing me

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,960
now that i know how to contribute to

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,920
this that perhaps nexus

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,480
might be the way to go yeah so if you go

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,680
into the

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,720
the next directory um

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,079
you'll you'll basically like get

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,839
um we have to wait a bit

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,520
so if you go into packages and then the

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,839
next directory

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,839
um

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
sorry is it one more time the next

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
directory oh yeah i

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
probably could add if you go to packages

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
and then the next directory oh gosh

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,079
which is literally

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,680
next yeah gotcha

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
yeah it can be confusing naming

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,920
sometimes naming is hard

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,440
yeah that in cash and validation those

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,640
are the two hardest problems

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,920
so um yeah so in in here we basically

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,440
have all the

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,640
like actual code for next uh so they

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,119
this goes from the development server to

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,160
the

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,280
like build pipeline uh production

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,160
build server and that kind of thing um

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,079
so all of the uh because you see a lot

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,720
of files in the main directory right

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,640
yeah

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,400
so these are all the files that are

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,920
published to npm

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,680
and they have to be in the top level

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,560
because like you import next

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,920
slash link for example right yeah and

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,720
then those like basically

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,319
require from like another place in the

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,119
repository

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,400
in the directory structure um but it

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,280
basically goes from like

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,839
bin is basically like the next command

00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,520
um

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,280
so like the actual like next command

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,240
that you run

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,359
um and that imports from another

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,839
directory

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:12,880
so you basically see the

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,319
references to cli

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,440
if you go back and then go into the cli

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,000
directory

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,280
it's in at the top of the yeah page yeah

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,440
there

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,319
um and those are like the separate next

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,160
commands

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,240
okay so you have next build next dev

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,280
next export next start

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,400
um and these are the ones that are like

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,440
actually executing the code so here we

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,920
import like

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,040
for start we import server lib start

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,200
server

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,119
and that boots up the next production

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,000
server

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,440
um and then like that is like where all

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
the code lives that actually like

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
handles your requests like

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,960
server renders reacts and that kind of

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
thing

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,920
awesome

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,839
just lost you oh there you are

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,880
no i was just silenced for a second yeah

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,960
it's like you're really thinking about

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,960
it

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,040
yeah so like uh besides that

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,720
there is like the the production build

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,079
of course so if you go back to the the

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,119
next directory

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,920
um we also have like a very

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,359
like complicated build pipeline uh that

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,040
builds on top of webpack

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,800
okay uh so that's all in the build

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,880
directory

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,880
uh so like the naming of the directories

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,440
are pretty straightforward like we

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,280
put everything for a certain command

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,720
into a certain directory

00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,160
um and this like i think the versailles

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,560
the naming for a lot of the projects are

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,520
pretty like now is pretty

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,480
pretty concise so i appreciate naming uh

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,680
that's been coming out of

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,680
a lot of your projects as well

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,960
yeah so we tried to keep it as simple as

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,359
possible um so basically the

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:07,040
the build directory like holds all the

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,560
infrastructure that is needed for um

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,319
running your production build and

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,240
running your development build so like

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,119
our webpack configuration you can like

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,160
find it here

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:22,640
uh it's in webeconfig.ts yeah um

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:26,560
it's massive yeah uh warning

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,359
no but like overall um

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,359
it adds a bunch of like custom epic

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,440
plugins that we use for next

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,280
um and it solves a bunch of like books

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:41,839
that we had with like server rendering

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,839
uh using webpack and kind of thing

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,720
so yeah um and then like besides that

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,119
there is like a bunch of other

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,079
directories like export for doing static

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,200
exporting and

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,920
like all that so cool well i think

00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,319
that's like

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,480
a good peruse through packages uh i'm

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,599
excited to actually talk about testing

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,040
now and sort of how next yeah does

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,200
testing because as you mentioned like

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,400
all the cross browser testing

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,880
i mentioned you also have to test

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,960
different versions of perhaps node

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,160
because maybe some people are on 12 or

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,480
10 or

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,000
maybe eight and trying to do this so is

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,079
that all accomplished yes

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,599
within here yeah yeah for sure so we

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,599
test against the lowest note mark so

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,920
that is note

00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,560
10.13 or something like the lts release

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,680
basically

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,520
um which is the one that we support

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,090
so like anything after that works in

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,880
node.js so that's good

00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:42,960
[Music]

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,800
and then we basically test through

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,520
mostly the integration test suite so

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,160
that's in the integration directory

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,839
so if you go into there because the rest

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,240
is all like mostly

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,760
um like separate tests for like very

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,680
specific cases

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,599
but these are the most common ones that

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,720
we write so

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,200
um in general like if you look at

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,839
any of these directories you can open

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,960
any one of them

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,000
just choose one i don't mind which one

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:18,640
so this tests the um s

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,680
path for a certain writer feature

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,599
um so it has a test directory but the

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,359
main interesting thing here is that this

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,680
is just a next app

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,720
so if you look at the like main

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,079
directory of the

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,680
of the um of the test so app

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,480
the app dash s path i gotcha um

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,240
you see a page directory and the pages

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,760
directory is just like the next.js pages

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,640
directory

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,079
and the underscore app and index.js are

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,359
just like normal nexus

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,560
app files okay uh and it looked like

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,000
normal also right

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,920
um the only like

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,160
catcher is that we generally like

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,560
introduce like specific bits that we

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,040
want to test right like um

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,839
in this case we wanted to check if like

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,520
the url

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:11,119
s path um was provided correctly

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,040
in other scrap um so like in index.js we

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,160
just like stringify the prop so that we

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,440
can then read them

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,359
in the tests themselves yeah um

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,119
so what this does is like basically if

00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:25,200
you run this test

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,240
it boots up a next app this next step

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,560
and then it boots up a browser that

00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,440
then fetches like then opens like the

00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,319
the homepage

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,839
of this app right and then what we can

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,760
do is you can basically do like

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,599
assertions based on like

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,400
oh what's the document body or that kind

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:46,079
of thing

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,240
very cool and then the

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,920
this is this all running on is this

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,560
where you start talking about the cross

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,800
browser stuff is that where it comes in

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,319
so that's all the most interesting thing

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,319
is that it's this all happens

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,200
automatically so if you go into the

00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,920
um one good example it's probably the

00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,680
production

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,400
test suite so that's literally the

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:10,160
folder called production

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
so a lot of files yeah so we have tons

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,520
of these

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,960
and these all ensure that we don't break

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,640
next yes features

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,400
uh when we release a new version so we

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,520
have a really high confidence in like

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,559
our test suite uh if you make a new

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,480
change

00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
we basically immediately know if like

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,000
you broke the next app

00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,920
or not um by running all these tests

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,920
so if you go into the test folder here

00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,520
and then into uh dynamic.js for example

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,800
um i think that that was one of the

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,760
cases where it does that

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,680
yeah so we actually have this uh custom

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,960
webdriver

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,079
implementation called next webdriver

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,400
which is provided like in the repo um

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,640
but basically anywhere you see webdriver

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,559
being um

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,839
like for example in line where your

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,319
cursor is right now

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,119
uh browser is a weight web driver right

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,400
yeah that one

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,839
um so that actually boots up a webdriver

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,319
instance

00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,359
and webdriver under the hood basically

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,839
allows you to use

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:19,119
multiple browsers to test against so

00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,440
what we do is basically we have a

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,720
separate test suite for like

00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,680
internet explorer or firefox or safari

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,119
but they all run on the same uh layer

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,200
which is webdriver

00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,680
um selenium and

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,760
those like that basically means that you

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,839
write the tests in the same way always

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,599
um but you can run them on different

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,440
browsers if you want to

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,400
so that's what we do for like a bunch of

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,160
our tests

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,720
awesome yeah that that kind of answers

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,480
my my question on the the cross browser

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,160
sorry i was just distracted by looking

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,720
at my audio level

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,200
it's the uh being uh interviewer and

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,240
producer at the same time it's uh

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,720
all over the place yeah very cool yeah

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,079
so

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,440
what you can see in this test in

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,640
particular the the one that you

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,960
highlighted is that

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,200
like you boot up the browser and it goes

00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,960
to slash dynamics like no chunk

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,319
yeah and then basically there's a like

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,960
some helpers that we built

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,599
that basically just do a loop of

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,480
checking

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,920
if something is set on the body uh

00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,480
called welcome normal

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,400
right and if that doesn't come out it

00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,280
just crashes after like 30 seconds of

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,559
trying

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,400
and then you know that it doesn't work

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,480
anymore yeah um

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,480
like if you make any change in next that

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,920
breaks this behavior you basically know

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,599
it immediately because this is running

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,720
against the real next app

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,119
that uses this feature

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,400
so i'm curious because like i keep going

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,240
back to the fact that you

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,920
between six months of you first doing a

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,079
good first issue and

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,480
being approached to work on this full

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,119
time uh the first time

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,559
was next this sort of like i'm gonna say

00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,960
complicated or

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,400
intuitive or was this project much

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,240
simpler back then

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,400
and uh you sort of built all these sort

00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,640
of systems

00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,839
so this system has been around since the

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,440
i think first stable release okay

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:20,720
um because it was built by arunoda

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,000
um who started contributing to next

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,599
actually very early on

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,160
same as me but eventually he went to do

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,800
other things

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,520
for sale uh so currently he works in

00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,520
like our

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,440
infrastructure like back-end team

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,960
basically um

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,800
on actually one of our github

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,160
integrations and like other things

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,599
um and he

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,319
was very like he's very uh seasoned in

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,079
open source

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,839
like he worked on a lot of meteor

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,440
projects uh and

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,359
like started storybook and that kind of

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,480
thing um

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,960
and he basically was like oh we need to

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,920
have

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,920
enter integration tests for everything

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,280
um so he was basically the one that was

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,240
like

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,839
basically like slamming uh his hand on

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,760
the table being like hey we need to have

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,200
these tests like on every pro request

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,920
that came in like hey you need to add a

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,200
test

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,359
um and because i was not

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,440
that much like that like oh i was like

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,839
oh i just built this feature it works

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,280
right um but then he was like oh you

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,079
need to test this thing

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,520
because otherwise it's going to break um

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,119
and then eventually like i basically

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,160
adopted that style of

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,440
like oh every change has a

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,559
test included um and i basically kept

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,760
enforcing it on other people and

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,440
that basically like gave us

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,839
the shape of the test suite that we

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,920
currently have which allows us to move a

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,880
lot faster because we know if something

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,119
breaks

00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,119
when you make changes because we test

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,200
pretty much every feature that we have

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,160
and if it's not tested or you report it

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,440
back

00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,760
we add a test with your specific case

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,440
um into our test suite because it's

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,559
already real next steps right

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,079
yeah so like if you report a book uh

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
like something is broken or like

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,640
whatever i'm doing this in my app and it

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,119
breaks

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,720
now that i upgrade next we actually add

00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,160
in the same exact

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,079
like that file um

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,599
to test again so that we know that it

00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,440
won't break in the future

00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,720
like you don't come back to us and be

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,640
like hey

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,079
i did this like five months ago i

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,640
referred this to you and now you broke

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,440
it again

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,960
like why are you doing that right um

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
which is obviously not the experience

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,880
that

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:37,839
like open source users want um but it's

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,880
something that you get more often than

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,640
you would expect

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,000
from like most libraries because they

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,880
don't have

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,599
like super complicated test setups uh

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,160
which is

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,000
super logical right because i was also

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,680
like oh why am i going to do all these

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,960
tests if like no one's using it or

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,800
whatever right

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,760
but then like once people start using it

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,599
it actually becomes like reliant on that

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,440
yeah so i'm curious and also conscious

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,160
of time too as well um

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,040
i want to see if we could uh walk

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,480
through a

00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,920
a good first issue as well

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:15,040
um and maybe if you oh looks like i

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,680
spelt contribute wrong i know i deleted

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,800
next

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:21,359
that's what happened there we go

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,680
um and perhaps i i guess one of these

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,359
little exercises if we grabbed an issue

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,839
could you talk out loud like how you

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,440
would approach it perhaps in like maybe

00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,319
give someone like sort of like a

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,079
underhand pitch

00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:35,440
yeah um so perhaps maybe

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,440
i'm not sure i'm not sure how you do

00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,040
this yeah

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,480
okay so the first one was a pretty good

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,960
one to walk through because it's

00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,920
like adding a new functionality to the

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,880
create next step

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,680
okay excellent so in this case this

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,079
person

00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,520
created a book report being like hey i

00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,720
want to

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,760
uh basically send dash e or dashes

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,880
example

00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,240
to create next step uh with the value of

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,119
default

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,760
to basically pick out the default um

00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,280
example

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,119
right so uh

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,800
previously like what we did in like

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,400
older versions of next was like we just

00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,319
gave you the default example

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,240
but now we basically ask you like hey do

00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,680
you want to install this example or

00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,960
do you want to use the default value

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,079
and this is where like this broke

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,040
basically for his use guys because um he

00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,599
wanted to use

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,200
like distant ci or something like that

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,599
um

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,280
so it should basically auto select

00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,920
default

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,559
uh when you do dash e default so

00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,280
basically like

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,400
bypassing that check for hey do you want

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,079
to

00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:49,359
um create a uh example

00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,119
uh do you want to use an example yeah so

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,119
basically i replied like hey we'd be

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,880
happy to like add this functionality

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,860
dash e that def

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,240
e default um

00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,559
[Music]

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,240
so someone already created a podcast for

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,599
this yeah this is

00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:09,040
actually is yeah so this is like some

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,160
like contributor um that is pretty

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,760
active on the project

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,160
and that tries to help out a good first

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
issues um

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,599
but given that we don't have that much

00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,480
time it actually might make sense

00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,079
to like go into this like pull request

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,960
because

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,680
it basically shows like which changes

00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,200
were made

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,680
to make this happen and it wasn't made

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,960
by me right um

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,520
so yeah if you go into the diff you

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,960
basically um

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:42,480
because it's only one file uh so

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,240
create next app um is that package right

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,000
just create next app and that has an

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,440
index.ts which is the

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,280
create next step command um and then

00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,799
what it does is basically it checks if

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,839
um like example is set there

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:03,200
so you have create a create app with the

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:06,480
example parameter um

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,760
online 171 yeah or

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,760
72 now but

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,440
basically what it this allows you to do

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,040
is um

00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,960
provide like which example has to be

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,440
installed

00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,319
so what this like if you don't provide

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,119
an example it

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,960
just assumes that it's the default um

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,000
template

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,960
and so basically what uh

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,280
james if i remember correctly i did was

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,960
yeah

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,079
he moved out the check for that

00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,880
uh to check if it's uh a string

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,599
um and then well obviously it's the same

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,680
code but

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,359
then basically he added in the extract

00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,440
check so example

00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,720
if example exists an example is not

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,319
default then provide

00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:55,119
example and otherwise do undefined

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,359
so what this means is that if the

00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,280
example is set to default

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,480
it will be undefined so it installs the

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,280
default uh

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,040
template awesome and like this seems

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,440
like super approachable too as well

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,960
like uh yeah it does take like knowing

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,040
where to go what to look but

00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,599
the the solutions seem pretty

00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:17,119
straightforward

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,799
yeah so overall um

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,160
like this is just like one one line

00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,559
change right um

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,920
but even if it's a large exchange like

00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,880
it's generally like in one

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,960
or two locations um that you have to

00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,040
like make these changes

00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,480
um so yeah this is a great pro request

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,359
that's done by like an external

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,920
contributor

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,400
um and we still have to review it of

00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,240
course

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,799
but like overall it looks pretty good

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,799
awesome yeah so i appreciate you walking

00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:46,319
through that too as well that said uh

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,119
yeah be helpful for a lot of people to

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,799
see not only did we walk into this and

00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,079
like see how packages work and see how

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,640
the testing works too as well because

00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,799
that's

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,079
a lot of times like i can open up a pr

00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,799
but i have no idea how to get the test

00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,880
to run

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,079
um so like knowing where the tests live

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,200
and sort of like some of the hoops you

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,240
have to jump through that's super

00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,640
helpful

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,160
um we're at pretty close to top of the

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,760
hour so i did want to

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,359
leave some room for questions like do

00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,280
you have a hard stop in the next few

00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:14,480
minutes

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,200
no i'm uh i don't have uh like anything

00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,440
else after this

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,559
okay should be fine cool so yeah maybe

00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,160
we don't have to rush

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,480
uh through the questions but if anybody

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,480
has any questions about next um

00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,520
please leave them in there in the chat

00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,079
too on twitch

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,359
and we'll address them in a moment but

00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,040
while we're waiting for

00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,400
those questions to come through i'm

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,000
gonna actually

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,000
actually i'll keep the screen share

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,599
going uh because i wanted to

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,240
i mentioned i wanted to do this little

00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,960
exercise there's a um

00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,400
do with the github.com stars you can

00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,119
actually see the last star that you've

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,839
starred

00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,480
as far as repo goes and uh so these are

00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,599
my stars uh you can see i've done 551

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,839
stars

00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,440
i used to start projects for saving for

00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,480
later back in the day

00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,720
and then it got to the point where i

00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,440
just was starring too much stuff that i

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,240
could not

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,160
sort of uh uh figure out what happened

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,480
or what i started before

00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,480
and then i discovered github.com and i'm

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,760
like oh excellent now i can see like i'm

00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,280
a big fan of javascript

00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,160
projects apparently and uh i tend to my

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,079
my pattern is i

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,599
actually whatever i'm working on if this

00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,559
solves my problem so i was working on a

00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:23,040
chat bot for

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:25,119
twitch um i am uh

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,640
i'm sticking to get stalker yeah that's

00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:28,480
uh the last thing i start

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,000
um but yeah i've been trying to work on

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,079
a chat bot so i looked at a bunch of

00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,440
twitch apis and sdks

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,280
and i've been starring that i've also

00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,520
been following a bunch of uh twitch

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,680
streamers so i've started a

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,559
their chat bot as well which got me down

00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,480
this uh

00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,319
this rabbit hole but i did want to talk

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,520
really quick about get stalker

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,720
uh which is this here um git stalker is

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,920
a little command line tool

00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,960
um which is uh it's it's a lot of fun

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,799
and it's uh

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,079
it could oh yeah i should definitely

00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,240
look at the uh

00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,440
the ascii art that's there too as well

00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,720
uh but yeah it's a

00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,640
it's i think the project's less than

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,359
like a week old as well so it's

01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,400
only got six stars so everybody um who

01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,599
stars projects

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,480
please oh don't use get stalker on me

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,440
um please uh do that uh so i actually

01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,319
distaled uh

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,119
you uh tim and i could see that you have

01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,119
uh

01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,559
well this is your bio co-author of

01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,559
next.js and mdx and

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,760
probably this actually pop that out in

01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,799
the beginning and we could

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,400
uh uh everybody see the intro but um

01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,720
yeah and it's it's cool to see like you

01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,559
have 204 repos uh

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,640
it actually tells you the languages that

01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,040
you're um i guess you've sort of touched

01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,240
or is

01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,680
yeah so yeah and then also we can see uh

01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,200
that you've closed a bunch of issues too

01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,240
as well so if i want to

01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,559
yeah um sorry what was a command

01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,359
i'm gonna stalk myself because i didn't

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:53,119
actually do this on myself

01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,760
so i'm talking myself um yeah so this is

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,000
my

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,440
bio host of mutual fund live yeah that's

01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,200
come directly from github

01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,760
oh i didn't actually see when you joined

01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,839
either but uh 2013 of october

01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,440
that's when i created my github account

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,799
no i'm not looking for a job

01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,440
yeah i thought that was really really

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:11,280
neat so if anybody uh

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,960
um if anybody is interested in checking

01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,359
that out i'm curious also

01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,160
um if you have i guess what was the last

01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,160
project you starred

01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,960
so i actually had a bunch but

01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,400
uh i don't start that often so like if

01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,160
if i'm starting something it's something

01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,599
really good oh in general um

01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,920
man i hope that one day get a star for

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,920
you know

01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,520
um so like the last thing i started that

01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,720
wasn't something that we built ourselves

01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:43,920
um was denno

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,559
the new javascript runtime typescript

01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,079
runtime

01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:53,440
how do you how do you spell that uh

01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:57,119
so d-e-n-o do you know

01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,280
yeah you know yeah we'll see if it pops

01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,480
up

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:06,000
is it this yeah that's it

01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:09,440
okay very cool yeah so this is basically

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,640
um something that

01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,760
uh replaces note as the runtime for

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,680
javascript

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,960
um as building rest and it looks

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,160
it's super interesting um and it's still

01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,480
very much in development

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,680
but they're working on it pretty heavily

01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,359
so

01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,359
i'm super curious where it will go

01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:36,880
and then something else that i had was

01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,839
wallace cli um i'll probably send it to

01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,839
you in a chat because

01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:48,960
otherwise it's hard to get that over

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,160
because it's very long night

01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,119
yeah and while you do that i'll figure

01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,119
out how to open up the chat

01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:59,839
there we go yeah

01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,079
so this is a um

01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,480
tool to basically analyze the css on

01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,760
your website

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,359
so if you um

01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,720
basically if you scroll up you can go to

01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,599
the website that's like probably a

01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,400
better

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,400
way to show it

01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,280
sorry say that one more uh time you just

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,440
cut out

01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,799
okay so if you scroll up to the the

01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,440
website that's linked

01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,880
yeah and go into the website it's

01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,079
probably a better way to show it

01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,720
because you can also keep track of other

01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,400
websites

01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,760
i think um

01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,599
you should probably go to the homepage

01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,960
of the website actually uh

01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:48,000
is oh okay gotcha yeah so

01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,000
can you click a live demo

01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,520
live demo that always gives me uh yeah

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,039
yeah for sure yeah

01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:58,799
so what this does is it basically

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,599
analyzes your css

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,400
so if you give it a website um you can

01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,240
basically see

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,559
like how many selectors you have

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,880
properties like all that

01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:12,079
and how many lines of code you have

01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,599
where do you add the website

01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,200
i think you have to log in actually

01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,799
that's why i was uh

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,039
or maybe you have to go to the home page

01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:21,760
and then like say get started but

01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,799
i got you i'm not exactly sure okay yeah

01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,720
oh you have to create an account i'll

01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,000
create account some other time

01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,480
but uh yeah i definitely want to check

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,599
that out because uh yeah my css i use uh

01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,440
style components on

01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,960
my main project that i've my set side

01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,480
project yeah um

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,640
but i'd be curious how it's it's

01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,280
analyzed um mainly because i've

01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,000
i've been aggressively deleting my

01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,200
index.css as i move

01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,200
stuff to style components but also

01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,599
because i know i'm bad at css

01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,880
and i do a lot of bad like i do a lot of

01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,240
like not great things

01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,599
in css so to keep myself good and honest

01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,319
and i can also have people contribute

01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,480
with me

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,359
i try to like try to keep best practices

01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,200
but i

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,799
will definitely check out uh project

01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:04,079
wallace for sure

01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,760
yeah that one more thing that is uh

01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,119
something that we built but someone on

01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:12,319
my team built it's a git of action to

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,680
keep track of size increases of

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:19,039
javascript uh of next itself um

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:23,119
so if you go to pro request

01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:24,799
in next js yeah yeah

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,559
but it's open source so like i sent you

01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:30,160
the link in the chat already but

01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:32,480
yeah if you go to um

01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,839
like let's first go into the proquest so

01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,359
like click on

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:39,680
pretty much any pro request you want

01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,760
sorry i just clicked the link in the uh

01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
yeah

01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,200
so yeah so if you take this one for

01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,039
example um

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,960
even though this doesn't change next

01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,559
itself but you see those stats from

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,160
current pr yeah

01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,599
that's a github action that basically

01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,720
like uh

01:05:53,599 --> 01:06:00,559
clones your request

01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:04,400
and the nexus canary slash master wrench

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,319
and it will basically like try to

01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,599
figure out like what the size difference

01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,079
is in what you

01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,640
like made in changes so like say you

01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,559
make a change in the nexus compiler

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,880
yeah we actually know if it's going to

01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,240
help in bundle size or will increase

01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,640
bundle size

01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,640
same if you include a like massive

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,280
library for example will know if you're

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,440
like increasing the module size of the

01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,559
next project

01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,559
in a way that is like too much basically

01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,680
so it shows you a lot of like other

01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,319
stuff

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,079
uh the reason that you see uh jj's

01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,799
handle there is that he uses his own

01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,319
like

01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,480
token yeah to send those um

01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,160
which is funny because we have like in

01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,559
the repo we have two

01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,160
bots and they're both people from my

01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,359
team that are like they've bought a

01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,559
fight themselves

01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:57,280
yeah um yeah i've seen that happen

01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,079
and a job um so you never know if you're

01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,280
talking to your

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,960
to the real person

01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:07,520
yeah so like overall um

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,240
like these comments are uh basically to

01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,319
help like

01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,440
one thing that we noticed was we had

01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:13,520
users that

01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,599
broke the tests but couldn't figure out

01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,680
where they broke the test

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,960
so like the first thing that we did was

01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,280
we introduced this stat

01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,480
action to basically show you like hey

01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,720
you're increasing the

01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,920
the size of the next chess project and

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,960
we don't want that

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,559
yeah because we want to consistently

01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,760
like either have the same consistent

01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,799
size

01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,000
or reduce the size right of like your

01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,119
browser bundles

01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,119
um so this helps a lot with optimizing

01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,400
but then we also introduced a separate

01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,319
git of action

01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:49,119
that publishes the filled test result

01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:50,079
into your pull request so anytime a test

01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,599
fails

01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,680
we basically send this message being

01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,400
like hey you

01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,000
broke this test uh can you fix it or

01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,920
well not even can you fix it but like

01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,920
this is the test that broke

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,640
and here you can see like what broke

01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,640
specifically

01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,280
so we have a lot of like other stuff to

01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,079
help new contributors

01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,400
um be as productive as they can be

01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,599
because

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,440
like otherwise you have to like go

01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,600
through all these logs like going to get

01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,960
actions that kind of thing which is

01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,440
really hard to

01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,159
get right basically like if you're if

01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,920
you've never been

01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:25,839
inside of this project you you just

01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,319
don't know where to go if like something

01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:30,319
fails

01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:32,880
right yeah yeah it's super helpful

01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,679
and um yeah shout out to github actions

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,279
for

01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:39,359
um it looks like the net stack uh sorry

01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,560
next stats action that's a tongue

01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:44,719

01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:51,520
those uh

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,000
i'm pretty sure somebody will drop them

01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,799
in the chat

01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,159
if someone didn't get those uh links if

01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,920
not the the video will be up

01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:59,759
it should render shortly after we hit

01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,400
stop but i did want to transition to the

01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,600
questions

01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:07,040
in the uh the chat as well

01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,480
um so let me just get uh

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,359
real quick i'm gonna fix the window

01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,000
because it's a

01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,000
bit broken

01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,239
excellent sorry i had it all set up and

01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,120
then i

01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,120
i fumbled it

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
okay that should be good all right yeah

01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,839
so just looking at the chat uh i think

01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,199
we had one question come through

01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:37,279
um which was uh i'm

01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:38,080
parapus parapass i'm parapass that's who

01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,480
you are

01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,359
and um yeah the one question was like

01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,640
how many issues

01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,520
does uh is made on next js repo uh per

01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,560
day

01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,679
which is a good question

01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,600
i don't know it's a lot

01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,600
i i think that's like

01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:00,400
i don't know actually yeah at the moment

01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:03,600
there's pills or something yeah

01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:08,080
at the moment there's 428 so

01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,560
i i think actually on the insides tab

01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,199
so if you win the repo and then insights

01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,199
yeah i

01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:18,960
i was just looking at that um it's like

01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:22,520
the last week 33 issues

01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,840
but the last month

01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:30,000
121 and 185

01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:32,080
closed so slowly going down

01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,920
yeah yeah this is actually available to

01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,840
anybody who wants to sort of uh

01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,440
check out and get that answer to that

01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,120
question um

01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,880
yeah yeah definitely check out the next

01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,840
repo actually any repo and let's check

01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,760
out the uh

01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,360
up on the insights tab and then you

01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,320
you've got exactly what you're looking

01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,199
for

01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:51,040
um yeah cool and then uh yeah i'm just

01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:53,199
gonna look at the chat a little more

01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,480
um yeah thanks for starting the the next

01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,560
js repo too

01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,320
uh i'm a big fan of people starring

01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,880
repos um

01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,480
and mainly it's a it is a vanity metric

01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,280
but it's also a good signal for

01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,840
for maintainers and contributors to know

01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,440
um

01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,960
if people are using their project and

01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,320
sort of the engagement

01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,679
um i think a lot of people uh it's easy

01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,480
for people to get burnt out at open

01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,880
source

01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,880
so if they don't have that signal or

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,320
have the sort of interactions then it

01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,679
could sort of fall off so

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,480
i'm curious my question to you is how do

01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,080
you sort of not burn out on the uh

01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,760
the hundred prs that you're you need to

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,000
look at after this call

01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,000
or the 50 50 issues that you get this

01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
week like what's how do you sort of pace

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,920
yourself um

01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,840
because i know it's your full-time job

01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,000
but it also could be overwhelming yeah

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,040
being maintainer community manager like

01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,480
i don't know to someone who's actually

01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,880
managed the community but

01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,560
you are in the the issues so you you are

01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,120
wearing this sort of hat of community

01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,159
and

01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:51,520
project manager and stuff like that

01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:53,440
yeah so um

01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,560
so personally i just really enjoy

01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,159
brookfield next

01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:01,280
uh like work on open source um

01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:04,480
it's sometimes like

01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,560
i just try to focus on like other things

01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,600
like that's why i like sometimes i i let

01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,920
the

01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,360
like issues or pull requests or whatever

01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,760
like go up a bit

01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,719
um because then you can go through them

01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,600
like one by one

01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,520
like in a day or something um like right

01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,560
now with like 90 open view requests you

01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,320
have to like spend

01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:26,239
multiple days to go through them um

01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,920
but they also know that like most of the

01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:30,080
pro requests are not like

01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,440
pressing as in like oh they need to be

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,760
shipped tomorrow right

01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,679
um they're mostly like updates to

01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,960
examples updates the documentation that

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,640
kind of thing

01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,840
um and the like downside of that is also

01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,520
that some of these

01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,040
like changes to the core for example

01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,800
have to be discussed like very

01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:50,080
extensively also

01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,120
um so it's obviously a lot of work

01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,440
um for me personally

01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,840
i just try to go through them as fast as

01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,080
possible

01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,520
but that's really hard to do if you have

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,840
like a lot of

01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,679
notifications and a lot of requests

01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,199
so i don't have a good answer to like

01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,320
how do you not burn out

01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:15,040
um because

01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,440
like i was also like before i joined for

01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,080
sale

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,000
i i was just like contributing to the

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,560
next probably like 40 hours per week

01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,400
next to my 40-hour like job or whatever

01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,840
um

01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,199
but i just found it really interesting

01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,880
and i was learning new things all the

01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,320
time so it was like

01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,000
it wasn't like oh i have to do this it

01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,600
wasn't a burden to do it right

01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,040
it was more like oh i find this really

01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,440
interesting i like doing it

01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,080
um i'm learning a lot and that's why i'm

01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,800
doing it

01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,159
um and it's not because like some random

01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,480
person like on the other side of the

01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:47,280
world wants me to like

01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,560
fix all these issues or something right

01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,159
um

01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,920
today it's obviously different because

01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,440
now we're like building the project

01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:58,080
the product slash project uh out

01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,800
um and like tons and tons of tons of

01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,760
more users come by

01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,440
and we try to like help everyone right

01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,000
sometimes that's possible sometimes it's

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:10,000
not

01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,040
um but overall it's just like

01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
yeah i would probably say like try to do

01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,480
the thing that you

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,440
enjoy doing or something which sounds

01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,440
super cheesy but

01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,400
yeah that's i mean that's a a good thing

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,600
to mention too as well like if you

01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,120
aren't enjoying it

01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,640
perhaps find something else that you are

01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,640
enjoying like i know

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,000
frameworks come and go libraries come

01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,400
and go like people

01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,280
moving waves like i mean i used to have

01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,520
a different haircut

01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,719
five years ago so like we we change we

01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,239
change our style and like the things

01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,679
that we're interested in and like

01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,360
there's no reason that

01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,880
maybe if you aren't into react today and

01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,480
like you want to try something new like

01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,280
a felt or a view like

01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,159
there's nothing against doing that um

01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,600
but

01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,880
there's always opportunity for anybody

01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,719
who wants to sort of contribute so like

01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,920
shout out to stewie who found this uh

01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,239
stream super

01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,239
helpful uh he mentioned that he's gonna

01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,440
uh i guess peruse to the examples

01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:05,600
tomorrow and see if there's any sort of

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,480
help that he can also give too so you'll

01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,960
have uh

01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,000
you have your 101st uh pr this week to

01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,440
look at

01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:17,280
hopefully but um so uh yeah

01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,760
we're working on a um a ui for examples

01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,760
also

01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,520
on the website so like that you can

01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,960
basically like see all the examples

01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,280
instead of that they're like hidden

01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,480
behind this like one click inside of

01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,920
together prefer that you don't know

01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,199
about for example

01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,199
so that will probably also help

01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,880
awesome and then also shout out to

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,520
everybody shouting out github actions

01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,400
too as well

01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,760
uh as like a nice little tool um yeah i

01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,280
appreciate you showing off your

01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,920
your action that you all are using on

01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,159
the on the the project

01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,040
and um yeah if anybody else doesn't have

01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,560
any questions

01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,560
i guess my only question is sort of how

01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,440
do people sort of connect with you

01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,440
um actually we didn't even cover that um

01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,800
zeit or do they have like a community

01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,800
like secretary's channel i know we have

01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,080
discussions uh which is a good place to

01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,679
get questions answered

01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,199
yeah but as far as like meeting the rest

01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,000
of the community is there another uh

01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,800
channel for people to figure that out

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,199
so currently we we only use discussions

01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,920
like mostly for this type of stuff

01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,440
um so we have a bunch of discussions

01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,239
it's still like very much work in

01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,560
progress

01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:22,800
um but we're getting there uh we used to

01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,970
use spectrum but we moved to get a

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,120
good discussions for this um and

01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:29,360
[Music]

01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,159
yeah if you want to reach out i'm on

01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,520
twitter

01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:35,440
um quite heavily

01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,800
so you can always like reach out there

01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,840
uh that's what you did also

01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,480
to reach out for uh this talk that we

01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,320
just had

01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:46,480
um yeah it's um

01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,600
it's generally where where i can be fine

01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,159
uh can be found

01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,000
like for dms or whatever yeah and

01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:53,120
stewie's actually mentioned that he um

01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,040
so i'm just looking at the twitch chat

01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,320
for anybody who needs contacts but he's

01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,600
mentioning that he um

01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,840
used an xjs uh hashtag on twitter

01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,280
uh and got an answer yeah to a question

01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,239
as well so it seems like

01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,920
at least you're following that hashtag

01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:12,000
yeah

01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:15,040
yeah i i have custom filters for that um

01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,239
yeah are you a tweetdeck fan

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,600
yeah so i use tweetdeck for uh yeah for

01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,880
the extensive twitter

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,679
uh like uh looking into all the twitter

01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,800
streams but

01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:29,920
um i also just have a like search

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,600
inside of the twitter app on my iphone

01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,040
um

01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,800
and it works pretty well too like it

01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,679
works in the same way as sweet deck only

01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,840
on your phone

01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:43,120
um and yeah what else do i use

01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,040
i i mostly use tweetdeck for

01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,640
like just scrolling through all the

01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:49,360

01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,360
uh topics

01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,000
awesome well um i think we're good on

01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,400
questions

01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,760
uh if anybody else doesn't have any um i

01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,960

01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,080
um we will be doing more of these in the

01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,679
future

01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,120
uh just definitely follow github on

01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,480
twitter follow the if you haven't hit

01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,360
the follow button for

01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,080
the github twitch also hit that as well

01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,239
um

01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,320
because uh we will try to get a good

01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:16,000
stream of announcements this was

01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,520
not so much a test like i sort of knew

01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,040
what we were going to do um

01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,960
and like we knew we had a plan for this

01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,800
but sort of trying to figure out um

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,880
sort of streaming here um so i'm super

01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,400
happy that a bunch of you showed up

01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,320
i also want to give a shout out too as

01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,280
well um for those

01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,239
who aren't aware uh github satellite is

01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,840
going to be next week

01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:37,600
so which is also why uh potentially

01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,880
i have a stream book but uh i'm not

01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,800
confident that we actually

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,159
will do that because satellite's going

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,440
to be a super busy week

01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,840
uh but get up satellite is going to be

01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,840
at online 100 online conference

01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,360
normally it's hosted or would have been

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,800
hosted in paris but norm was hosted

01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,280

01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,040
github discussions which got a lot of

01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,960
