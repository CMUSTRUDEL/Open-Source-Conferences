but uh folks this is open source friday

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
this is a time for us to talk to open

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,080
source maintainers about things they're

excited about

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
uh and today we're gonna talk about home

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
assistant the open source automation

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,679
tool open sourced uh i said open source

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
twice

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,119
um but real quick some housekeeping um

today and said how you got here sure

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
right so my name is paul strauss i'm a

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,680
dutch software engineer

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
i no longer live in the netherlands i

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,799
nowadays live in california

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
and around like seven and a half maybe

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,600
eight years

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
ago already i started home assistant and

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
home assistant is an open source home

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
automation

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
platform that you can run at home on

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
like a raspberry pi

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
um and it puts like local control and

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
privacy first so

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
you know i actually i started it because

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
i got the philips hue lights when they

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
got released

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,479
and you know i was like it has an api

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,880
and i want to control this

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
and then after i was like i got control

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,360
i was like

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
well then i now i need to do something

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,880
with it right so i

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,799
had the lights turned on when the sun

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
was setting and then

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,640
you know the lights turned on when i was

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
not at home so i needed to have presence

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
detection and kind of like the ball went

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,799
rolling and rolling and

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,840
well now we're here and we're like

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,240
40 000 get up stars i think last year

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
we were the second most active

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
contributed

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
project to python project 2 on github um

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,320
wow so yeah with more than like

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,600
uh 2 000 people was it it i don't

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,920
remember actually the numbers or eight

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
times

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
i think it was 8 000 different people

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
that interacted with our repository

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
last year yeah and this is uh before

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,640
like

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
the device that sort of kind of brought

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
everything into everybody's home it

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,319
seems like the amazon echo device

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,840
this is right this is pre amazon.com yes

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,200
yes it's before and it's kind of

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
annoying because

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
now the amazon and the google devices

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
which i will not name them because they

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
will

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
activate but yeah they actually are

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,440
referred to as like

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
home assistants or like smart home

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,000
assistants and so i get like

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,920
so many things like hashtag homosystem

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
is being used in like the wrong context

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
and

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
i mean it's obviously also my fault for

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
picking a

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,800
rather generic name but it is what it is

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,920
now right we're here

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,920
so yeah so you just had you wanted to

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,360
control your smart lights so you you

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
build this thing and python it sounds

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
like

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
yeah and it's now grown the 40 000 plus

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
stars on github

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
right tons of contributors and before we

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
got on stream you mentioned you have

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
you have so many contributors like

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,000
almost too many uh which is a nice nice

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
thing to have

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
yes yeah so the back end is python it's

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
a python application that runs with like

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,599
async io

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
and the front end is all javascript so

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,560
we use web components for this

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
and it's a progressive web application

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
so people can actually

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,680
you know you host it at home and then

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,280
from your home you access it so you can

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
either open ports on your router or you

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,599
can use like forwarding services like

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
home assistant cloud and then you open

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,959
this progressive web app you can

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
actually with chrome on android or

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,560
on ios you can actually add it to your

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,480
home screen and you have like even push

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,480
notifications through this

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,840
um but we also realized actually

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,239
progressive web apps was not

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
enough so we also have simple wrappers

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,120
for ios and

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,799
android so we can send you a location

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
back for example right so it's be cool

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,599
you

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
go out and about you can send your

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,120
location back use geofencing for your

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,760
automations and stuff like that

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
so yeah both javascript and python yeah

00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
yeah and uh

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,680
there's already questions in the chat

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,720
too michael banvard who's here

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
um asking about the pi zero uh w

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,760
specifically will holmen's system work

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,799
for that i guess is that one of the

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,200
brand new one that came out

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
no so the pi zero is actually a

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,640
rebranded

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
raspberry pi one but then in a smaller

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
form factor

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,959
with less ports and it is really really

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,919
really slow

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
so please please don't right like we

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,880
also see it like it's not being really

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,880
used anymore when i

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
really look at our download statistics

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
it's really like raspberry pi

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
3 or higher it's recommended and that's

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
actually because

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,919
homeless systems has kind of outgrown

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
itself so

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
we started out as a python application

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,919
we realized that

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479
you know when we see people struggle is

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,400
just to

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,240
install a python virtual environment

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
install a python package

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,919
that's step one right then installing

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
this one then maintaining it like

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,400
we bump python dependencies we don't

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
bite and we bump by the versions

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
and so we you know when docker came

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,120
around we're like this is great we need

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
to get everybody on docker but you can

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
just like get everybody on docker too

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
so we actually built our own operating

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
system so we have our own operating

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
system so you actually

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
you take a raspberry pi or you launched

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
in a virtual machine as well

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,440
it has an operating system which runs

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
home assistant in the container

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
and you actually update and run home

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
assistant

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,560
like through the ui there's no longer

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,560
any command line tool necessary

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,080
to be up and running and like updating

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
it so it's you know like a

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
normal home automation hub you would get

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
of the shelf or any like internet

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
connected device

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,639
and then this is great because we can

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,320
help you keep it secure

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,160
right you can you don't have to deal

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
with python updates and like i mean

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
it's python is a great language but

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,639
dependency management in any language is

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,960
just

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,720
hell yeah and do you get a lot of folks

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,199
who are just sort of tinkerers or maybe

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,639
can

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,280
you know copy some scripts here and

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
there not full-on developers who want to

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,199
do home assistant as well

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
i mean we have the whole range i think

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,240
in the beginning we were very technical

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
focused it was a lot of like

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,919
configuration text files and so and

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,520
because it was difficult to install i

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,440
think we attracted more like people that

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
were also system administrators

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,199
right they have those skills and

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
nowadays we get like a whole wide range

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
so there's like

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,919
you know there's stories of people using

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
it the museum there's people using it in

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,120
factories but also people at home

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
thinkers like schools

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
uh everybody that can get their hands on

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,160
a raspberry pi can pretty much

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
get started with home assistant and it's

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
it's really cool because it's you don't

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
need much right even if you

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
like most people will have a device that

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,479
is smart nowadays even if they don't

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,560
realize like if you have a chromecast or

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,199
a google home mini right those are

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,000
already

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
things that we can read out but also

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
like

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
uh we like the recent gs is this new

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
chip

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,440
it's called the esp8266 like i know you

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,360
can see this

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
but yeah like this this device it's like

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,960
two three dollars

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,319
and it includes wi-fi and so you can

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
program these and you can put these

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
nodes

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,840
throughout your house and then send

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,080
sensor data in or just like have

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,919
leds come on and really like tinker on

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,919
the like electronic site and

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
we see that's also been getting a lot of

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,960
popularity recently

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,319
yeah i mean it's as a recent like i i

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,000
love that we're doing this on twitch and

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
i mentioned this too as well uh before

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
we hit live

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,560
like there's a lot of folks who are now

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,680
at home who have a lot more time like i

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,039
used to travel

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
like every other week i'd be somewhere

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
else i was in europe like four times

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
last year

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,360
like i never had time to go to sit and

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,280
think about oh

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
how am i gonna route this system and

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,520
like i i always lean for the amazon

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,319
echoes and the the google devices

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,240
because

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
out of the box it is kind of this work

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,360
sort of right um

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,039
but i'm actually super excited to see it

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
about like what you're gonna share

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,720
in like the the progressive web app but

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,879
also the sort of routing and

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
all the devices that you you have i

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,039
guess from your arms reach that you're

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,940
you're pulling up

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,560
right i got everything ready here

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,680
[Laughter]

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
actually like like always be uh always

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,879
be ready

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
to share your project right no but yeah

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
i mean i can show some i definitely

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,000
prepared some demos i think the one

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,520
thing i really want to show is that like

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
how easy it is i think a lot of people

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,599
when they think of open source they

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
think

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,639
it's difficult to get started or they

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
haven't thought about that

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
or like it's only really for the geeks

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,720
because it's open source you have to

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
github

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
install like clone it and stuff and

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,919
that's not the case we actually have

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,639
been putting so much effort in making it

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
easy

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
because we want more people to reach it

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,759
right we don't want to have

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
these 8 000 people that have worked on

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
the core of like interacted with us in

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
the last year

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
just for this small niche no we want to

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,560
you know everybody be able to get this

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
in the house if they want to yeah and it

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
sounds like uh decipher

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
mentioned that he um he's been loving

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,360
this and he's actually he's just

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,080
shouting out and saying thanks for your

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
work paulus

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,519
uh and then bruh 5200. these names are

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,959
uh amazing but uh

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,880
he's saying that he discovered a year or

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,360
two ago and uh it's like it's a huge

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,880
part of his life as well

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
yeah well i think i mean like you just

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
mentioned the pandemic like there's so

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
many stories of people using home

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,120
assistant to

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
tell their kids when the homeschooling

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
starts so like they'll have a light turn

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,959
on

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
so the kids know oh i have to go

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,720
downstairs to my homeschool

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
area or something and the screens will

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
start up and these kind of things

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,080
yeah yeah and uh there's one other

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,080
question in the chat about um

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
like why would you choose to run home

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
assistant uh

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,160
is it really i guess their question is

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
really is it really focused on if you

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
have multiple devices that you're trying

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
to

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
automate together and like sort of sync

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,399
it it's really whatever you want with it

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,240
i think i think that's like if you the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,000
die hard home automation that like want

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
to automate everything and never see an

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
interface

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
yeah that's possible if you wanna like

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
configure

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,760
ui uh and like have the dashboard as

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,120
cool as possible

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
that's possible if you want to write

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,920
javascript to like make cool graphs or

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,800
do cool interactions floor plans

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
that is possible i mean it really goes

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,160
all directions and i think

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
i mean the electronics people love it

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
because with

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,720
very little effort they have a ui for

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
the electronics project

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
right it's one thing to build some

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
electronics but then to have a ui read

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
it out control it

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,279
all that stuff is now just possible so

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
yeah yeah it goes all over the place i

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,800
mean i

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,440
so i just show like yeah like let's uh

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
go ahead and

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
switch over to screen sharing right so

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
yeah

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,480
can you switch to the camera real quick

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,360
so i'm gonna

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,839
i'm gonna use this device ah oh

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,839
it's falling

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,279
hopefully it's still good i'm gonna so

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,200
we we recently

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,279
uh released like a case for the odroid

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
m2 so the odroid m2 is like a raspberry

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,959
pi but so we build a case

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,839
so but i'm going to use this device to

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,800
do like the the onboarding so i just

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,480
plugged it in this morning so yeah let's

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,839
switch over

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,880
so once you plug it in right so i'm

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,000
gonna

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,519
go to the url so this is it

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
right so we're seeing onboarding so i'm

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
gonna type in my name

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
i'm gonna type in a password that's not

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
very secure

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,880
now it will tell me what is my name i'll

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,600
call it home demo

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
um so to get like the location or i'll

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,079
just do

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
detect well it says hey you're at the

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,240
university of california irvine

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,560
that is correct although i'm in america

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,640
i do very much like my metric system

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,519
uh i i won't judge you

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
all right and so this is already um you

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,399
know

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,000
during onboarding we have already seen

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,640
home assistant has already found

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,560
five different devices on my network so

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,800
just found a belkan wemo

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
you want to set it up yes so now

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,120
development questions

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,560
did you have to do any setup to make it

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
discoverable in your network or is this

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,240
we have three different ways of

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,600
detecting it so we use like

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,920
xeroconf or bonjour or mdns it's one of

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
the

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,079
uh protocols we use we use universal

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,480
plug and play

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,720
and then recently we are also listening

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,720
to dhcp requests

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
so for example uh we had some because we

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
couldn't detect teslas

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
right and we were like how can we detect

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,560
teslas and so actually when a tesla

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,720
comes home

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
it will connect to your wi-fi and it

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,959
will do so with the mac address and um

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,120
host name that we can route back oh

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,839
that's a tesla so now we know

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
oh that's a tesla so for example now

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,639
there's wemo i'm like like well where is

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,160
it

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,399
um i'll do bedroom and then for example

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
you know i on the stream i use like uh

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,480
elgato key light to light myself

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,800
you want to set it up yes um

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,920
google cast i also like to set up my

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,240
google cast that's like

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
chromecast home assistant sorry google

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,399
home hubs

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,160
these kind of things um solos are not

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
set up right now so i don't know what my

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,519
kids are playing upstairs

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,000
this um this orange house you might

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
recognize this this is the homekit logo

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
okay so home assistant speaks the

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
homekit protocol

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,120
and so normally speaking the homework

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
skip

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,920
as a controller so normally devices only

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
speak homekit to be controlled

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,079
and only ios devices like ipads iphones

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
and macbooks

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,079
are allowed to control over homekit but

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,000
home assistant can do this too

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,639
and this means that this this is my

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,800
thermostat a lyric thermostat

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,680
and home assistant can talk to it

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
locally

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,200
through homekit without requiring any

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
apple device

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,040
so this way we can control your

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880
thermostat locally and because

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,240
the homekit protocol is actually pretty

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,279
cool because it's local

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
it is it has great discovery it works

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
pretty well

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,519
but apple has it locked down with

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
licenses

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,199
so we're open source so we uh

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
you know we kind of navigate differently

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,839
and uh

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
so we have implemented this and this is

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,079
an option and so you can actually

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,920
control

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
lyric through this so sometimes you have

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,440
the option go through homekit

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,720
or go through the cloud well then of

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,480
course we prefer local

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
so yeah this is the third and final step

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
of onboarding so now i'm going to click

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
finish

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
and now as you can see i'm going to stay

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,560
am i logged in yes

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,000
so now i'm already uh this is my

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,680
uh the dashboard of my house and so

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
for example i mean this is just you know

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
i this is just in five minutes right i

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,320
didn't do anything special

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,519
and so for example this wemo switch i

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
actually connected it to the light

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
behind me

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
right so all of a sudden during like

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,399
these five minutes

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,839
now so i can already connect control

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,920
things on my stream i can do the same

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,000
thing with the i'll get the key light

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,160
as you can see the this is of course

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,279
what's limiting me right so yeah

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
um yeah and so you can also also see

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
that i have like two google homes

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,600
one is a google home hub i actually got

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,880
it here for another demo in a bit

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,519
um yeah this is amazing and uh

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,639
uh you just real quick you went from the

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,880
home assistant uh

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,320
documentation that's where you what was

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,120
the link you clicked to sort of step

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
into this

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,480
so i went to homeassistant.local.com8123

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,079
so that's the default website where it

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
becomes available when it starts up in

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
your network

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
okay so once because there's a two step

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
right first you have to get a device

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
that runs home

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,240
assistant so a raspberry pi or like a

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,839
old droid m2

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,839
or home assistant blue and then when you

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
plug those in like once the image is

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
flashed then you just plug them into the

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,320
network it will automatically download

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,880
the latest home assistant

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
start up discover your devices and you

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,399
go through onboarding and just kind of

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
go with the flow from there

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,440
okay that's amazing and there are some a

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,360
lot of questions coming through

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,199
yeah so the one there's one request

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
around configuration through yaml files

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,320
uh if that was a possibility uh yeah so

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
there is

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,079
there is possibility to configure

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
certain things through yaml files

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,600
um but not everything so a lot of these

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,680
authentication things with

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,399
you know we we discover a lot of things

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,560
and those things are

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,480
running on ip addresses but ip addresses

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
can change and these kind of things so a

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,120
lot of

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,399
device configuration is no longer in

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
yemo and

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,680
it's actually funny you mentioned this

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,199
because this is just a it's been a

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
pretty long discussion inside the home

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
assistant community

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,320
that somebody is bringing up now because

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,480
actually last year we made the decision

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,160
we're moving away from yamo for device

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,399
configuration and we

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,480
only allow yaml for animations and

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,279
scripts scenes

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,040
things that or that or integrations that

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,240
in which you define a protocol yourself

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
like mqtt

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
for example yeah but i mean now i'm

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
getting really technical really quick

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,759
yeah yeah yeah we don't have to get that

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,560
deep there are some questions around the

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,639
cloud though uh or what's the benefit of

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,800
local versus cloud and i guess question

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,160
mark remote access

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,920
so yeah locals faster right if you have

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,079
a computer at your home that talks

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,560
locally to the switch that next to it

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,920
it's going to be fast yep if your

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
internet is down

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,240
and your wi-fi is still up it still

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,160
works um and you're not sharing your

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
data with anyone right nobody has to

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
know that you turned on your light

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
because

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
if you think about home automation

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,520
devices they really tell a personal

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,280
story about your life

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
what music are you listening to what

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
lights are on what rooms are you using

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,400
what's the

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,079
temperature you like this just there's a

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,520
lot of stuff that can be derived from

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
what you're doing and

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,280
that's not something you always just

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,520
want to share with everybody

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,319
yeah that's a it's a concern that like i

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,480
have one of those

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,160
amazon device behind me and uh it's

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,600
muted at the moment right

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
and uh because i don't really have any

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
use for it other than turning on lights

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
it sounds like i don't have any more use

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,200
for it because i might just switch over

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
to

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,120
this yeah i mean i i would switch over

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
yeah

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,360
for sure yeah i will definitely be uh

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
setting this up later

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,440
yeah yeah so i mean i have some more

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,280
demos so one of the other things that

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
i just talked about like electronics

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
right that i already showed this board

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,799
just now and this is actually like a

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,520
prototype of something that we built out

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
like a bit more

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
further but this is the esp8266 so it's

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
like a

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,280
it has wi-fi and it can run like code

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
and this is a nfc

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
tag reader so that way you can scan

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,799
cards

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
and then have it do stuff in your house

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,520
and i actually had to set up in my house

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,039
i printed these cards for my kids these

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,200
are all songs

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,799
in either danish or dutch so this is

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,600
like the wheels on the bus

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,520
and this is like clapping your hands and

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,720
so each card is a song and

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
my son when he was one year old he could

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
like

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,480
use these cards and he knew that he

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,919
could put him on the tech reader and

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
would start playing his song on the

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
sonos

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,160
oh nice and then of course later he got

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,720
into like

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,080
service vehicles so i also have like you

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,640
know the sounds of like

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
ambulances and fire trucks these

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
actually i mean

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,559
these are the dutch fire trucking

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
ambulance because i'm of course i want

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,760
him to

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
know his culture so he has to learn the

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,799
the dutch fire trucks

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,280
sounds um

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
but yeah so we actually we made this uh

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,919
this this

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,840
code on this board is powered by like

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
esp home which is like another open

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,760
source project

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
with yaml files you kind of say i use

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,039
this

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,360
microcontroller and on this pins i have

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
this

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,880
a led or a buzzer or stuff and then just

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,880
say flash and it just works so

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
we then create like with 3d printing

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,600
some cases around it so this is for

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
example

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,679
attack reader and it's like final form

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,080
and actually if you open it up

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
ah you can see it's just the stuff that

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,440
i just showed you

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,520
just a little bit more tight together

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,160
right this and this is also stuff that

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,160
we are

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
uh you know it's all open source it's

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
all like you can download it in github

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
but what i want to show now is let me

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
open um i'm going to the integrations

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,200
panel

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,760
so this is sonos i'm going to ignore so

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,240
now so i'm going to ignore the lyric

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
so what i want to show you is that we've

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,400
onboarding is really important for us so

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,640
for us

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,720
if you plug this in it needs to work

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,919
right away so this one i've already

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,520
set up before uh to connect to the wi-fi

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,400
just because it makes it a little easier

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
for the demo

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,840
so i'm gonna plug it in now and then i'm

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,559
hoping it's gonna show up on my screen

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,960
awkward

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,960
let's see

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
now

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,520
okay only a couple of hundred of us are

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,120
are watching you try to oh that's good

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,840
i think when i opened it i moved it

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
around or something

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,360
no worries uh and thanks uh the wendev

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
who's answering a lot of questions you

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
got a lot of fans in the uh the chat at

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
the moment

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,440
answering questions about home assistant

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,320
oh that's good okay so i managed to plug

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,080
it in

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:39,200
let's go let's plug it now so now

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,840
it shoots when it connects to the wi-fi

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,120
there it goes boom it's like hey i

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
discovered attack reader do you want to

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,600
configure it

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,360
sure i configure it

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,200
and finish and it's set up so now

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,559
we actually have a dedicated tag section

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
in home assistant

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,880
and so

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,159
there you go i'm gonna i have one tag

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,559
here like a card

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,159
i'm gonna hold it in front of it boom

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,200
and you see immediately hey

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,039
we scan the tag that's great so now you

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
can scan like a card

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,799
boom it's and also in the ui hey you

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
scan the card

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,559
so this is cool because now we can

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,919
actually start automating it right if we

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,480
want to build our own

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
way like a music jukebox so for example

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,200
we can say this card which was the

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,159
the white card i just had well let's

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,919
just say we call it movie

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,400
and so you can actually scan these cards

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,240
because nfc is also in our phones

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,159
you'll be able to use the home assistant

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
app also to scan these cards and also

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
trigger the same thing in home assistant

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,480
so either you can use a tag reader or

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,120
your phone

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,720
tap it and it will do some automation so

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
now i'm going to do a quick automation

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,520
with this

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,400
so to automate it it's also super easy

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
so we just click

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,840
on the robot and it says okay

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,200
when a tech movie is scanned let me just

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,799
get some more space

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,840
um so the trigger is already set

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:07,679
when i scan the movie tag

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,880
then the action i'm actually going to a

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,880
surface oh man i think it's just like

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:19,280
ah the oh yeah there it is

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,039
my uh the sharing window overlay is like

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,000
just on top of it but it's gone now good

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
okay

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
um so i'm gonna call service so i'm

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,080
gonna call the media player i got play

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,880
media so what i want to do

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,840
is that i had this google home hub i

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,840
just showed

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,880
wouldn't be cool if we can like play a

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,000
video on it

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:45,039
right so right now i'm gonna

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,559
i already prepared so here's like we're

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
gonna write some mini ammo

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,240
um we still have a lot of yaml but we

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
try to like

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,600
when it's necessary for complicated

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
structures we're actually improving this

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,559
one

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,520
we will show some yaml so i need like a

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,440
movie to play

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,440
so i'm just gonna quickly google the

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,400
blender has this bug bunny demo yes i've

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,320
seen that

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,440
which is uh so i went to the blender

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,960
talk at um

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,960
uh last year's uh foster okay

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
it's it's so cool it's like

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,360
i wish more people would like you know i

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,240
know

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,720
there's more software like that okay so

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,840
i'm just

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,679
typing this now but in the future i hope

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
this can do the ui okay so that's it i

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,840
click we're gonna play media we're gonna

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,400
play that video that i just shared

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,000
on the dev display i'm gonna click save

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,080
now of course

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:51,840
i'm gonna show my google home hub

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:51,840
let's see if it works

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,320
there you go amazing so this just

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
happened just when i was

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,440
oh this just happened whenever i just

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,520
scanned it

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,000
but now because now we're playing

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,919
something we can actually see the on my

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
screen the dev display

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,960
oh it makes a lot of noise let me just

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
pause it

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,799
through home assistant yeah that's

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
amazing this is all instant so

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,640
even when i click play here you'll see

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,159
immediately in home assistant

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,279
we know it's playing again and we say

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,520
okay shut it down

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,320
and we're back to the screen wow this is

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,520
uh i mean

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,080
this is amazing for parents because uh

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
i know we i i went through the first

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,120
couple months of the uh

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,039
the quarantine watching frozen two um

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,720
knowing that that was going to be the

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
the go-to it would have been nicest to

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,360
tap the card or give the card

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,039
to my daughter she can tap the card get

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
that get that going and then because we

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,360
know that's

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,520
we're gonna watch that twice a day so i

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,080
might look at that out of the way

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
right i have the same with cars

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,520
excellent

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,360
yeah so yeah i mean this was just like a

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,039
demo of kind of stuff that people built

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,120
around home assistant and how it like

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,440
all smoothly integrates and

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,440
you know when there's just so much fun

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,400
stuff that you can do around this right

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
once you

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,760
i think that the the biggest challenge

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,080
our users have is that

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,360
everything is possible right and people

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,120
just kind of want to have i always have

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,039
those is the checkbox or automate this

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
or do that and

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,880
that's kind of stuff also that that's

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
all obviously also in the pipeline but

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,320
it's because everything is possible when

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,679
you go on youtube you type home

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
assistant

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
i mean it goes all over it's really

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,919
really cool that's awesome so

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,840
so you just walked through a quick demo

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,880
on how to get yourself set up on your

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,600
existing advice

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,080
devices but yeah outside of this are

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,120
there

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,279
like are there recipes or examples or uh

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,520
sort of like a one-stop shop

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,960
so learns um to create devices or to

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
integrate existing ones

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,279
uh actually a little bit of both so

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
integrating existing ones

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,279
i imagine if they can connect your wi-fi

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,799
then you're you're halfway there with

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,720
home assistant is that correct

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,960
correct yeah so we actually if we go to

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,080
the home assistant website

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,159
and we go to uh integrations

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,320
we have currently 1743 different

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
devices and services that integrate into

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,400
home assistant and so

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
i mean there's things like an ikea light

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,520
or lutron or

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
shelly or plaques or sonos like a lot of

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
different things that are just

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,400
they have their own hubs and we

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,080
integrate with that but then we also

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,159
have home automation protocol so you get

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,320
a bit lower level so that's the

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,679
z-wave and zigbee you see at the bottom

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,679
and to work with those

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,440
you actually need like a usb stick right

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,919
so you plug a usb stick

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,360
into your device and then in home

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,640
assistant you set up the zigbee or

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,440
z-wave integrations

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
and then you know it just it just runs

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
and then

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,279
we go from there and there's like a

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,039
control panel you compare

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
and you know whenever you set up

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,039
something in home assistant you can put

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
it in an

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,279
area you can then also make this

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,320
available to google home or

00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:02,000
amazon so you can control it by voice

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,960
um or i mean this the the possibilities

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
are really endless

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
right yeah which is the challenge i

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,520
guess

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
yeah and the challenge is really just

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
sitting down and doing something which i

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
think this could be

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
a world of like like this this could be

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,039
my weekend

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,120
like literally this weekend i might be

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,640
setting up that light outside my room

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,840
to go red whenever i start streaming

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,679
well that's something that we just

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,640
discussed before we went on air but in

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
the

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,679
the home assistant has an app an

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,840
official app for the mac

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,279
and it's actually a port of our ios app

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,159
apple made this thing that's compatible

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,080
for both

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
and it's really cool because once you

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,159
set up the home assistant mac

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,440
app it will integrate and push all its

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
data from your mac

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,279
to home assistant and make it available

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,399
and this also includes when your camera

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
is on or not

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,080
so all of a sudden you can start

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,000
automating hey when my camera goes on

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,760
automatically turn on my streaming light

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,640
so automatically dim the background

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,039
light so

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,000
it looks better for my stream and then

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,080
also like you were

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,919
saying hey let's turn the light outside

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,919
of my door to like

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,320
blink red so people know they don't or

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,799
shouldn't enter

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,520
yes that i before we went on stream i

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,760
think uh

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
uh i have a very little one and they

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,080
came in the room like probably

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,240
five times just to look at me smiling

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,080
and wave high

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
but yeah right yeah that's the that's

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,240
the biggest challenge yeah

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,279
but maybe the red light would would keep

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
them uh well

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,520
they'll probably still come in but you

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
know all the best laid out plans

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,720
right you could set up a motion sensor

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,080
so that when they pass the red light it

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,679
will play a sound on the other side of

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,360
the hallway so they get distracted and

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,039
then turn around

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,880
yeah so there's a um

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
that was actually really funny but i'm

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
looking at this question

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
uh actually it is it yeah it's a

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,360
question um things like this so i see

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,559
the philips hue and like we know that

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,039
philips hues needs like uh

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,279
sometimes they need a um a hub to sort

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,440
of connect uh the different light bulbs

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,720
well you also need a hub to connect

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
through the light bulbs so if you have

00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,880
like

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,559
um if you want to connect your home

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,679
assistant rather than another device

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,080
it it depends so we need so

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,720
philips hue uses zigbee right under the

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,480
hood

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,080
so there needs to be a place where we

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
could con where we

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,840
are able to send zigbee command so

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,919
either you have the philips u-hub

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,960
already set up and then we talk over

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,480
wi-fi

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,120
to your philips u-hub and then your

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,159
u-hub talks to your u-lights

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,720
yeah or you get a zigbee stick a usb

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,559
stick

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,039
and then we talk to the zigbee stick

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,640
generally over serial

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
connection just connected to the device

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,679
and then the zigbee stick will talk to

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,159
your ulights

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,919
and actually the benefit of using zigbee

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,799
directly instead of you

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
is you had is an ecosystem right and

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,840
they

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,600
are not very friendly to zigbee devices

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,039
that are not part of their ecosystem

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,440
so you're less able to

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,279
pull data in and they also don't send

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,799
data to us the moment it happens

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,399
so for example if you have a motion

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,640
sensor in philips u

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,760
hub it can take up to five seconds for

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
home assistant to know

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,480
which is too long right if you enter a

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,039
room the light should turn on right away

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,600
um and so if you have a zigbee stick

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,240
your lights can create a mesh network

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,960
and that's how the data goes to your

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,720
house

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,960
come together with the sensors and all

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,640
the other zigbee stuff that

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,080
would not be available inside the

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,880
philips uhub

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,399
so generally philips u-hub is a good way

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,120
for people to actually get into home

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
automation

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,320
yeah and when they start using home

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,159
assistant they can use it

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,760
and then eventually they can decide okay

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,320
i'm ready for the real deal and then

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,399
they

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,240
go native zigbee okay excellent and um

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,600
i guess my my follow-up question would

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
be is there a place to learn

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,960
some of these sort of like you have a

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,880
lot of experience so is there like a

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
forum or another place where i can

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,200
get some experience from other users yes

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,799
definitely so we have a very very active

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,360
discord and we have a very active

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,880
forums so if you go to our website and

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,039
you scroll down

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,159
then there's the join the community card

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,600
right here

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,600
and there's the forums and there's a

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,880
chat and then

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,679
i mean both are really active so we have

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
you know there's

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,720
some people prefer forums some people

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,159
prefer uh

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,399
chat so we have both available and

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,080
yeah it's all i mean you know if you

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,159
look at the forums it's like third-party

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
integrations installations hardware

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,000
mobile apps

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,120
community guides i mean there's there's

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,559
a lot of stuff so

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,039
two things that are really cool on our

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,320
forums one is share your projects

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,880
this is where people are just like

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,720
sharing

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
new stuff that they are like building

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,320
like somebody built like a

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
refrigerator monitor and they will share

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,080
all the different parts

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,679
and then how they have done it and then

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,440
they will also and this is for example

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,039
an esp home project so that you'll share

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
the configuration

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,799
and then look and they get push

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,440
notifications from the home assistant

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,279
app

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
for example if the door has been left

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,799
open right which is yeah

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,240
cool i i love this and actually

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,760
my original question i think i was

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,279
actually asking for this as well the

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,519
share your project section

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,200
because i want to i want to basically

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,000
find out what my weekend project is

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,360
and just by instead of answering emails

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,720
and doing work i want to look through

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,039
this thing all day

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,399
right so the other thing we're doing now

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,600
is that if on the home assistant website

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,159
um every week and like we we were pretty

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,919
bad at it

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,000
for a while but now we're back at it the

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,120
community highlights so we try to post

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
every week

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,760
kind of cool stuff that people uh are

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,279
doing

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,039
um so i mean this is just like random

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,120
people that are

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,399
finding stuff in home assistant that are

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,159
related to home assistant then we

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,000
highlight like three of them so

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,919
this person for example made a laundry

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,559
card that sits in our interface

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,120
and with javascript is animated to see

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,120
what the state of your laundry is

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,960
and i mean people do so many cool stuff

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,440
with it i'm gonna show you how to do

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,840
some

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,360
cool stuff with javascript also in a bit

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,760
uh but i mean this is

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,120
you know there's a lot of inspiration

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,120
yeah excellent yeah i'm i'm

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
i'm super excited to learn to see what

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,120
more examples you have

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,039
um so yeah definitely take it away there

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,559
was one question though real quick um

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,159
something about home assistant in the

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,679
support for the chip

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,600
the chip chip yes so chip is a new uh

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,360
home automation standard that is being

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,840
worked on it's not

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,679
uh available yet but we're definitely

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,760
going to look into it and integrate it

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,200
and the nice thing about chip is that

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,240
this is the first home automation

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,320
standard

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,159
which is developing their own open

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,399
source reference implementation

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,120
so until now for zigbee and z-wave we

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,600
had to have our own people or you know

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,519
open source developers that built out

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,440
these infrastructure and with

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,039
chip it's actually the companies and

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,159
this is like you know all the big names

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,080
are behind it

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,159
both from like you know the big tech

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
like apple google and amazon but also

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,360
like philips and ikea

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,880
and xiaomi and these companies and

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,559
they're together building this open

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,720
source reference implementation

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,320
that we can all start using so when we

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,919
have this integration going it will be

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,760
super solid very bad

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,240
okay excellent it's good it's gonna come

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,720
definitely

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,879
um yeah so the home this is the home

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,879
system ui i already showed it a bit

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,240
um right like i can turn the light on

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,639
behind me

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,440
and all of this is javascript of course

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,119
it's a browser

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,440
right and so we actually use a thing

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,760
called web components

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,679
and so i want to show you how we can

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,599
actually build our own cards

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,839
and to do that i first need an editor

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
and so with home system i already talked

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
before about how it became like an

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,720
operating system

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,760
and so we actually have different

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,839
besides

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,679
just home assistant you can also um

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,520
install other applications that we have

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,359
figured out like that also run in

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,119
containers so there's a lot of them

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,639
i see almost which got mentioned in the

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,679
chat earlier

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,000
yes that's uh that's a project by

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,720
stanford to build out a

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,079
voice assistant that's open source and

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,079
privacy focused

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,760
um that's b they just got a million

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
dollar grant from the sloan foundation

00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,440
and they're working and they're

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,040
getting some developers to like make it

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
better uh but

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,880
development has stalled a little bit

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
right now

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,119
so in this all these add-ons that you

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,400
can just install some are like for

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,920
example influx db

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,000
is a very popular uh metrics database

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,839
um there is the jupiter lab this is for

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,320
data science so you can actually

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,760
once you install this with one click you

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,839
have notebooks that connect to your home

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,040
assistant database and are you can start

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,040
you know learning from your own data

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,800
um the one that i wanted to show a

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
spotify connect is another really cool

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,040
one it will actually turn your raspberry

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,520
pi

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,160
into a target that you can play spotify

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,880
on

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,240
so if you have you know how in spotify

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,839
you have like which device do you want

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,920
to play on and there's like shows like

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,119
chromecast and sonos devices

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,760
it will actually show your home

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,240
assistant and so if you connect an audio

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,359
jack into your raspberry pi boom you

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,640
have another

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,200
smart speaker but the one i want to show

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,680
today

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,599
is the visual studio code so we all know

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,320
visual studio code it's the

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,520
code editor by microsoft so i'm going to

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,240
install it

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,240
and visual studio code actually uses

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,680
electron right which is technology by

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,040
github to run

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,920
it's pretty much a browser with a node

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,839
backend

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,320
and so visual studio code actually runs

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,720
also in a browser we see that with

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,720
github code spaces we also make this

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,320
available inside home assistant

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,000
and so we make this available inside

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,520
home assistant and then we also

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,160
automatically configure it with the home

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
assistant visual studio code extension

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,200
which is really cool because it sets up

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,240
an active connection to your home

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,640
assistant

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,400
and it will auto complete with like the

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,359
latest state and latest entities

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,640
when you're writing your yaml files okay

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,400
so i'm going to

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,800
show it in the sidebar that's good i'm

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,839
going to start it

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,000
so this is like a demo that like i

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,000
haven't really prepared because

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,520
so we're going to see how it's going to

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,640
go

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,680
those are the best types of demos yes

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,520
so starting the code server i think it's

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,160
good let me just see if i get visual

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,160
studio code

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,200
there you go we are in visual studio

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,280
code so on the left you actually see my

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,400
configuration directory

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
you can see there's like some

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,119
configuration already going

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,720
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,520
that we want to make

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,040
javascript available to our front end so

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,560
we actually have a special directory

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,599
that we're going to create

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,839
it's called the ww directory and

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,280
the moment we create a www directory we

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,280
have to restart home assistant so

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,240
let me see we actually have a

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,200
quick jump in home assistant so if you

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,079
want to restart

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,560
uh home assistant you can just search

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,359
for it

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,040
click on it okay so now home system is

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,560
being restarted so it also means visual

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,400
studio code is being

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,040
disconnected you can see in the bottom

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,839
left well my face is on top of it

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
but the connection is lost um but it's

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,800
okay

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,240
so in home assistant everything we use

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
what we it's called like

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,359
a unidirectional data flow so in home

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,359
assistant with web components every web

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,000
component passes down the state of the

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,320
home

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,440
and we can access this all right so

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,079
we're back in action

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,200
home system started so now we can

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,280
actually create a card

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,040
and i'm gonna walk through this really

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
slow um

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,320
but also sometimes a little fast if i go

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,720
too fast

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
definitely let me know yeah i'll keep an

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,000
eye on the chat for you

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,320
yeah so i'm just gonna create we're

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,320
gonna

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,720
wow okay so we're going to create an

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,560
example card so i

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,640
prepared some basic code and i'm going

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,920
to go through this code

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,599
um what i do here is that you know in

00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,720
javascript we can import right and we're

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,240
all used from writing

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,320
javascript that goes through bundlers

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,920
that we actually import from

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,599
like node modules but that's actually

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,040
not necessary browsers have native

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,040
support for imports

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,280
so what in this example i will import

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,000
directly from unpackage.com

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,320
so unpackage.com and we can follow this

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,320
link

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,160
and you can actually see this is just

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,119
javascript this is going to run in my

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,040
browser

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,160
and because there's question mark module

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,079
in the url

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,200
it will actually import all the things

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
it needs

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,040
as well so the browser is just going to

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,880
resolve and just run all this javascript

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,800
without any bundling

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,280
so i'm going to use lit element which is

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
a web component

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,680
framework so in lit elements you need to

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,040
define the properties that are going to

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,320
trigger a re-render

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,760
so in this case has

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,680
and config are going to be the

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,839
re-rendering when those are

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,800
changed it should re-render so has is

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,079
the state

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,760
object that i just talked about the

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,680
unidirectional data flow and i'm going

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,359
to show what's inside in a bit

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,280
config is going to be the configuration

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,119
for our cart so we want to create our

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,960
own card

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,240
now as temporary placeholder i'm just

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,839
going to render hello

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,839
so that when we look at it we know it

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,440
works

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
when the configuration is updated we're

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,359
just going to store it this dot config

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
and this is just a place or order for

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,119
some css

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,440
okay so this is good now we have this

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
card

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,359
let me make sure it's safe you know my

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,920
keyboard shortcuts work okay

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,440
so the next step is is that we have this

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,040
dashboard but i don't want to mess with

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,560
my main dashboard so

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,720
you can actually create multiple

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,760
dashboards but to do that

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,119
we're also going to add custom

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,040
javascript so i'm going to turn on

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,119
advanced mode

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,960
so just really quick in the settings

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
here's advanced mode

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,599
now i'm going to see more options some

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,839
options that we need

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,520
okay lovelace dashboards so this is our

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,359
dashboard so first thing is is that i'm

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,880
going to tell lovelace which is how our

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,960
user interface is called

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,800
okay that it should load our card so i'm

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,240
going to add a resource

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:09,599
and so i called it examplecard so

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,880
it here so now whenever

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,000
uh lovelace loads it will also load my

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,800
custom javascript

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,160
great now i'm going to create this so

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,960
now it's loaded

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,119
now i'm going to create a new dashboard

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,800
which i call github demo

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,800
um show it in sidebar

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,240
okay create now there's a second one

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,680
called github demo now

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
it looks the same as the first one

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,119
because it's automatically generated if

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,520
there's no configuration for your

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,720
dashboard we just try to make something

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,720
of it um we've recently tweaked it a bit

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,920
it needs more tweaking um

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,760
but yeah so i'm going to edit this

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,280
dashboard so

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
take control of your lovely ui what

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,720
we're pretty much saying is like listen

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,640
we're going to throw away your auto

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,160
generator do you want to keep the auto

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
generated or do you want to just start

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,119
empty

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,880
and so in this case i will be like just

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,480
start empty so that like i want

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
everything to be gone

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,240
so now i'm in edit mode of this

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,280
dashboard and so the first thing is i

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,520
need to add a tab

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
because we need to have at least one tab

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,079
to put things in

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,400
so i call this demo save so now

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,000
i want to add a card so in a home

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,760
assistant we have a lot of pre-made

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,319
cards cards that you can just

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,400
use out of the box and if you you see

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,040
demos so there's like an entity's card

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,599
there's like

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,400
one a single entity there's a history

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,119
there's like

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,000
big lights there's a markdown card so

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
you can have

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,640
um you know markdown i should write on

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,760
github show pictures

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
floor plans it's a possibility and all

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
these things are just

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,520
piece of javascript of course so what

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,440
i'm gonna do now is at first i'm gonna

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,920
uh no i'm gonna add my custom card

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,040
that's the first step so

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,800
i'm gonna go click on manual so

00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,480
my custom card i call it example card

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,800
right so i'm just gonna write here

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,079
example card boom hello

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,720
great now i'm gonna add some entities

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,400
um i'm actually gonna add some fake

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,760
entities as well just so it looks a bit

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,240
nicer

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,560
and i'm going to hit save so now this is

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,160
the javascript that i was just editing

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,359
and it's now available here in my

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,680
browser now i'm going to edit a bunch of

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:31,119
other entities that we're gonna

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,800
um i want to show that like we have

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,040
multiple entities so i'm gonna have our

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,800
uh the wemo inside switch i wanna show

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,560
it here as well so you can see that it's

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,000
all instant so

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,240
here's the switch so i'm going to close

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,079
it down so we have my custom card and we

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,640
have a built-in card and as you can see

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,079
this one just works

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,400
okay so now

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,079
i want to show you how the state object

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,359
works that we're passing around so if we

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,599
look

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,960
in the console here this you can see

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,960
it's a ui

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,160
entities card and because we use web

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,560
components we don't need

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,000
any special browser tools it's all built

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,520
into the browser

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,800
so if we open the console of this

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:22,319
we can actually see oh i have to have

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,880
this one open

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,880
what's going on

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,599
awkward okay well that did not work as

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,640
intended

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:40,480
now i couldn't leave

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,800
um okay i'm gonna find a different

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,800
uh

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,440
look here we have our object so this is

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,880
all the state of our whole home

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,119
and it has some helper functions like

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,800
call servers turn something on

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,720
so the one that we're interested in is

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,319
going to be of course states

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,400
the state has all the states of our

00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,319
whole house so for example our inside

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,119
vimo insight switch we can see the state

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,880
is off

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,319
we can see when the last change last

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,359
updated it's identifier

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,760
okay so now we would like to have this

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,760
state

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,880
also being shown in our cart and i

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,520
actually

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,800
realized that i'm going to open visual

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,400
studio code in a new tab

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,400
i actually wanna um

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,920
what's going on uh mario just dropped in

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,599
console.log

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,400
is a way to log the output see if

00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
yeah but it should so the the with the

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
dollar

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,880
zero it should take the data from the

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,280
selected element

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,160
okay just didn't so what i'm gonna do

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,680
now is i'm gonna just for the i'm gonna

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,510
add some demo lights

00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,720
by having some uh

00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,640
[Music]

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,000
demo lights you can actually see we have

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,040
yammer validation

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,480
yeah so by having some demo lights we're

00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,920
going to be able to

00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,000
uh have some lights that are not

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,680
connected to physical lights that way if

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,200
you're developing ui you're not

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,839
making yourself or your people in your

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,200
house crazy

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,200
so we're going to restart the server

00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,760
again

00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,520
[Music]

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,079
and actually our ui even though we're

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,240
offline it will continue to

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,560
like you can still look at it like it's

00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,319
uh we can still navigate around

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,319
it will just the state will not update

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,560
until we are back online again

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,560
okay

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,800
so i can yeah so this is uh so home

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,839
system is starting not everything is

00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,280
available yet

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,800
we're back online yep i can control my

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,599
lights again

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,920
so now i wanna actually edit i'm gonna

00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,200
add my demo lights

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,119
in uh also in the empties card

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,280
and i'm just gonna quickly use yaml for

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,280
that because i have a copy paste ready

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,280
there you go so these bottom three

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,440
lights they're fake they don't exist

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,280
okay but they're great because i can

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,680
mess with them you can like

00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,720
turn them on we can change the colors of

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,440
them

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,280
and it all shows in the ui okay so now

00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,880
we have this custom card

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,880
and we're already i had already

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
configured my custom card to pass in the

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,880
entities i want to show

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,079
so all that we have to do with custom

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,559
cards is that

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,000
home assistant will set the hash object

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,839
on it so if we

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,280
look at my example card that we have

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,200
here

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,800
if i go click it has i can see oh

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,960
we actually have access to the hash

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,480
object and

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
we have access to the configuration that

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,559
we just typed into yemo so we can see

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,640
it's a type custom example card and we

00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,880
have four entities

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,119
so now it would be cool to show the

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,240
state in our custom cart

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,680
right that's the the goal so we're going

00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,319
to open my example card

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,319
so we know that this is our uh

00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,480
this is what we're rendering right and

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:08,960
so this is actually using tech template

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,839
literal so this is just a javascript it

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,800
was introduced in ecmascript 2015

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,319
and it will just you know you right

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,319
inside a string and it actually gets

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,040
converted to html and it is

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,079
very optimized in updating so what we're

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,839
going to do is i'm going to

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,319
just very basic i'm going to render a

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,880
list just because i know that's like

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,480
you know that's easy so what i'm going

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,839
to do is i'm now going to iterate

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,640
over our configuration so i say

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,480
this.config.

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,920
and i'm going to say for every entity

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,240
that we have

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,160
i want to render something so what we

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,319
want to render is that i first want to

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,920
we just have empty ids an identifier so

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,480
we need to get the state

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,520
so to get the state we just showed it

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,960
was in

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,359
this dot states and so we can just

00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,480
pull it out so we just say hey give me

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,079
the ntid

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,200
now just a small guard because we never

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,079
know what's going on

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,640
if no state don't return anything but if

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,920
there is

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,200
anything then we're going to say render

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,079
this state so we want to of course

00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,200
render the name which is stored as an

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,119
attribute

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,359
friendly name and then we want to render

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,960
the state

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,640
okay so now we have a list and for every

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,359
entity that we passed in we fetch the

00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,599
state

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,000
we print the name and we print the state

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,880
oh and let me just close the ally tag

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,280
okay so now i'm going to refresh this

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,079
and

00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,079
it should all work

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,839
i don't know if i saved it look saved

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,200
oh you know is this a server running

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,359
yeah i should disable the cache

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,119
ah there you go okay we have the state

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,119
as you can see the wemo inside is off

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
bad light is off ceiling lights on

00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,440
kitchen lights on

00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,839
cool let's see if it works yes it

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,680
instantly updates

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,319
because it's all tight right like every

00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,839
time we click on one of these buttons

00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,119
and we actually control a light

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,760
right you can even control the real

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,520
light it will just tell

00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,119
the card hey this is the latest uh data

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,800
and this is all with the websocket

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,359
surface the front end is being kept up

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,040
to date

00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,680
instantly whatever happens in the back

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:28,559
end it also actually means

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,520
if you have two tabs open with the ui it

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,079
will also be

00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,640
instant you can see it instantly update

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,400
on for example if i have my phone open

00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,680
it will instantly update if i change the

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,800
lights

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,559
but of course now this kind of looks

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,079
meh right we want to have some cool

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,240
looking card right we didn't want to

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,640
write javascript just to show the state

00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,079
so what i have some control so to do

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,520
that i'm actually

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,240
going to use this uh

00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,280
framework it's called wired elements and

00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,240
it's a

00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,280
uh web component framework that you can

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,119
use to

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,920
create kind of wireframe so it kind of

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,960
looks uh how you like would draw it like

00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,640
uh

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,119
and so these are actually also web

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,040
components so we can put this inside

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,800
our cart so i'm going to do this and

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,119
i've actually already prepared the two

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,720
import statements that i want to use so

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,040
just at the top of my file i'm gonna do

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,480
paste as you can see i'm gonna empower

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,520
import wired card

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,960
and wire toggle so what i'm gonna do

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,240
first is that i'm gonna in my html that

00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,480
i'm returning

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,839
i'm gonna do let's do a card i'm gonna

00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,040
do an elevation of two

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,040
that way it looks kind of nice

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,920
okay let's see if this works

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,359
boom okay that already starts looking

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,599
nicer right

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,359
we're getting somewhere now of course

00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,880
this card should be as wide as all the

00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,839
other cards this kind of should fall in

00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,400
place

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:02,000
so that means we have to add some css so

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,240
in our css

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,520
and with web components everything runs

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,760
inside a shadow

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,680
root which means that the css doesn't

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,720
escape so i don't have to use any fancy

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,040
selectors

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,720
i can just do whatever i feel like it's

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,319
going to be the selector

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,559
that is as generic as possible because

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,000
it's only tied to the elements that i'm

00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,839
talking about here so

00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,359
in my case i want to just take up the

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,720
space i want it to be a block

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,720
right so the display block

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,280
okay great starting to look better now

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,520
the other thing i just

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,119
pulled in was the wire toggle so that's

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,119
a toggle like this one

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,079
but then it looks like hand-drawn so

00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:44,000
that looks a lot cooler so

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,359
we have the html here

00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,359
i know some people are probably going to

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,960
be upset that my formatting is horrible

00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:52,240
but that's uh

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,520
that's it for now so why toggle

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,960
and so i know it has a check property so

00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,520
we can just do check equals and then we

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,760
say if state.state

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,599
equals on because that's what we know is

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,160
the

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:12,319
that it's on okay so now if i save it

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,520
and i refresh boom we have these

00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,680
beautiful toggles

00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,400
a little big and if i change them we can

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,400
see them updating instantly

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
so this is cool now of course it needs

00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,440
to look a little better

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,440
and they need to work right so

00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,400
to make it look better i'm just going to

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,559
turn these into dips

00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,920
i'm going to remove the state so it's

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,559
just going to be name and the wire

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,680
toggle

00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:41,119
and then on these divs

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:44,720
i'm just going to say okay display flags

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:47,040
justify content space between

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,160
so that like the the name is being

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
pushed to the left

00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,680
and the toggle's being pushed to the

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,599
right we're gonna do some padding on it

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,119
just for the

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:59,040
16 pixels today um and then we want to

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,800
also make sure the text and the toggle

00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,880
are kind of centered together so we just

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,599
do align items

00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,240
center okay so let's see if this is

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,640
gonna look

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:13,280
a little better nice flexbox for the win

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,599
oh yes okay i see i still have the ul

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,160
around it because there's a lot of ugly

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,119
margins so we're going to remove the ul

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,800
that's all from

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,400
our initial demo i'm going to remove the

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,160
h1

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,000
okay so now let's see

00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,440
okay good i think the 16 pixels is

00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,880
actually a bit too much i'm gonna set

00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,559
that to eight

00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,680
i mean it's just a demo but it needs to

00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,680
be visually pleasing

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:42,079
refresh okay this is great and just a

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,599
reminder this is not a dev environment

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,200
right this is just production home

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,799
assistant and we're just kind of messing

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,799
with text files

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,160
inside home assistant to get this all

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,559
going

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,440
so the last step is is that whenever it

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,400
changes

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,240
we need to uh update right so we need to

00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,559
listen to the change event

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,280
so in lit element when you put a dot in

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,960
front of the name

00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,720
it will set the property so it's just

00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,480
javascript objects being passed around

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,720
so this is a boolean being passed around

00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,480
this is not actually

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:15,520
if we look at the source here

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,839
i know it's not very visible um

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,359
because of the zooming but there's just

00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,799
a class on it there's no uh

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,640
yeah you're not importing like things

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,480
like react or view to make this work no

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,160
no no this is as you mentioned web

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,760
components yes

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,280
and so there's but you also don't see

00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,119
the check attribute anymore

00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,599
we know it's set there like we can read

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,480
it out right and we can actually set it

00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,880
here

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,680
to be true and then we see the toggle

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,680
changing

00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,680
in the ui because this is how the state

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,920
works right we whenever we set the state

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,200
it will update itself

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,760
so now we want to listen to events so i

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,680
know that

00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,599
the wire toggle i'm just going to add

00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,440
some white space here just for some

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,319
readability

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,359
we know that when the wire toggle fires

00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,440
like changes

00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,280
it fires a change event so to listen to

00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,720
events on dom elements

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,359
we use the add sign so we just say okay

00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,640
when it's being changed and i actually

00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,400
don't really care about the event

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,440
because i know when they toggle it

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,079
they want to toggle it right so then i

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,319
just can

00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,880
the hash object which gives us the state

00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,480
also had this call service event which i

00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,799
kind of glanced over earlier so what we

00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,119
can do now is that we say hey

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:30,000
call a service so we're gonna just use

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,760
the generic home assistant service

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,480
parent because they know they will

00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,960
figure out if it's a light or switch

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:42,640
then we know if the if state dot state

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,760
equals on we need to call turn off

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,040
otherwise we need to call turn on

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,319
and i'm just going to add some more

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,280
white space because i could already see

00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,280
this going horribly

00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,319
right so the only thing is now of course

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,839
now we would just say hey turn

00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,280
what what needs to be turned on so home

00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,240
assistant also needs to know what needs

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,000
to be turned on

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,799
so i'm gonna pass it as an object

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,640
options object to the service call

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,200
and so we're gonna say entity id is

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,920
state dot entity id

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,520
good so now we say when the change event

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,559
fires on a toggle

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,000
call this surface if it's on call turn

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,119
off service otherwise call turn on

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,319
service and pass in the entity id

00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,599
now of course moment let's see if it

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,559
works

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,480
so we have this i'm going to turn it on

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,680
boom

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,040
there you go so we just build our custom

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,880
javascript widget

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,040
pull in some custom components that are

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,319
just being served from the internet just

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,200
from unpackaged.com

00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,359
no bundling or anything necessary and

00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,119
now all of a sudden we have

00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,720
javascript that is bound to the physical

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,280
world through home assistant

00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,799
right and you can see the moment i turn

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,960
on something here below

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,839
it will immediately update above that

00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,559
keeps working as well

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,559
yeah so in i guess in practice too as

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,040
well if you wanted to build your own

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,599
wysiwyg your home assistant editor not

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,480
editor

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,920
dashboard you could also deploy this as

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,079
well if you wanted to get this in like a

00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,720
react native app or something similar

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,240
so react it's funny you call react

00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,520
because react actually doesn't work well

00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,559
with shadow dom

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,280
so if you want to use react inside home

00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,079
assistant

00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,520
we generally say use preact because they

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,960
they don't have the issue

00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:31,040
or you build your own full ui so

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,240
right now we live in the home assistant

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,079
front end and so the home assistant

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,599
frontal will host your card

00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,760
set up the connection and do all that

00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,119
stuff but actually

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,040
it's actually great you bring this up

00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,680
because you don't have to because yeah

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,200
we published a library home assistant.js

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,799
websocket which can set up your

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,000
websocket connection set up your

00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,680
authentication

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and do it all for you so i'm gonna

00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,119
actually i'll show you a quick demo so i

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,480
have this up on glitch

00:58:53,119 --> 00:59:01,359
and this is actually 50 lines of code

00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,359
so it's the home assistant off demo

00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,640
it's starting up and it's just a static

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,559
website

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,680
it's a static website and when you go to

00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,720
it it will be like

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,079
what is your home assistant instance url

00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:13,520
it's already pre-filled in with the

00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,200
default address which is the address

00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,200
that we also use so i say

00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,960
connect to home assistant now it will

00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,760
connect it will actually show a login

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,480
page

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,000
on my local home assistant and it will

00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,559
say you're about to give

00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,720
has off demo.glitch.me access to your

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,200
home assistant instance

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,559
yes that's what we want so i'm going to

00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,520
log in

00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,280
now being brought back to glitch this is

00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,599
the ui and glitch

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,400
nice this is not any more home assistant

00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,400
so now

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,599
when we go to my wemo inside i can

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,319
toggle it

00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,240
boom and with custom like this is

00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:50,160
completely custom ui

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,799
that is now controlling the light behind

00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:55,520
me and there's no home assistant

00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,359
ui involved at all you can do this all

00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,040
completely yourself and

00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,720
this one is actually really this is

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:06,000
really 50 likes

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,000
so if i open the the editor

01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,480
and we go to the javascript

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,920
so this is this is just a render

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,280
function of what you saw on the screen

01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,280
it's really just like

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,319
it's really plain vanilla javascript

01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,640
create element

01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,000
no framework at all right just create a

01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,359
button and toggle

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,880
call the surfaces but the whole

01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:32,319
uh to create a connection and to set up

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,280
the whole oauth flow

01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:36,000
all you have to do is call like the

01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,119
create con

01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,640
so you have to um just call home

01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,640
assistant websocket dot get

01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,480
off and then for it will take care of

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,920
the whole oauth flow for you

01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,079
and in the end you just end up with a

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,920
connections object and then

01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,760
you subscribe to the entity so that's

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,079
what's happening here and let me just

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,760
zoom in a bit more if you subscribe to

01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,440
the entities here whenever

01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,680
new entities come in whenever a state

01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,079
changes you can just

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,599
render it and then do something with it

01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,640
so

01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,440
here i talk on my light

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,119
new state comes in but if i go back to

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,400
my home assistant

01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,400
and i toggle the light here

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,119
and i go back i also see it's off right

01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,839
because it's instantly updated

01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,720
so even though this is super basic

01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:26,240
javascript

01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,520
50 lines of code okay 68.

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:33,920
um you know it's it's all instant update

01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,920
and it's just really easy to build stuff

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,680
yeah nice uh i'm excited to uh

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,480
to get my hands on this stuff and you've

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,640
walked through

01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,000
and folks who jumped into as well um i

01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,319
didn't interrupt you in the middle of

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,119
your

01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,839
you're setting up the components but um

01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,960
we

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,240
basically got an introduction to home

01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,119
assistant we got an introduction to

01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,720
documentation

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,160
and how to sort of connect devices to

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,720
their dashboard

01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,520
and then uh paul showed us how to build

01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,599
components

01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,119
as well using the connection to the

01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,400
dashboard um

01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,000
i guess the the socket and um

01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,520
yeah this is this is amazing so like you

01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,920
could you could actually have

01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,920
if i wanted to keep a machine downstairs

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,079
and connect to the lights like if i had

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,240
well i do have two laptops but keep one

01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,440
downstairs and one upstairs and i can

01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,520
still be able to connect

01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:24,960
to all my devices and i guess the same

01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,960
with the uh the phones as well

01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,799
excellent so yeah i appreciate you

01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,880
coming through i don't know if you have

01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,000
any more demos or demonstrations to

01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,960
share i know we i

01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,599
can keep going and you know there's just

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,359
um

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,440
no i mean i don't really have anything

01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,760
right now i think you know if people

01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,440
want to like start playing with home

01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,680
assistant right if you are

01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,520
more javascript developer you know you

01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,599
can build amazing front-end widgets we

01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,680
actually have a really

01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,640
strong community also around sharing

01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,799
these widgets

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,079
and you know sharing ideas and like

01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,359
building cool

01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,200
cards or for example how the solar panel

01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,720
generation and your power usage and how

01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,119
much you give to the grid and like they

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,240
show that kind of nice in a graph and

01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:12,720
um the other day i did some uh

01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,160
i took some svg animation of pulling a

01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,200
chord and connected that to a home

01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,480
assistant and

01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,160
i mean if you're into javascript

01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,920
definitely you know check out our front

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,960
end it's really fun to play with and i

01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,799
think the

01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,079
the cool part is that it actually

01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,599
controls something in the

01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,440
in the physical world and it's actually

01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,880
also something that is being controlled

01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,520
in your home

01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,960
um i think actually that's something i

01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,240
haven't mentioned yet but one of the

01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,440
things that's so fun about home

01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,200
assistant is that

01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,440
you can actually use your programming

01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,680
skills to actually improve your own life

01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,880
right a lot of open source work it's

01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,960
about

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,240
enterprise stuff like frameworks

01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,480
building forms

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,400
uh these kind of things and those are

01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,280
fun but that's only if you're building

01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,480
products for like

01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:56,880
a lot of people what's also what is

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,359
for me more satisfying is that with home

01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,119
assistant you're building stuff that is

01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:03,440
directly going to improve your own life

01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,200
or the people that live in your house

01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,640
or if it's not improving life at least

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,640
it's a lot of fun

01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,839
um and that's just something that we

01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,359
don't always see

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,039
right a lot of open source projects is

01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:14,480
about the better website making or a

01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,160
better app

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,079
and here it's just hey we're controlling

01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:21,119
lights it's fun

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,079
yeah yeah indeed and uh yeah i just i

01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,400
i'm a

01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,520
uh a lifelong tinkerer i love having

01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,000
little projects like this

01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,880
and like i'm already knowing how easy it

01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,039
was to get your

01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,480
your stuff and the dashboard like i

01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,400
mentioned i already have a bunch of a

01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,680
bunch of plugable lights that i connect

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,559
to devices just to

01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,480
get lights on and off um simplistic but

01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,160
i'm ready to actually bypass

01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,599
any sort of future echo devices and

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,920
going directly to home assistant for

01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,920
that

01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,440
while you were chatting

01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,880
assistant automation to

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,480
turn off their spotify when they have a

01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,640

01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,079
stop all music and get go get the

01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,160
business

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,680
uh which is pretty cool so i said that

01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,200
the zoom chat folks you saw that in the

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,839
uh the twitch chat as well

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,119
uh if you want to check that out and um

01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,799
the other thing i wanted to mention too

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,240
as well since we're here everybody um

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:21,839
this is open source friday

01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,520
uh we do have a meetup page they're

01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,480
really the meetup page is just the the

01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,160
focus is

01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,680
so we can easily just tell you what

01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,599
events are coming up next

01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,000
um if you have a better way to do this

01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,079
uh i'm all airs you can find me on bw

01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,079
uh and we can set up some automation or

01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,280
integrations to notify people

01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,359
we just don't have a really good way to

01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,680
do it yet and we sort of scrapped this

01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,599
together earlier this year in may

01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,280
had the idea we're all home we might as

01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,119
well bring open source maintainers to

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,039
talk about their projects so

01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,520
you can find out uh what's coming up

01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,319
next which next week is going to be um

01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,599
maintainer organizational uh level

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,000
management for

01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,760
like through the octokit herd uh

01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,160
octoherd is the actual project

01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,119
uh gregor's he was here uh back in may

01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,319
next week we're gonna talk about

01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,880
automating

01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:08,319
multiple repos gregor manages 25 plus

01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,839
repos and he's just going to share some

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,839
insight on how to

01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,520
orchestrate the management of all those

01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,440
projects uh he's like the solo

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,440
maintainer on those 25 repos

01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,119
so he does automate well yeah solo

01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,039
maintain everybody has contributors

01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,640
uh so he will automate a lot of that and

01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,240
they want to talk about the week after

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,200
that we'll talk about ai

01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,039
um automation for testing automation for

01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,400
visual testing with github actions

01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,079
uh so um colby will be here to talk

01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,559
about his github action and how he uses

01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,480
that

01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:38,240
visual testing uh so those are the two

i know just like tinker and have fun i

01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,000
think that is

uh you know play with technology don't

01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,280
always like feel

01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,440
obliged that it has to be pixel perfect

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,240
or has to be super clean code like if it

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,599
works

01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,039
and you just have it in your house

01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,559
that's already good enough and that's

01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,960
like a lot more fun

01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,760
and then sharing can be the second step

01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,319
just you know

01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,720
yeah just play and think over technology

01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,720
