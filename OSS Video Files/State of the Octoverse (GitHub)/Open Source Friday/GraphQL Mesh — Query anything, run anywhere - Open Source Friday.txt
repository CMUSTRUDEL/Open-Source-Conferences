all right welcome everybody to open

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
source friday an

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,399
opportunity for us to talk to open

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,800
source maintainers contributors alike

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,160
uh about the projects they work on and

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,040
uh also a little bit of how they

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,280
they got started and what they're

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,679
working on next and today

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
we've got a special guest and that is uh

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
your gold team

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,680
so you want to say hello hi

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,720
um thanks for having me i'm really

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,519
excited to be here

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,880
uh i'm uli i am a member of a group

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,080
called the guild

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,640
um we do a bunch of open source uh

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
mostly around graphql maybe there's like

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
a

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
the way that open source is being um

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,120
developed today by you know or large

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
organizations

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,520
or um startup companies maybe there's

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
another way

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
that could be complementary to all of

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
this um so i started this group called

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
the guild

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,160
and the original and the idea there is

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,920
that it's like a group of individuals

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,760
that does open source so um

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,440
yeah that's our website it's like we

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,360
didn't have a website for very long

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,880
um so we have all kinds of weird ideas

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,640
uh for example one of the ideas

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
is that all of our libraries that

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
probably some of them are famous and you

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
heard about

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
are not under the guild's name but under

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,040
individuals

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,200
uh names so um like you can go

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
there's like a you click this platform

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,479
thing

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
then there's like a list of all of the

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,560
individual projects we're working on

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,119
if you click on any of them let's say i

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,320
know graphql code generator for example

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,560
it's a bit up i think probably yeah

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
then this project if you go to the

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
github page

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,680
um it's basically under dotan

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,600
um under the town's name and um there's

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,040
many reasons for that but um

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,719
you know the idea is to power the

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
individuals and

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,520
to make it more sustainable meaning like

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,439
if something happens to the guild as a

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,840
group or to the company

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,319
um yeah the individual still has the

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,239
responsibility like

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
i've seen just so many times where the

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
company just companies just deserted

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,120
open source

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,400
um and um and there was no individual

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
responsibility

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
and together with the responsibility

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
comes the benefits as well i mean

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,480
graphql code generator if it was under

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,959
just the guild many there were less

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,519
people

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,080
who would knew about the tan but the

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,040
standard is making the work so

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
yeah so that's how we started and it

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,840
started from something very very small

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
and today

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
i think we're like the largest open

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,200
source group in graphql

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,080
um so it's really crazy yeah and how do

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,840
you sit

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
because i know the graphql foundation

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
that got thrown together

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,440
a couple years ago are you a participant

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
in the foundation or do you collaborate

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,519
with them

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,599
i think about a year ago or something

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
like that um i saw that there was

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,920
actually an opportunity to join

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,599
uh so we just you need to pay some money

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
and then you're part of it so

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,920
i was like okay cool let's do that is

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
that uh um

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,159
i think if you go to graphql.org yeah we

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
just um we actually helped rebuild the

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,560
website it used to be

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,720
uh uh now it's a gatsby website and it's

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
much easier to contribute so we did the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,080
arda from um the guild actually uh

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,360
did the most of the rebuilding yeah um

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
and yeah if you go down to the

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,920
foundation section you can see like

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
um you know all the foundations work

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
which is really exciting and

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
for us we before that we were like yeah

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
you see

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,200
like all kinds of big companies there

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,400
and then you see us which is pretty cool

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,200
yeah so um yes

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,280
it was nice to like join all these big

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,280
companies and actually

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,879
realize that if you want you can really

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,840
affect and change things yeah like um

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,000
for us before that it seems like it's

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
very hard to change and there's like

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
special people there out there that are

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,439
doing special things and

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,480
um now like i think it's

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,199
actually relatively accessible and easy

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,840
once you realize you can do that yeah

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,440
right so can

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,440
we talk more more about the structure of

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,040
the guild and the the members

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,160
um so how big how big is the guild today

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
um it's um it's a

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
it's a hard question to answer um

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,960
because uh

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,280
um so um i think

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,040
uh full-time people that are like

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
actively working on open source

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,280
without interruptions we're around

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
eight or nine right and then there's all

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
kinds of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,080
uh but we also support the ideas we

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
support

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,440
anyone who's who's doing open source

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,600
that is interesting so

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
there's a lot of people that are doing

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
really cool stuff

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
uh in open source and we support them

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
with whatever they need

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,039
so you know they we help contribute to

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,759
their libraries

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,280
we help publish their work we give them

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,080
feedback

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,479
it's kind of like the an extended group

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,560
um

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
so you know a lot of the library the new

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,800
library is now in the ecosystem like

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,759
there's a new websocket library there's

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
a new

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,720
um transports library so we

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
we try to support these individuals

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
because they just do great work so we

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
reach out and we say how could we help

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
um because that's the goal like the goal

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
of the

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,440
the the guild is not necessarily

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,960
um you know it's funny because our goal

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,600
wasn't to be

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
the biggest open source group in graphql

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,479
the goal was

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,080
um to actually just unstuck things that

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,840
are stuck

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,680
and somehow there were a lot of things

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
that were stuck so

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
wow and and grab you all in particular

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
like i think the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
biggest thing that was like the the

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
hardest thing i just watched a uh

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
conversation this morning with james q

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
quick about super bass and their

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
decision to go with the rest

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,919
and i think the the hardest thing that

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,000
folks to adopt graphql was the tooling

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
and that was the conversation for the

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,960
past like the first couple years and

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
it's still a conversation right now it's

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,919
like

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah graphql is great but like the

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,639
tooling's not there

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
and when you look at rest rest has got

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
so many more years ahead of graphql

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,080
so are you when you say unstuck are you

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,919
building general tools and ecosystem

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,759
thing like pieces and legos to help

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,199
people get involved in graphql

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,360
yeah exactly it's like we we just um

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,319
you know every day we work with like

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,319
companies and

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
and that's also part of this open source

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,800
cycle yeah you can see here a bunch of

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,639
them like

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
this is an outdated list but there's

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,639
like more now

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
and the idea was also yeah it's not bad

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
it's like

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,479
um it's even there's even more

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
impressive stuff there now

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,000
but the idea is like we thought we built

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
this kind of cycle where

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,919
um everything we do is then triggering

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
the next step so let's say every work we

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,639
do with a company

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,039
that feeds back to open source that

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,440
feeds back to the community that feeds

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,160
back

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
more clients and it's kind of like it's

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
this cycle

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,360
um and everything we're doing we're

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,199
thinking about that cycle

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,919
and um so that cycle also when you work

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,039
on something

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,280
and you get stuck um you know

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,400
then we try to solve it and then open

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,880
source it and then

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
build a community around it so i think

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,479
the idea that

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
um what we saw by the way a lot of

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,880
people are saying like you said like

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
the toolings are behind but i think also

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
and maybe that's also a bit our fault

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
because

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
like all the tools are scattered around

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
um

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,360
we saw a lot of people that are just

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
unaware of the toolings that are there

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
so that's why we created the website

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
actually because

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,160
all the tools were under individual

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
people but then we saw someone who's

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
using the kojan and

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
they were super happy uh but they didn't

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
even know that i don't know graphql

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
inspector exists

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
or graphql mesh exists so one of the

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
things we've done when we joined the

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
foundation

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,599
like if you can even go to the let's say

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,479
to the graphql.org

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,319
back to the graphical.org uh website

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
then there's uh

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,960
a code section on the top so it

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
completely rebuilt that

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,039
because um and also the design was

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
by orta from microsoft yeah yeah so now

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
it's

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,760
much easier yeah so now it's much easier

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,760
to find

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,000
the two links we also added here kind of

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
like a sorting algorithm to make sure

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
you know if libraries are unmaintained

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,720
they would go down

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,519
on the list you know um so

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
there's all kinds of cool stuff there um

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,480
and the idea is to just

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,200
make it easier for people uh to find the

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,600
right tools um

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
so yeah so and if they're not existing

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,760
then well

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,320
if some of the toolings um

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
but by the way also all that our work

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,839
started from pr's

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
but some of our pr's just got an ex

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
haven't accepted because

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
the libraries were like let's say

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,320
unmaintained anymore so

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,839
we kind of like were forced to create uh

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,120
the libraries um yeah so

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:26,000
um yeah maybe hopefully now i think

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
um the ecosystem is more for like

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
there's

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
i i feel like today if you're starting

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,440
um

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,800
it's a completely different world than

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,200
even like six months or a year

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
you know like there's so many new things

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,959
and not only by us but so by so many

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
people and

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
i i feel like we did like a step change

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
recently like

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,120
now the unblocking became

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,279
like much different um so yeah i i hope

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
maybe even through that today like

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,200
people would find

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,839
um like if you get unblock if you get

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,519
blocked by graphql toolings

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,880
you have someone to reach out to let's

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,320
say like that

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
yeah yeah and it's good to see like

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
there i mean there's a couple of them

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
that i've never heard of i didn't

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
realize

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,680
near form had a graphql um hooks library

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah this

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
is something that i would actually look

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,440
into

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,800
that i wasn't aware of and like a lot of

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
stuff like we were talking off off

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
before we hit stream

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
or start on the stream about conferences

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
and how like streaming has now taken the

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
place of

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,120
a lot of the big conferences because we

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
would run into each other quite a bit at

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
conferences

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
yeah um but i would have to wait for a

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,440
conference talk to hear about this

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,920
thing but now on a stream i'm now

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
educated and i if i want a small little

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,560
hooks library to use my with my graphql

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
i might give this a try i can also see

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,120
that there was a release four days ago

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
so i can have some confidence yeah

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,959
exactly that whoever shipped this

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
release

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,560
um perhaps can answer my questions or at

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
least there's somebody

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
who i can sort of jump in and have that

00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,160
conversation with

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,880
yeah and and i think what we're now

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,640
start this is

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
by the way maybe one of the biggest

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,240
reasons we joined the foundation because

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,200
we just thought about the journey of

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,839
uh like when i mentioned that cycle we

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
thought about the journey of a beginner

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,399
uh

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,279
into graphql and until then we just

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,920
met people when they already knew about

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,760
let's say

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,040
the graphql code generator that total

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,680
wrote or something

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
but at that point they're already have

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,440
some experience

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,240
um we thought well where are they

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,839
starting from

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
like where is the the first place

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,600
someone gets into graphql

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,600
in in that context and let's try to look

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,120
from those uh from this starter and i

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
think that's also kind of like

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
how individual contributors are

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
sometimes more powerful than companies

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
because

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
companies will invest a lot on their

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
website and they will invest a lot to

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,240
make the beginners

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,839
starting on their own websites for us

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,279
and that's not necessarily the right

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
place for them to start

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,800
right they will fight over google

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,000
results you know who's going to be first

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
or something like that

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,560
but for us we just we don't care

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,800
so um we can just contribute it to the

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,720
graphql.org but we have no stake in it

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,360
we have no ownership of it

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
but that's where people start yeah going

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,880
back to like our your example of

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,560
uh like the tan like

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
i haven't heard of the thing he's a real

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,600
avenger yeah he's a real avenger i mean

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
i mean if you go to the guild org on

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,839
github

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,000
um so um

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
you see there's like just individual

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,720
people and

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
we have some stuff here that we could

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
get to on the org itself but those are

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,040
not

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
libraries those are like let's say the

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
web our website is open source

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
like so for example our website is not

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,839
beautiful as you've seen so

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,440
if someone wants to help us like it's

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,240
open source and you can help

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,320
um but those are like just i know some

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,880
random stuff that we have there

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,240
but all the libraries all the famous

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,240
libraries are under

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,000
the individual so you but you can go to

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
the org and then

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
you see the individuals so that's the

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
most important

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,440
most thing to see them and if you go to

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,560
the website you can see like

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,680
the list of libraries yeah um

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,200
yeah now i wonder if they the because

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,399
like i i'm kind of like dumbfounded

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
because i've known about the guild for a

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
while

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,160
i've looked at the website i look at the

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,680
org every now when it comes in

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,720
conversation i'm like

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,639
i don't know what they're working on

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
there's like nothing really here and

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
that was my assumption

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
like probably the last year the last

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,079
year and a half until we now are having

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,160
this conversation

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,079
um but you kept coming up as like a

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,199
thing in graphql and that you all were

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,800
working on stuff and i

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,279
would hear about your contributions to

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
other projects um but not realizing that

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
when i look at

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
the tons like i didn't realize this was

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
part of the the guild i thought this was

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,000
just like one off

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
a person um you know me not reading the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,839
uh

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,079
the entire readme or anything like that

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,320
to try to eventually find

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,920
but um yeah it's a testament about being

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
an avenger and you're all just trying to

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,639
level up space

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,600
fill in the pieces and stuff like that i

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,720
i think there's a

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,360
there's a you know sometimes now we're

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,079
kind of like

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,279
trying you know if some if people want

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,480
to follow us or see

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
everything that's happening because

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,279
there's a lot of things that's happening

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
then

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,160
you know we we put on the website and on

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,760
the website there's like a blog

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,920
and the blog is also open source so we

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,839
get tons of contributions to the blog so

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
if someone wants to blog about something

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,160
um

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
they could actually contribute to the

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
blog but you know so now you can

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
actually follow us

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,959
and you can you know um there's even

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,199
like a twitter account now and there's

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,199
like

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
you could actually like follow the group

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,240
but the twitter account for example

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,519
just retweets the other members yeah

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
because just to keep the the focus on

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
the people

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
um yeah it's a little more decentralized

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
so that way there's like

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,240
if you decide to take a role at another

00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,199
company and remove yourself from the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,920
guild

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
it can still proceed and operate without

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,160
your

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,720
your guidance and uh contribution

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
exactly and and it's very powerful

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
because we can also do things that i

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
guess for a company would wouldn't be

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
beneficial but then they won't have the

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
freedom to do it

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,720
for example contributing to graphql.org

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
which will

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,399
maybe take away um i don't know

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,800
visitors to our website or to our

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,160
products or whatever or

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,360
that we would um support

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,560
libraries and and other contributors

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,399
that are um i don't know that are not

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,399
under the guild

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,680
so we could do those things and it gives

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,519
us a lot of freedom

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,240
um yeah it's just more fun i think for

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,320
the day to day

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
also yeah yeah and i just want to take a

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
quick pause too as well uh folks are

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,880
in the chat and having conversation

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
it seems like a lot of people who are

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
interested are aware of the guild as

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,959
well

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
uh and are quite knowledgeable more

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,639
knowledgeable than than i am

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,720
at the moment so uh y'all if you have

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,279
questions about different projects or

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,079
direction uh about the guild please drop

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
in the chat

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,279
um i have no idea about your private

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,800
repos but if you want to invite me on b

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,839
dougie on github by the way

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,839
um i'm happy to take a look

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,480
um but the going back to the um

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,079
so going back to the guild what are some

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,959
notable projects we can sort of talk

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,320
about and share

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
and sort of highlight what we we have

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,360
you on the chat yeah

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
so um i think uh

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,839
let's see maybe you can go to yeah our

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,920
services and then you can just

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,600
um so

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,000
um let's see so i think

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,680
first thing that um so there's a couple

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
of different projects here by the way a

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
lot of

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,240
projects here we actually some projects

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,120
here we took over

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,160
from other companies and maintainers

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
because they

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,519
stepped down or they just died down yeah

00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,519
but

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
there was a need for someone to step up

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,560
yeah one of them that i i

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
folks if you've been in graphql for a

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,400
while we know that prisma used to be

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
graph cool

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
they haven't stepped away from all

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
graphql stuff but they've definitely

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,679
have pivoted into like a broader

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,160
database operation operation toolset

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,600
in uh best tooling so like did you

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
absorb some of their projects

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,039
and that sort of transition yeah so so

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,480
um

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:30,400
let's see so we took from pris we helped

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:34,320
prisma transition and kind of rebuild um

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,320
uh that was uh a graphql config

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
so one of the things that were very

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
annoying at the beginning and we were

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,080
talking about tooling is that is that

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
um you you have a lot of different

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,039
toolings for graphql but then

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,200
each of the two links has their own um

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
configurations yeah but they share the

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
same thing so we just

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
grab with graphical config we just we

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,880
took all of our libraries and then also

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,039
other

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
people's libraries and we created a

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,960
shared config

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,360
okay um so now you can you know

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
configure all your projects into one

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,799
uh all your configurations into one file

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,280
and that file could be

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,640
you know some we prefer yaml but people

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,320
hate yaml so

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,840
you could basically there's like a

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
library you could use whatever you want

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,880
you know

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
like json or you know whatever format

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,960
you want

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,120
um and now it's all in one place

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,039
so the cogen config and like the

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
inspector graphical inspector config and

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,240
the mesh config and all of those things

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,799
could be in one place

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,360
um and also it's kind of like it became

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,480
we

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,440
white labeled it so like gatsby could

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,559
take it

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
and then call it gatsby country

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,760
you know or something like that they're

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
not necessarily

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
doing that sometimes but they could if

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,520
they they wanted to

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,280
so um or you could share the same

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
conflict between apollo and gatsby

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
let's say or something like that uh so

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,720
that's one thing of course there's

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,400
graphql code generator

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,400
um that i think um some people

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,840
heard of uh i mean like it's probably

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,520
one of our most popular

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,120
library but the idea there is that um

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,400
you could generate uh things um so we

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,480
we said maybe we could create it's as a

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
system as a plug-in like swagger cogen

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,960
was our inspiration

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,360
so you could generate front-end code

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,200
like

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,240
you can generate uh ready-made uh

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,679
react hooks um like if it's pro hill and

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
you see here you can by the way you have

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,000
a whole

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,000
uh playground so you can actually like

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,679
just you have the schema and then you

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,960
have you can have some operations and

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,559
you have config so

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,720
what you see here is like a very basic

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,080
example you have the schema

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,880
and you basically get all the typescript

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,600
types are equivalent for the schema

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,840
now um and that's all you need to do now

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,760
if you scroll a bit

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:59,120
up um on the web on the on the

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,120
on the website yeah um yeah

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,159
a bit down so you can choose a live

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,200
example yeah

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,919
okay um a bit down yeah

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,440
i think it's in delay for me but then um

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,880
you can see you have like

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,200
for the front and you can actually

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,240
generate uh react hooks

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,720
for uh or react query hooks yeah

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,080
so you know or you could generate for

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,320
the back end uh the resolver signature

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,320
or you could use the same and you can

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,840
reuse the plugin so you can do the same

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
for like so everything you see here is

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,960
typescript and frontend but

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,400
you know you know you can keep scrolling

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,000
down you have you know things for the

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,280
backend and for node

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,440
um java flow

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,400
you know whatever you want there's like

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
a whole

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,520
net like there's a whole ecosystem of

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,880
generators

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,159
so um the idea here is it started

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,559
very simple but we just

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,919
kept listening to the community i think

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,960
our core

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,720
um things that every day we are thinking

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,320
about is

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,080
are we in a position where all the

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,720
feedback that we could get

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,600
we could do something with yeah um

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,559
otherwise it's

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
it becomes unhealthy open source project

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,960
so

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
that's extremely valuable because like

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
even just the one example about prisma

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
and how you absorb the projects

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
but i could see other graphical

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,720
companies projects

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,159
uh folks who were sort of out there in

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
the open and have their name attached to

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,159
things could leverage

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,440
the guild to sort of consult i guess i

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,640
assume you're all doing some

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,200
consulting as well uh to help push

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
other projects and ecosystem forward

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
because like

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,919
i guess what i'm getting at it's like i

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,440
see react queer i see apollo i see

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,480
like a bunch of other libraries all

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,039
within this one yeah code generator

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,640
yeah exactly because you know we just we

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
had projects where we needed to work

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
with

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,720
with apollo we had projects where we

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
needed to work with oracle uh we had

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,080
projects we needed to work with relay

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,039
um you know so um and that's

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,360
the idea here is that instead of um i

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,039
don't know coming up with like this

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,400
visionary product roadmap which is cool

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,679
um instead we just solved our day-to-day

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,320
issues

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,559
and i feel like this is something that i

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159
i learned from facebook like facebook is

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,960
open sourcing

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,159
tools that they use in production uh if

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,080
they have really fancy

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,000
ideas but they're not using it in

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,440
production it doesn't solve

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
a problem in the day day-to-day they

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,640
won't open-source it and i think this is

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
a very valuable

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,159
um it's a very powerful concept not

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
saying like

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,120
we need those visionary projects but um

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
i think they need to be marked as

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
visionary

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
so when people start playing with them

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,760
maybe it's not actually answering

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,280
their needs um maybe i i can also talk

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,200
about

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,720
two i guess um big projects i

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
there's a list of a lot of them i think

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
it's worth for people to read and

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,280
there's also

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,120
our blog but i think there's two

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,320
projects that are very interesting that

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
maybe i can

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,159
like just take a couple of minutes to

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,400
talk about yeah um

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,840
one is called graphql mesh um

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,360
i think yeah you can click here

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,679
and then the list

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,280
yeah exactly um the idea here yeah sorry

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,080
for the all the crazy stuff we're

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,880
working on

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,159
improving the improv improving the

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,200
design this is

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,280
yeah it's a bit incense so

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,159
um so so the idea here

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
um yeah maybe we will move to the docks

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
or something because oh yeah scroll down

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
so people won't get that

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,679
like like an attack or something so

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,679
um the idea here was

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,799
you know i saw a lot of you know when

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,200
you let's say you're a

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,679
graphql startup and you want to push

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,240
graphql for everyone so

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,799
now you're you have this obligation to

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,559
say that graphql is better than anything

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,320
right like this is the the best thing

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,679
ever all the

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,640
previous um like all the previous

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,799
protocols are

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,279
are crap you know the holographic is

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,240
dead the rest is that yeah

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,440
so but when you don't have to do that

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,600
then you can just

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,799
you know freely think and then you could

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,600
say well

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,080
what's actually the difference between

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
let's say

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,279
rest with some kind of schema and

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,480
graphql

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,720
and once you start thinking about it

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,799
you know we started thinking well maybe

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,320
we could actually

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,039
take um let's say and also again we had

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
a problem

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
i'll get to the problem in a second but

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
once we started thinking freely we said

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,960
well maybe we could take

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,200
all the existing sources out there

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,120
because when you come to a real company

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
you can't just delete all the code you

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,279
need to work with

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,400
you know open api and swagger json

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,840
schema

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,120
maybe soap apis

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,360
kafka streams all kinds of things so we

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,120
thought well maybe we could take all

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,840
these different sources

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,919
and we could automatically convert them

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,120
into graphql schemas

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,720
so as the consumer

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,240
you could query them as if they were

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,080
graphql

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,000
also like if we would want let's say we

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,000
would want to make a product out of it

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
we would make it like this central

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,120
centralized thing like you take all the

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,880
sources

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
you merge them together into one big

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
graphical schema

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
and now all your organization and your

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,880
code needs to run through that

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,000
and now you can charge tons of money for

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
it yeah which is

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
okay but if you think about the right

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
architecture you think maybe that's not

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,279
necessarily

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,679
how you want it to be like what if we'll

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,679
take all these sources

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,720
let's say generate or compile them into

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,559
graphql

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,600
and now let's generate um an sdk

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,960
and that sdk could sit on the client it

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,640
conceived on a

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,360
on another service so now each

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,600
you get as as the consumer um or is the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,159
front end you get to query

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,880
one graph you get to send just graphql

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,720
queries

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,000
and you feel like everything is in one

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,880
place and it's

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
like it's centralized but that sdk will

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
actually

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,039
call the individual distributed

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,080
services in their own original protocols

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,440
yeah so it's grpc for one

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,440
and like rest for another um

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,520
but but you get the cool stuff from

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
graphql and you get maybe the benefits

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,279
of

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,679
some performance from grpc or you get to

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,039
reuse all your existing services

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,679
um so that's graphql imagine it could

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,720
also run

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:53,840
as a as a as a gateway

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,279
but it could also run as an sdk now

00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,000
another thing here is that um

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,440
once you actually uh get all these

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,039
sources and you want to merge them into

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,200
one graph

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,520
um we didn't want at the beginning to

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,919
take any opinion about that because

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,159
there was apollo federation which is a

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,279
way to like merge together

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,360
all kinds of different sources but we

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,679
saw that it's not necessarily answers

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
for

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,159
all the different use cases so

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,080
we actually took over graphql tools and

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,440
schema stitching from apollo which was

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,399
deprecated

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,760
we revived it and now if let's say if

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,320
you use graphql mesh you can actually

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,159
choose

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,480
between apple you could use a poly

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,880
federation with graphql mesh

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,080
or you could use schema sticking with

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,120
graphical mesh

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
um is federation is that a paid product

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,080
is that something i have to pay

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,440
to use because i can take it no okay

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,080
so so it's it's a kind of like a spec um

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,279
um on top of graphql it's kind of like

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
an extension

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,960
on top of graphql that apollo uh is is

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
uh

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
but you have actually a lot of different

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,080
implementation for that specs

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,240
implementations for that spec for

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,399
example mere form

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,600
um has their own implementation of

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,240
federation

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,240
um and there's also netflix says a

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,600
library called

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,880
dsg i think uh for java uh that

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,200
understands the federation spec um

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,120
but yeah for example that there's net

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,440
hot chocolate it's like the main

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,799
framework in the network and their

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,320
approach is much more similar to

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,159
graphql tools schema stitching like

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,480
with mesh you can choose basically all

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,799
those different strategies

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
but maybe i'll just share one more

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,760
library

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,080
that i think is very very interesting i

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,240
don't know there's a bunch of stuff like

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,279
uh you see there's a federation example

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,399
grpc

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,120
soap um all kinds of

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,520
let's say sources that existing sources

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,720
like

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,480
um let's say uh

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,200
stripe like stripe doesn't have a

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,120
graphql api but now you could just

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,000
you know with two lines of code you can

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,760
get a graphql api from stripe

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,880
okay using our rest apis yeah exactly

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,559
and they're open api schemas um so it's

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,760
really cool uh we worked actually with

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,600
microsoft on

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
we're still working with them on all

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,520
data uh so old data is

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,480
very interesting protocol there's a lot

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
of similarities between all data and

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,720
graphql

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,000
so we took actually the microsoft graph

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,039
which is probably the largest um data

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,880
api

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,039
out there and we they had projects to

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
try to rebuild it with graphql manually

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,640
didn't work it was two three years ago

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,159
and we just converted it completely

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
into graphql uh pretty quickly arda did

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
that

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
but then we reached out to them and

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,120
today we're collaborating with them a

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,440
lot like it's

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,520
we actually there's now like a lot of

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,520
debate within us and them about

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,760
you know what cool things there are on

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,960
all data that we can carry to graphql

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,480
and the other way around um so this

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,480
whole graphql mesh

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,200
project became this center of

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,440
talking around differences and

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,399
similarities between different protocols

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,399
yeah um yeah so just people can go to

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,799
that and um

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,120
yeah uh there's a there's a i have a i

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,520
did a workshop somewhere online on

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,559
like stepped on step one step like step

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,799
by step how do

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,799
you can integrate graphql mesh into like

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,080
an existing project

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,200
um but yeah we can talk about it later

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,960
there's one

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,960
thing i do want to present today that i

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,559
think is cool uh last thing that i'm

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,840
just gonna talk about like that

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,640
yeah uh and that's uh it's called

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
envelope

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
this is a new thing it's open source but

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,919
we didn't launch it yet

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,360
okay so um

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,159
envelope today there's like um

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,080
the most famous uh it's basically what

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
we're gonna see here is is

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,480
a new you can call it or a new server

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
framework or basically a graphql plugin

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,880
system

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,840
okay so the reason we created that

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,399
was that we kind of like became stuck

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,840
between graphql gs the reference

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,600
implementation

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,399
not moving fast enough for good reasons

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
and the most open source the most

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,720
popular

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,039
server libraries that are basically or

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
unmen are not maintained or are not

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,320
being up-to-date

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,399
um and are not being flexible enough

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,480
so what happened is that let's say

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,840
there was huge fragmentation in the

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,200
graphql server

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,559
uh ecosystem because let's say

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,320
you created your schema through uh

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,360
schema first uh using graphql tools

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,399
then you had to build your own

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,519
full server like with apollo server um

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,080
you couldn't reuse

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,480
things and share code between people who

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,679
were let's say using graphql nexus

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,360
from prisma yeah and you couldn't share

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,159
things from people who use typed graphql

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,519
um and also when you you actually

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,080
mentioned at the beginning of your talk

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,240
they said

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,120
things are hard all kinds of toolings

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
like

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,559
caching tracing um

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,600
um uh all these things became

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,600
very hard um rate limiting

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,720
there were whole there was a lot of

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,640
people gay gave

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,880
really interesting talks about it you

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
know in conferences and stuff like that

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,720
but it shouldn't be that hard yeah so

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
what we've done was

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,799
we actually thought could we hook create

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,880
a plugin system where

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,440
we could hook into graphql gs itself

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,039
and then you can just install a couple

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,080
of plugins

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,279
um and you can share those plugins

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
between

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,720
whatever way you want to build your

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,919
server you want to use

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,559
nexus you want to use graphql tools it's

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,120
all fine

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,080
you want to use festify you want to use

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,440
express

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,120
it's also fine it doesn't need to matter

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,720
about how you do graphql so

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,880
this is we're going to do a very big

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,880
launch for this thing soon

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,720
um but we already open sources and a lot

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,519
of people are using it

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,279
okay what what what what you can think

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,840
about is kind of like

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,640
a framework for building graphql

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,760
frameworks so

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,360
um what we've what we're now in the

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,880
process is actually

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,960
we created prs for basically

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,399
every graphical framework out there so

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,440
we created a pr for apollo server

00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,799
we created a pr for parse

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,640
we created a pr for nest gis we created

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,399
a pr for loopback

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,879
and we created a pr for redwood um

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,399
so um redwood is gonna we basically

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,440
finished the pr so it's gonna be verge

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,839
very soon

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,200
um and now all of these frameworks

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,040
you can choose whatever frequent

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,119
framework you want but then

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,200
the way you're doing tracing the way

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
you're doing um

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,440
like if you scroll a bit down there's a

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,960
list of uh all the different

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,879
so the way uh you're doing vlogging

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,359
uh all these things you could use sentry

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,000
data dog open telemetry

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,599
like off the way you do off all these

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,960
things could be shared between

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,079
all these different frameworks yeah

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,879
um so this is like a really big deal for

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
us

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,560
um and just this is another

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,280
cool thing that happened we spoke with

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,879
prisma

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
because he said we talked earlier about

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,960
the fact that we're taking uh

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,079
libraries from them and people from the

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,920
graphical world probably

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,880
know about graphical yoga it used to be

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,000
like a very powerful or a very famous

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,079
server and it's got a bit left behind um

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
prisma just transferred that to us so

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,560
what we're gonna do

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:21,040
is we're gonna basically rebuild

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,599
um graphql yoga using uh envelope

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,000
and we're gonna do it in the open so we

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,640
open the new issue on graphic yoga

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,040
and people could just ask whatever they

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,599
want

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
and we will create it uh on this new

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,680
infrastructure

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,119
um yeah yeah so there's a comment that

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,320
just got dropped too as well and also

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,320
ajc webdev

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,160
who hangs out the redwood team a lot so

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
he dropped a link earlier in the chat so

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
folks who want to scroll up

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,760
and grab that link for that i guess that

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,160
pr whatever's happening there

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
um but there was also just a comment

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,880
from n1

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,599
ru 4l uh about envelope

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,320
allowing future graph kill features too

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,760
as well is that

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,680
oh yeah yeah yeah that's a good point so

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,040
i i everything i mentioned now is

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,079
basically us

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,000
is um how we solve

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:15,200
the problem of the the uh let's say the

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,040
the the frameworks like that we couldn't

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,640
hook in we couldn't do some things we

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,760
couldn't use the new stuff

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,240
here there's two cool things here one is

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,560
that we could use the latest graphql

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,320
also the experimental features i i'll

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,680
mention some of them one is defer and

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,960
stream

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,520
so when you send a graphical query

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,960
until today you will get back one single

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,960
response and that's cool

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,720
yeah but what happens if some of those

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,359
fields are calling let's say a different

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,920
service

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,880
and that service is very slow what if

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,839
you want to get

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
partial results already and then later

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,480
get

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,280
the rest of the results so that's a

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,599
really powerful feature of graphql

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,839
and other features you can build on top

00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
of this capability is live queries

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,720
you could send a query and that query

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,760
will just every time there's a new

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,960
result you will just

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,000
get pushed in your result so all those

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,200
features

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
you could use today uh with envelope

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,320
um and the libraries that actually uh

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
are

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,839
all building it some of them are being

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,680
built by

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,520
guild members and some of them are being

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,640
built by um

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,680
people we support um so

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,320
we kind of like um uh and

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,839
like i said we kind of like unblocked

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,480
the the ecosystem for

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,839
using all these new things and there's

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,440
another cool thing that

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,240
this maybe uh i'll mention which is

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,599
um as i said there's all kinds of our in

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
the graphql world there's a lot of

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,119
uh new features and it comes in the form

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,960
of an rfc

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,720
you're starting an rfc there's a very

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,520
long debate um

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,280
for good reasons um and then it needs to

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,079
go to the reference implementation that

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,359
also

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,599
uh can be very slow here with those

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,960
plugin systems we basically hooked

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,000
into each function that graphql

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,280
js exposes that means that

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,800
any rfc we could implement

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,320
already now as a plugin so what

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,280
and we are already using it today

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
basically you can look at envelope

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,839
is kind of like babel for graphql

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,720
okay so with babel you you could use new

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,920
graphql

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,000
new javascript features before they were

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,160
you know implemented in browsers or

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,280
before they were standardized

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,400
we are now using envelope for the same

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,200
uh with the same capability like there's

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,079
there's a lot of cool stuff like one-off

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,240
directives and all kinds of rfcs

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,200
and we just this week we actually

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,640
created

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,680
uh lauren from the guild created the

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,760
um basically a working plugin

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,760
for envelope that basically you could

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,920
use it today already

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,680
okay very cool yeah that is uh

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,040
like fascinating stuff stuff that i'm

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,960
actually going to uh i'll give that a

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,440
star because i want to watch

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,560
uh what's happening uh with this project

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,400
actually

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,079
i've been we have to actually maybe at

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,560
the custom yeah

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,760
yeah yeah so i want to i want to see

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,119
what's going on in this project so i'm

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,119
going to watch the uh

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,680
releases and discussions yeah i'm also a

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,480
like a guitar notification fanatic i

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,400
like uh

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,599
i have to have inbox zero at the end of

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,240
every day

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,079
the real the real inbox zero that i care

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,040
about is they get them notifications

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,480
everything else is boring yeah i i do

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,839
that with mentions if i have

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
i i make sure i get through all my

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,760
mentions uh during the week uh but i

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,640
can't i can't capture

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
every issue mainly because i'm on at

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,920
github we use github to build github so

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,520
like i've got i've got stuff or

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,000
notifications because my team was

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,960
mentioned

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,760
on a completely different other repo and

00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,200
so i

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,520
can't ever get down to the inbox here i

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,400
could i guess if i was super

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,960
super focused on it but yeah just i've

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,599
given up on that yeah

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,240
yeah i'm i'm a fanatic for it but but

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,280
it's like

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,520
uh it's hard it's very very hard

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,880
but but it's the most interesting f like

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,240
it's for me it's

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,000
more interesting than i don't know

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,599
twitter feed or facebook

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,599
like this is the fit for me

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,560
i mean we're already monetizing a bunch

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,480
of other stuff but um

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,160
but hearing that i i do know we have

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,119
some features coming down the road to

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,359
make a little more

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,880
intriguing to uh you know check out your

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,319
feed on a regular basis

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
um so i'm looking forward to that in the

00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,440
future which i'll be in touch on that

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,480
when we uh start beta

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,880
yeah um awesome we do have ten minutes

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,160
left

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,319
um i don't know if you wanted to show

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,560
off anything else um

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,440
we talked about a lot of these projects

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,520
yeah so maybe

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
some projects i think people could like

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,200
look in and they could check out

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,760
now they know where their website is and

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,400
hopefully now also graphql.org is better

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,880
and

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:10,079
mostly um you know now graphql.org

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,960
is uh contributed ball so

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,400
like if you anything you see you can

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,200
contribute so

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,560
and if there's an issue if you're scared

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,760
of contributing

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,280
if you're stuck uh just let us know

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,720
like we are on the website there's like

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,400
if you go to our website um you can see

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,280
like we have uh

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,520
you can just reach out like um you could

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,920
you have if you scroll down

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,720
um you have yeah first of all you have

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,520
this thing

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,359
that looks like uh it looks like a an

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,079
annoying bot that we're gonna sell you

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,000
something

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,920
yeah but if you're gonna write there

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
then one of the guild members is going

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,200
to write back

00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,720
and we get a lot of yeah let's just go

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,800
to a um

00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,480
like how are you managing this is this

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,880
opening it's called crisp

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,880
uh unfortunately no even though we had

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,240
an inter we i talked with the ceo and

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,800
tried to uh

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,480
convince him to open source it uh or if

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
someone has like an alternative that is

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,119
open source would love to switch

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,079
but it's just what that gave us is we

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,200
got we have it on

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,800
all across our websites we got to

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,359
um get feedback or get people that got

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,240
stuck

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,079
where they got stuck in yeah so at the

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,400
places there got stuck and so this is

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,440
like

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,599
was very good complementary for us

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:34,800
for github issues uh our discord channel

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,480
um the graphql slack uh this was like

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,720
another complimentary thing so you can

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,079
just write to us on each one of those

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,079
channels

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,560
and of course github discussions is like

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,040
really really cool so

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,760
we're we're entering everything yeah so

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,359
actually

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,680
the very first one of these streams i

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,800
did i actually did on my personal twitch

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,079
and it was with this project um

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,599
which essentially it's the same bot um

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,319
but it's open source and it's built and

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,000
react i don't know if this is awesome

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,520
it gives you the same features and bells

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,880
and whistles um

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,480
but it was like some sort of like

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,200
project their their team did is like a

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,720
little fun

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,720
hack project that's become something

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
bigger so

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,800
like open source intercom or

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
help scout yeah yeah yeah all this other

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,200
stuff

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,280
this is awesome and because it's open

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,440
source maybe we could like

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,880
merge that with all the other feeds you

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,839
know that we get everything into one

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,560
place and then it's

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,520
just like you know it will be easy for

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,520
us to answer but

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,720
it will be anyone could reach out from

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,400
anywhere yeah

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,839
that could be really like whether it's

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,560
github discussions or

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,640
discord or whatever yeah and why this is

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,839
top of mind is because i have an issue

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,280
in this project where i wanted i wanted

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,040
to also have a chat bubble

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,200
and i wanted this to also mirror in our

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,640
discord so that way anybody in the

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,880
discord could answer a question about

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,000
somebody getting stuck uh in the

00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,200
project because this well i don't know

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
if you know about this project but this

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,119
project's

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,119
i'm pretty sure i talked about this

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,800
project last week as well but it's a

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,960
project to find your next open source

00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
contribution so if you just want to get

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,000
open source having a little chat bubble

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,359
of like where do i start or how can i

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,599
how can i figure out how to do this or

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,880
whatever um that's what i was trying to

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,319
read this is awesome

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,119
i did a punching bubble though

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,720
i i need to look at it because um the

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,480
last thing i wanted to mention

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,760
um is actually our

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,200
um let's say contribution

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,079
um support system okay yeah which it

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
might be interesting

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,880
yeah i wanted to ask about that too

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,920
because i think vortex actually dropped

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
in the chat about

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,839
what's the pipeline look like for

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,240
contributors the these projects yeah

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,000
community as well so you mentioned the

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,760
graphql foundation but yeah if you want

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,200
to talk about that sort of pipeline and

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,280
how that works

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,640
yeah so for me i always think about

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,480
these things as like

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,079
i mentioned the beginning a cycle or

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,359
kind of like a journey

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,440
um so like i said like everything um

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,160
that we get we try to think what's the

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,359
origin

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,680
of this thing so and what's the path so

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,359
for

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,040
that's why we got into graphql.org

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,079
because we realized like

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,119
yes every issue that people have

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,119
on our libraries they started from

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,319
graphql.org there's some maybe just a

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,000
lack of knowledge

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,000
and that knowledge could you know be

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,800
beneficial for beginners

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
so that's why we cared about that now

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,359
same things

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,400
go for this contribution pipeline so

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,920
um we actually vignesh from uh uh

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,520
from the guild just wrote a blog post

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,880
about it like if you click on

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,920
the blog um there's a link there

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,560
now if you scroll a bit down

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,280
the making open so this is basically we

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,280
open source

00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,760
how we do open source okay so um

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,800
yeah there's a just a link there uh

00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,079
contributor

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,359
uh the guilds contributor guard yeah

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,400
so this thing lives under the guild org

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,000
actually yeah and this dock uh i'll just

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,440
run through it very quickly if you go

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,720
all the way up

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,079
um first of all uh there's a bit about

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,960
our philosophy and everything we talked

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,520
about but then uh vignesha click

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,960
actually created video tutorials on how

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,119
to contribute

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,480
nice which i think is extremely valuable

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,839
like sometimes you just

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,000
want to look at you know there should be

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,960
more tutorials on contributions are not

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
the only usage so that's a starting

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,640
point for that

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,880
but then we also imagined a path so if

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,839
you scroll a bit down

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,359
um there's the typical workflow so you

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,000
know it starts with like

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,599
you have an issue so we're basically

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,079
what we're describing here

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,760
and we want to visualize it um somehow

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,839
so if someone wants to help us

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,280
visualize it as a map or something i

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,920
think it would be really

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,280
cool because a lot of text is always

00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,720
hard

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,160
but basically um you have

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,880
um you know you start with an issue

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,640
and then maybe it's just a lack of

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,800
knowledge or lack of docs

00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,160
so we just want to always highlight

00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,880
where you are in the process and how

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,559
um you could get to the next step and

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,520
then the next person that will come

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,160
after you

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,720
will also push that for the next step so

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,640
you know

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,160
it's opening an issue creating a

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,200
reproduction

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,400
um creating a failing test

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,599
um you know solving it locally

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,359
um then submitting a pr like all these

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,160
things and it's all with

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,160
um you know just what what we saw is

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,319
that it's not necessarily that

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,760
people are just it's not that it's hard

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,040
it's just that they don't know

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,160
what's the next step or what to do um

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,839
so we first of all build the path which

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,520
we described here and then we created

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,200
video tutorials

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,960
to help you go through each of these

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,119
paths and

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,480
we published that i think a month ago

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,400
and

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:11,280
it's crazy how many more contributions

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,200
we got yeah like it feels like all the

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,640
issues just started

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:20,720
um advancing themselves yeah like

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,319
it it's been amazing and this thing

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,559
shouldn't be in my opinion under the

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,960
guild's org it should be

00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,839
i know under github or like you know we

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,200
we want

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,720
others to like actually look at that

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,960
and you know improve it because there's

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,440
nothing guilt specific

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,280
um i'll just mention a bit if you scroll

00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,839
a bit more down that's like the most

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,720
important part the contribution but then

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,160
um there's stuff here about how to

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,920
contribute

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,000
even if you're not contributing to code

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,520
because that's another you know

00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,720
i think it's very similar to probably

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,200
the project that you've seen and you've

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,680
seen it

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,960
way more than us like yeah people want

00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,200
to get into open source but it's just

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,720
you know they don't know where to start

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,640
and then the last part

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,559
which i think you know other library

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,880
maintainers could use is

00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,839
basically how we maintain and what

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,359
toolings we use

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:16,160
to uh to create our own um

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,800
uh the shared tools we're using across

00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
all our

00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,559
libraries because we have a lot of

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:24,160
libraries the future

00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:26,960
oh we would love to contribute for

00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,480
whatever you're working on yeah so this

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,839
this needs a bit of a refresh

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,760
we haven't touched this in about a

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,680
couple years like two or three years

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,599
um but yeah i'd love to get like some of

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,920
that context you have

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,839
in your your one your standoff

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,160
contributor workflow guide

00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,920
because a lot of this is more about

00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,559
finding good first issues finding

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,400
projects

00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,839
finding this sort of this finding

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,520
community in general

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,359
exactly but there's not a lot of what's

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,839
the next step and what your file looks

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,640
like

00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,319
is that next step of like okay yeah the

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,079
path

00:49:55,319 --> 00:50:02,000
yeah yeah

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,960
and and i think um yeah this path is

00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,599
very similar like

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,119
i actually started this path uh trying

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,280
to contribute that

00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,880
to the angular projects many angular

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,160
projects many years ago

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,920
yeah and they didn't take it but for us

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,160
we finally got and i then i tried to

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,559
contribute it to the meteor project

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,880
and then to apollo and now i can finally

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,640
decide on things so i can i

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,960
we just created it and um it's been

00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,040
really successful more than i expected

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,040
we we actually not only that we got more

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,280
contributions

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,119
actually people stepped up and now we

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,760
have in a bunch of libraries for example

00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,440
for example graphql eslint

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,119
someone from the community is now an

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,680
official maintainer

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,559
because they just followed those steps

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,880
and then

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,480
they just took over the project

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,359
basically which is the best thing that

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,319
could happen

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,920
yeah um no that's that's great that's

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,040
that's the goal is like you want to get

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,800
you want to pick the interest of that

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,720
way you're able to level up folks that

00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,000
can then level up more folks

00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,960
um so i'm sure their experience are now

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,599
engaging in like even just your the doc

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,040
that we're

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,119
just scrolling through like the the

00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,559
individual that contributed this to

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,880
your project um yes is now leveling up

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,079
other folks because they were able to

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,160
sort of lay out the sort of the

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,040
guideline and like whether the path

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,800
is is static or maybe like step zero

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,240
turns to zero a or zero b

00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,400
or whatever it is like this is all

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,720
learning that i think you're

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
developing because like even uh we

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,800
didn't cover it but like your one of

00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,000
your projects had

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,920
a discussions it's like this is part of

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,040
the contributor path that didn't exist

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,720
you know last year

00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,319
uh perhaps with stack overflow or

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,319
somewhere else or a discourse

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,720
um but this is part of the the the

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,240
contributor workflow where

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,319
i'll what i try to do is try to get

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,119
people involved in projects

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,839
in a capacity of like if i've got 72

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,200
issues

00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:59,040
in my project can i can i encourage

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,800
someone to contribute in a way of like

00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,079
can you just label these issues or could

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,079
you just like

00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,440
you know add request more context

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,400
because like there's so much you can do

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,000
with the bot

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,000
but when you have a human that's exactly

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,400
who gets you to inbox zero i guess per

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,640
se uh going back to your earlier comment

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,440
um yeah they were able to level up and

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,040
sort of

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,800
exactly what you're doing it's funny

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,839
because we now like we're broadening our

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,240
conversation where

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,960
before you were just leveling up graphql

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,440
um

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,480
yeah and that open source but it seems

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,240
like

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,920
this project your projects have the

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,680
ability to level up

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,960
more of open source outside of graphql

00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,960
too as well

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
it's amazing to hear from you saying it

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,160
i mean it's uh

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,200
and to be honest graphql was also it's

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,160
also just a tool

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,680
for us yeah so it's not like like i said

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,680
it's not like we're

00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,040
um you know it's just it's it's been a

00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,680
good tool for us so

00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,720
it's been valuable to create things but

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,319
um

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,240
you know like bob the bundler has

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,880
nothing to do with uh

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,680
with graphql for example yeah um i think

00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,440
i can and i

00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,240
agree with you also on the bot stuff

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,640
like there's a lot of

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,240
projects with a lot of contribute with a

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,440
lot of traffic that try to use

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,079
bots which is i think it's cool

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,200
but i think having someone actually

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,800
reading

00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,280
the issues and you know looking at the

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,680
path and directing people

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,480
this is the most valuable thing and

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,520
there's

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,000
i think enough people who want and can

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,760
do it just like you said and they just

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,839
need a clear path

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
um and they could level up each other

00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,800
like you said this is really inspiring

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,680
