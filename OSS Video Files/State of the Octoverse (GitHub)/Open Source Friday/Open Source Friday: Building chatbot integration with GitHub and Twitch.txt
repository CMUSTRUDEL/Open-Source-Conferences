but you know i'm in melbourne i'm in

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
australia like people just think

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,920
australia

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,119
is just warm hot dry place all the time

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,240

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,079
no no no no no no it's like i'm in

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
melbourne which means four seasons in

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
one day

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,479
like it'll be 41 degrees which is the

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,040
equivalent of your 106.

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
and then the next day it'll be 19

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,719
degrees which is your equivalent of like

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,920
66 so yeah

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,280
that's some fast uh calculations you uh

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,759
you must be ready to write some code

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,600
today

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,360

on the last session which was nearly

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
three weeks ago now which is probably

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,840
more than three weeks ago

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
about a month ago uh we started creating

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,440
a

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
github chatbot for the twitch channel so

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
today

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
we are going to continue that clean it

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,519
wow just hang around the chat then i

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,440
don't feel like friday for you right

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
that's just saying it it's always friday

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,280
somewhere like oh like yes

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
it's five no i forced that one i was

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,760
like the sayings like it's five o'clock

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
somewhere right

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
like that's the actual thing well slo

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
says it's friday where they are too so

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,879
tell us that you are so we can like i

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,000
can't understand a thing

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,800
wow you can't understand because we're

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
kind of like on a

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
time space continuum here so b dougie's

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,680
over

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
in thursday land i'm in friday land so

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,319
that's probably why i can't understand

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,200
anything british

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
no i'm aussie all right let's get going

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
is it

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
oh look this looks like inception so

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
that's the last one

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,519
that's the last one you can see i'm

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
wearing something different so that was

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,599
the last stream

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,959
and now we're back to here so brian

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
would you like to talk us through a

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,920
little bit just those who

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
weren't here would you like to do a

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,840
quick recap of

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,120
our chat thought that we did from last

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,239
time

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,760
yeah yeah folks we um and uh we have

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,400
a chat integration called get twitch

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,840
and it's aptly named it's a integration

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
to connect github

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,159
the api into twitch interactions

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,760
on twitch um so last week we if you if

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,799
you want to get the tl dr the cliff

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,239
notes of the video

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,680
we got to the point where we integrated

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,560
this into or the stream that we're on

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
right now

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
uh and every time you start this repo

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
that you're looking at

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,520
uh it will actually do a couple things

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
it will do the animation

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
of the daft puncta cat but also i think

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
it still says flex

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
i'm not sure i can't remember if we

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,680
disabled that or not

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,639
uh i think we tried to disable some of

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
it and then

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,440
um people are still using the not

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
local version so it was still saying

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,320
flex

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,919
in the background the whole time we

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,919
managed to disable it locally

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
yeah excellent well um i guess we're

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
going to figure that out really quickly

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,960
if it's still enabled or not um uh but

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
also i do know how to disable it

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,199
if we uh if we do want to go down that

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
rabbit hole too as well

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,720
all righty well i think the first thing

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,280
we need to do so

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,160
b doug you've done a lot of work on um

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
git twitch

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
since the last time we had a session

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,120
like this

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,320
and so i was like well i obviously

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,960
coined the repo

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,720
last time or i fought the repo so if i

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
go to mine

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,120
i reckon mine is going to be quite a lot

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
of commits behind yours

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,960
so that's probably the first thing we

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,000
need to do is get yours here we go

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,320
so here's my fork um

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
this branch is nine commits head and

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,039
four commits behind

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,080
so i think that's the first thing we

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,759
need to fix others yeah yeah i think

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
so this is actually i was in a twitter

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
conversation uh with someone on twitter

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
about the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,479
this practice of updating your forks and

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
keeping them up to date so there's some

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,000
things that i

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
honestly i don't know if we are going to

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,280
come into some problems

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
um because i think were you working on

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
the main branch or did you create a new

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,960
branch for

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,680
her uh like i created a branch

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,680
okay so that that will be helpful um so

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
if your main branch has not

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,960
actually been touched uh this will make

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,960
the process much easier

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,479
uh if we did put some commits onto the

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
main branch uh this

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
will be challenging we might have to

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
we've done a couple

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,880
we've done nine commits ahead and four

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,319
commits behind

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
yeah and i think that the couple that we

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
actually did actually it might be

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
fun to actually talk through how to

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
clean this uh in the git history as well

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
so

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,800
um why don't we go ahead and do that uh

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
do you want to open a

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
i mean your choice code space you can do

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,360
this locally

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,520
and then while you're doing that i need

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
to switch headphones because i

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,919
got the noise that my headphones will be

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,400
uh dying soon oh no

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,560
that the noise that's not good all right

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
so the first thing we need to do is find

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,759
it

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,639
locally first uh do you wanna do this

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,639
through the terminal

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,960
oh sorry just just finally switched to

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
the new headphones

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,479
they're saying do we wanna do this

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
through the terminal

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
yeah we're gonna need a terminal uh i

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
think the cleanest way

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
now you might you might have a better

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
way through

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,000
desktop i know i talk about this all the

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
time i don't use github desktop so i

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
don't have the

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
the intuitiveness to be able to do this

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
locally in desktop but

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,199
for it looks like uh someone's saying

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
that my mic could be turned up

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,319
okay let's turn b doggy up wrong

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
there we go okay it's always hard to

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,120
tell when i don't have like

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
um like the output it's annoying set up

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,080
my one drive i don't want one drive

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
one drive has been very very mean to me

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
lately

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,080
yeah so daryl duck kind of

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
is mentioning the solution that i like

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,000
doing which is rebasing

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,120
um but um we're we're fine to uh

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
try whichever way you would like to um

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
so right now you just have to be on a

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,000
main branch uh and you want to pull the

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,639
latest from the main branch

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
but the the trick is at the moment we've

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,000
got two different versions we've got the

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
upstream which is mine

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,520
um so that's the buggy slice get twitch

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,599
and then we've got the

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,759
fork which is mish manor slash get

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,599
twitch uh so

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
we we need to actually make sure we're

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,520
pulling from

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
the upstream onto the main branch and

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
that's something that i don't unders i

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
don't quite have

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
in my github desktop knowledge uh but i

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,959
could do this

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,560
like a wizard on the terminal no so

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,719
we're looking at desktop at the moment

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
we can see all the things that have hap

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,200
changes so the greens obviously

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,399
additions and the writer's deletions

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
so now we can see like these ones are

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
mine it's a little

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
image here of me so they're my additions

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
and deletions and then we've got

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,120
brian's here as well b doggies so that

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,720
looks like he fixed up a few typos

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,839
and a few things so if we have a look

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,080
at the actual changes it says no local

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,959
changes

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
um so this is gonna be interesting to

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,040
see what

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,560
i'm i'm just it's a small bush yes

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,560
we're both little at the moment

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,600
um yeah so so let's do this um

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,880
since you have your your local repo uh

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
do you mind opening up a

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,519
terminal yeah uh and then typing the the

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,200
command get remote dash v

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,800
that's right uh i just want to see um

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
what sort of remotes we have available

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,600
to us it looks like we're not in the

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,120
repo yep um

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,160
do we want our get twitch actually

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,880
reaper or

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,560
no sorry we just want to get twitch now

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
we can do it and don't forget if you

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
press up tab on the keyboard and get

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
back to your last command

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,959
there we go yeah that's what we're

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,120
talking about so we've got two origins

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,440
and two upstreams

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,399
yep yep and technically they're both

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
it's one and one

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,600
um one's uh for fetching

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,959
um yeah yep so what we want to do is we

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,720
don't actually

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:23,440
get um get pool

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:27,279
sorry get fetch upstream me

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,800
get fetch upstream main

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,320
yes uh okay

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
all right yeah so that just makes the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
insurance that we have the connection so

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,920
we can do get

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,920
pull up screen main

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,240
uh okay there we go we got something

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,680
automatic merge failed

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,200
fix yeah and then commit the result

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
yeah so this is where we'll we'll need

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
to um get the latest and greatest in

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
sync and

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
what happens is uh and i guess what

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,040
happened in here and i didn't catch you

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
when we were doing this

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
uh is we want to actually create a new

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,079
branch every time we make changes

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
so that we always have a very consistent

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,200
and clean history

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,600
um so to be quite honest what i normally

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
do

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
in this situation is i always grab the

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,920
latest and greatest

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,120
of from the uh from the upstream

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,120
um mainly because i i'm

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
kind of a stickler in the history and

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
always want to make sure that

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
the commits that you're going to be

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
pushing back into the project are going

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,399
to be commits that are consistent with

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,800
what everybody else is because

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,560
uh we got super lucky and we we got what

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
20 stars last week and we got a couple

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
forks

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,880
so everybody's going to have the same

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
copy that i have um so we we're probably

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,720
going to eat and

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
um unfortunately we're probably going to

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
have to

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,320
rm-rf the your your project

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
yeah oh yeah daryl's like this because

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399
mitch writes and read me files

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,720
well there's b-doggy also updated the

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,320
readme files obviously yeah

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,600
in the and that's fair to to also

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
mention too like we

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
we did a lot of readme updates because

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
of my

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,639
uh unfortunate not having good

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
standards and practices for uh teaching

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,880
you

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,120
how to do this during the readme so

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,120
there's some clear clearly missing

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
uh components and as we were discovering

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
this so

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
luckily everybody who missed last week

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
now gets a nice clean

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,360
step five step process to you set up

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,880
their own git twitch

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,880
okay so what do i do

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,560
so uh we can if you wanted to merge

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,320
conference uh comforts

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,120
if you want to do the merge conflicts

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,000
here uh we can address those now

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,399
if you'd like so let's conflict and read

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,720
me

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,160
is the main thing that says yeah i think

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
that's pretty much the only conflict to

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,800
be quite honest good

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,079
yeah so uh if you wanted to sorry if you

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
want to open up the desktop

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,519
uh you could actually just open up the

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,079
readme file uh and then take a look at

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
that

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
so actually it's telling me there's

00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,800
conflicts sorry

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:03,920
um resolve conflicts for emerging domain

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,880
okay now what do we do yeah so

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
with that uh we should be able to back

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,839
out of this

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
and resolve those conflicts uh similar

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
to the way we do it it's in the

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,760
desktop ui or sorry the github.com

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,880
ui uh resolve using theirs which is um

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,079
is that what that said it was actually

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,600
kind of small for me so i don't know if

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,560
that's what

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,880
um it said on the screen uh i didn't

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
write it

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,440
all right you just said back out of it

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
this is true but i'm um daryl duck is

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,279
actually

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,320
like coming with the the he is pretty

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,920
good

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,079
yeah he's got the good feedback too as

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,040
well so he's seeing like the nice high

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,480
high value output um but it's it's fine

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
because uh we can actually just look at

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
the changes itself

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
um so i think the majority of the

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,440
changes um

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
you probably want to keep mine over

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
yours yeah so mainly because

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
because i've never actually done

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,440
conflict resolution before this is

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,600
actually really cool

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
so if i click oh you haven't no so if i

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,320
click view conflicts

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,079
this is what we saw yeah and uh

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
you'll have to explain the for whatever

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,360
reason the the font that i'm getting is

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,880
is not as high

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,519
output hopefully this won't mess up my

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
uh

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,279
my video to you but i'm going to open up

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,040
the stream so i can see

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,040
um what everybody else is seeing

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
that makes things a little bit easier

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,880
okay yeah for whatever

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
whatever reason what i'm getting from

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
you looks kind of like a potato

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,880
uh so zooming in i'm not sure if

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,920
actually okay so this is

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,160
better or worse here we go toggle

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,959
developers

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
you guys are funny so i'm just stuck on

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,320
here like

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,120
there's a conflict okay now how do we

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,560
fix this conflict

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
we can zoom in even more it's just like

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
yeah

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,320
200 this is where you want to fix the

00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
conflict so

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
um this is going to be the same thing if

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
we open up an editor or anything like

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
that

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,000
um so we see what a head those little

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,959
arrows

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
which ones these uh so you have the um

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
they're like little carrots and then

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
there's a

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,480
capital h-e-a-d on line 10.

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
yeah yeah yeah so that's going to be the

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
start of

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,920
some changes and then if you scroll down

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,760
to the the next set of arrows

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,959
this is going to be a block of changes

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,160
that i have

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,079
okay and then the next section of the

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,600
arrows pointing the other direction

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
these are gonna be the changes that you

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,600
have okay

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
so the easiest thing to do is probably

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,639
just go ahead and obliterate yours

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,399
so everything from yeah because i

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
mean can i just like get my magic wand

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,959
and just obliterate

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,120
like um or

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,160
highlighting and deleting uh so mine 20

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
to 10.

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
um i don't think you can do that in here

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,399
this is not an editor

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,279
so oh this is an adder yeah i guess

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
that's not like we said if we click this

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,759
and then we

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,880
open it in open

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
you could open an atom or vs code or i

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,680
don't know why it didn't give me the

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,839
option to open in vs code that's okay

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,199
we're hearing out of now

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
okay we're going to use we're going to

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,759
use we're going to use all the browsers

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,480
or sorry

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
all the id's today it is everything okay

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
so

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,399
obliterate so yeah so from line

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,560
20 i think it was 20. is that what we

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,079
discovered 20 to 17. oh it's actually

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,320
got little things what does this mean

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,680
so i can click use mine or yours so

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,279
which one do i want to use

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,519
oh so we want to use yours as

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,560
we can use our changes or their changes

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,639
so we're going to use

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
me as in their channel okay their

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,279
changes

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,959
oh this is so cool okay

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,600
so this is new to me i have not seen

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,600
that uh interaction before

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,040
i chose the blue one of course i chose

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
the blue one yeah

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,079
that was good okay so now we're done now

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
we save it i'm guessing

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
okay well back in my day when i used to

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
use editors

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,920
um it was never that easy so you you

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,120
definitely lucked that on this one i

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,720
don't know i thought um

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,400
so for everyone who doesn't know like

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
obviously create space is a new thing

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
too

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,400
and our boss martin's always like you

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,679
kids these days you have no idea how

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,120
easy you've got it

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,079
back in my day we had to like wait like

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,439
500 years to get a dev machine that

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,400
works and now you're opening up for code

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,600
space and it takes 10 seconds i'm like

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,280
it is remarkable um how advanced the

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,120
developer tool space has been and like

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,240
even in the last five years um

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,720
i think like vs code is really um well

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
not like there's jet brains there's vs

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
code

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,840
atom is what we just saw sublime i was

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,360
actually originally a sublime user

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
uh so that's where i got i sort of cut

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,720
my teeth on developer

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,360
um tools but um or ids rather

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,200
but i'm actually a vim user so when like

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,400
we see all those like buttons and bells

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
and whistles like i don't have any of

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
that

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,160
in my editor uh because i just i choose

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,480
to do the hard

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,120
the hard way i don't you kids and your

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,679
campaign boys your ideas and your cloud

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,600
machine

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:13,200
thingies yeah and all right

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,039
we have so much fun you got fugitive

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,280
yes we did all right so if we go back

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,120
into this so it looks like we've still

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,480
got some

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,000
green and red things

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,520
i'm just gonna call it green so it

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,960
doesn't look like it's picked up all the

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,080
changes looks like i can only pick up

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,360
one of them

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,120
which is this one up here yep so yeah i

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,320
think that was the one button we

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,760
we did and i think um i'm not sure

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,440
the way it's set up if we go to uh look

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
at what the rest of the history does it

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
lists anything

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,400
else that has conflicts or is this is it

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,080
i think that was the only so okay i'm

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,559
slightly confused on the green and the

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
red versus the conflicts

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
yeah so the conflicts are going to be

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,360
where the like those those carrots or

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,280
arrows i honestly don't know what

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,559
they're why are they good

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,679
carrots because they uh

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,120
i don't know why they're called carrots

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,480
if anybody knows the answer why these

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,880
things are called carrots

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,160
uh these little mouths uh let me know if

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,559
they're even called that but

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
if they're none of those we're good okay

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,640
cool so it looks like that was the only

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,000
one so i saved this file

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,320
and then then what

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
it doesn't look like it doesn't look

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,120
like it's oh view conflicts no comp now

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,120
i can commit merge right

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,160
yes this is so easy it does have to stop

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,880
well yeah yeah easy in in

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,320
air quotes well yeah easy and eager yes

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,480
but i mean like

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
it's showing you a lot of like i think

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,799
most of the ways i've found

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,919
how to do stuff is like like right now

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
it's like good

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,039
there's a blue button that says would

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,000
you like to push to origin it's like

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,039
cool like it's

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,280
it's kind of guiding you in the ways um

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
that you kind of need to go the other

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,559
thing that's what i like about this

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,240
stuff is like oh look it's now done

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,400
now there's no other big blue button so

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,880
it's like oh cool it must be okay

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
right yeah and and daryl points it out

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,840
it's always not that easy i mean we did

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,360
edit some markdown uh normally when it

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,360
comes to code trying to figure out what

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,840
the changes are and not breaking changes

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,200
this is why it's nice to have test in an

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
environment because if you do break

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
stuff your

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,080
your team will find it pretty easily um

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
because the test will or the build will

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,400
fail

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,679
um but yeah editing markdown

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,240
merge conflicts is going to be like

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,840
wildly different than um

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,799
editing uh like walls of code and text

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,799
and stuff like that

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,000
or unless the conflict is in the test

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,679
apparently

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,720
well if that's the case like just go

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,799
ahead and just say walk away

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,520
i'm just kidding the table off you go

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,799
alrighty okay so we've merged all the we

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,360
fixed up all the conflicts

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,080
there's no more local changes now yeah

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
and

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
i think a good thing to point out too as

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,120
well because you push that back up to

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
the

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,520
your fork yeah you've actually already

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,080
had a pr open

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,679
um so if you wanted to go to github.com

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,840
and look at that pr

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,320
i'll put requests oh look at this too

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,640
now what happens it's probably gonna oh

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,320
no no conflicts

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
gotta resolve these comments

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,280
so many conflicts um

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
so do you sorry do you have conflicts in

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
your pr

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,600
doesn't look like it says this branch

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,440
has no conflicts of the brace branch

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
gotcha yeah so i'm actually going to use

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,760
a a quick

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,080
little tool that um

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,159
that i will sorry there's a there's a

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,320
tool called and i know you're called

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,919
what's the tool i think i should know

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,039
this because i work at github and this

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,799
is my job

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,520
um but when you suggested changes sorry

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,000
suggested changes yeah so i'm actually

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,559
gonna do

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,760
um i'm at a single line comment for some

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,440
suggested changes

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,559
uh which you'll probably see um and

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,640
there's going to be some changes because

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,679
you have hard-coded some of the code

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
from

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,360
um like mitch manners i probably don't

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,640
want everybody to clone this and get

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
miss maynard so

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
um for the state uh in case people do

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
want to fork this and they're confused

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159
on who miss manners is

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
uh i'm switching that back to uh b-duggy

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
nice um but

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,720
but everything else i think will keep as

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
is because i think

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
those are all great changes that we

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
actually got uh during the stream last

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
time

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,559
so i can resolve the conversation is

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,799
that what

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,280
actually if you go to because i did

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,440
suggested changes i suggested

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,720
directly the pr that you could actually

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
change this from mitch manners to b

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,799
dougie

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,520
uh you can go to that drop down where it

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,480
says commit

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,720
yeah and then that's actually going to

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,840
create a commit directly on the repo

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,480
or sorry on the your branch

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,679
so i can just click commit now yep and

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,159
it's just going to update the uh the

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,440
file

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,080
to back to my name okay yeah and i got

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
we got one oh wow uh yeah i wanted to do

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
that because

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,720
i i figured maybe somebody didn't know

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,799
that that existed so

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,320
uh definitely watch the changelogs uh

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,280
the changelog videos that michelle does

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
on youtube

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,120
but also come to these streams and you

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,679
will be learned we will learn

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,600
you will be learned is that you'll be

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,720
learning

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,720
yeah you'll be learned it dude

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,360
yeah so i'm gonna go ahead and merge

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
that pr because i think it's good i

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,080
actually reviewed it earlier

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,240
um okay but wanted to save it

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,799
save it for the uh all the content on

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,919
stream so i'm gonna merge this into

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,280
now the one thing i'm gonna do is i'm

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,360
gonna squash and merge because you've

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,559
got a lot of commits that um

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,240
that are uh quite different but i'm

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,360
gonna call these um

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
michelle streaming updates um

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,400
and this is something that not a lot of

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,840
people have a lot of strong opinions

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
about i'm just kidding developers have

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,880
opinions

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,799
um the difference between squashing

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,679
emerge and merge commits

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
and rebasin merging actually if you're

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
in the chat what's your

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,360
preference is it rebase is it squashing

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
is it merge commits

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,480
the people actually don't know about

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
what each of those things mean

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
do you want to explain a real quick high

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,120
level yes

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,120
so while people are deciding which ones

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,640
they liked uh merge commits i'll start

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,720
with that one because it's top

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,320
uh in the drop down uh so me as a

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
maintainer what i'm doing is i i can do

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,520
a merge commit

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
and that's going to create a commit uh

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,640
that's going to have say

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,840
basically michelle streaming update

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,159
readme.md

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
uh because i just renamed it just now

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
that is going to add a commit and then

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,039
it's going to take your eight commits

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
actually at this point it's 11 commits

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,960
uh and it's going to shove those into

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,720
the main so i'm going to have now nine

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
commits and then this merge commit that

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,320
i can't do anything with

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,679
i personally don't like that i'm sorry

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
i'm gonna tell you my

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,720
opinions because i'm talking no i'm just

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,279
kidding

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,799
no but um i i don't like the merchant

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,320
commits because they're very challenging

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,120
to work with if you have to revert

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,840
history

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,120
um so i always avoid those the other two

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,279
options is rebase

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
which rebase will take those 11 commits

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,799
and and

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
incept them directly into the history

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,799
the way and makes it

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,520
fit perfect perfectly that's also

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,440
challenging

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,440
and something that has a caveat with

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,039
because if you want to revert back to

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
like the last three commits the last two

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,320
commits can be two of mine

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,039
and one of yours or five of yours and

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,039
one of mine it won't be as clean

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,640
uh and then so what i would normally do

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,279
for prs because i force

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,799
everybody to do prs for all my projects

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,880
even open source ones

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,960
and i do this myself is i squash and

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,600
merge so not only do i get one merge

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,159
commit

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,679
i get only one commit from michelle's

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,039
changes so i'm gonna do that

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,480
and that's my preference i am not right

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,159
by all means like this is not the best

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,559
way to do everything

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,520
but after the years of programming that

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
i've done

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,480
i've just discovered that this is the

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,600
the easiest way for me to sort of manage

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,880
projects in the open in open source so

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,720
if i look at mine mine says vdog emerged

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
11 commits is that what that means so

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,760
you've squashed all those 11 commits

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,520
into one

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,039
yes and if you go to the actual upstream

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,279
so if you go to bw

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,600
get twitch you can actually look at the

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,000
history and you'll see

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
uh a nice beautiful single commit it's

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
got both of our heads on it

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,880
um so it's that last comm if you go to

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
the uh

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,760
on this one here uh that's actually

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
gonna open up the pr

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
actually no that will work actually you

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,000
can click that commit sorry

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,840
okay all right that's it and then so

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,799
these are all your commit squash into

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,279
one

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,120
right right that makes sense yep and the

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
nice thing about this it also gives us a

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,080
nice little link

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,279
to the pr so if you went to that number

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,799
four up on the top

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,520
of the screen uh keep going at the top

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,840
right at the top all that one yeah yeah

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,600
so that takes us to the original pr

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,520
and this is this is nice because it

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,480
gives you a nice continuous

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
context of what is actually happening

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,000
and like

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,200
um license i can't pronounce your your

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,120
name but um

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
the they're mentioning about uh wasan

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,279
actually maybe

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,320
lisandro sorry i'm just figuring a name

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
on the fly uh

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,919
rebasing does make the history really

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,440
clean and clear and there are certain

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,480
projects that i've talked to

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,400
um as a github open source projects that

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,919
love the rebase because you do have a

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,320
consistent history and as long as the

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,480
whole

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,919
team and contributors are very clear

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,559
about how they

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,399
they write their commits in the history

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,039
so like even like your commits like fix

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,080
encryption remove flex remove flex fix

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,279
css

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,600
like there's a couple of fixed css

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,480
those could be confusing to manage if

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,799
you have

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,000
wildly different names so what the best

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,200
thing to do is probably have a

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
contributing md

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,399
and have context there of how you expect

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,000
your contributors

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,399
and your team members to write their

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,760
commit messages and whether you prefer

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,159
rebasing or squashing because if you do

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,520
want to

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,919
if you do one of each it's just going to

00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,960
be wildly hard to manage

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,480
um so take one and stick with it

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,120
that's usually the best the best use

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
case yeah so i've been on teams that

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,559
have done

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,840
all all of the above and um for all

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,520
different types of reasons

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,120
and usually it you just do the thing

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,600
that the the person has been there the

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
longest

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,000
has decided or has still around to

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,120
convince the rest of the team to do i

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,279
like that but

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,120
to be quite honest there are so many

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:26,399
github integrations like github apps

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,520
as well as actions that can enforce uh

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,159
and lynch your commits

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,600
as well so at the end of the day like

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,039
having this conversation is probably

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,320
should be a done conversation you should

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,399
just install a github

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,000
repo integration and then you're you're

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,159
convinced that this is now

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,679
the way to go moving forward and some of

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
the popular ones are like semantic

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
release

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,760
um is one of them uh it's a github

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,039
project

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,240
that enforces the the uh pr structure so

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
that way the commits

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
show up really nice in your sort of

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,799
release documentation

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,520
sounds good and we've got someone since

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,080
there's um they found rebase tougher

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,799
when bisecting regressions

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,120
and then what do you do when you need to

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,799
remove a commit that was squashed

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,799
after the pr was closed

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
is that a is that one of those flip the

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
table runaway

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
situation yeah yeah so the the hope is

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,279
that you can re

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,240
you can revert an entire pr merge uh so

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,760
if you cut a release

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,080
the hope is that you can actually revert

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,840
back uh and make that not as

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
a pain because you only have to revert

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
one commit if you want to revert one

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,600
commit

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,559
that was squashed a bunch of like ten

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,000
different commits

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,520
i would say um there's like no judgment

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
here but like i think there might be a

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,600
code smell

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
of like maybe the best practices that

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,640
you're using for your team

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
perhaps there's like some sort of

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,320
linting or integration or

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,520
qa testing that can prevent that in the

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,200
future uh

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
because like if you're if you're fixing

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,080
things in production all the time

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,480
um it's probably not going to be a

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,760
nice ergonomic coding experience moving

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,679
forward so

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,799
i would i would recommend figure how to

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,039
make that more ergonomic

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,840
and easier to work with um so that way

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,919
you don't have to do that

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,200
ever i like it

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,120
basically avoid this situation

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,559
yeah i mean it's something that it's a

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
learned experience too as well which

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,240
like why

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,440
folks um why you sometimes you just have

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,520
to defer the people who've been on the

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,600
team the longest because they've seen

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,279
like i've been in the in the room where

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,320
like someone mentioned bisecting

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,080
uh where someone deleted like a wall of

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,000
code like that was actually legitimate

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,360
needed to be in

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,880
in the um the project and like everybody

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,559
moves like back in the day when we're

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,159
all in the office everybody goes to

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
the one person's desk they pull out the

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,679
get bisect they start writing down on

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
the whiteboard like here's the commit of

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
this happening here's a commitment to

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,159
that happening

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
like and you get like the um it's like

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,520
that one meme

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,200
of charlie day uh from always sunny in

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,919
philadelphia where he has like

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,440
the red strings between the pictures and

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,960
like it's just him like

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,039
okay this is what happened like the the

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,320
the crazed dev just trying to figure out

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,840
you know okay

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,399
it was this commit if we go down to this

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,840
commit we can squash here and yeah so

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,720
we don't want to get to that situation

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,919
so lint integration qa testing

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,080
all the sort of um agile methodology uh

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,760
recommend checking out that stuff out

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,399
too as well

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,320
sounds good all right so we squashed and

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,440
merged all my stuff

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,640
now what do we do next yeah so now we

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,519
we have a a clean history uh we can

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,480
actually

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,640
uh you want to actually pull go back to

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,480
here we can pull it now right

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,480
yeah and because our main branch mit um

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,840
uh a merged commit which has been

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,720
rebased you want to pull from the

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,120
upstream again

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,000
no it still says fix conflicts and then

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,480
commit the result

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,440
does it really interesting ah that's

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,600
weird

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,760
uh it's got more things in it though so

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,760
remunerating objects counting objects

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,480
totals seven

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,799
were they're both on the main branches

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,880
and

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,039
there's a merge conflict in

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,480
gift.js yeah and that's the merge

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,000
conflict that we just fixed so i think

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,080
you're gonna

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,039
i think what you probably want to do is

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,080
probably start

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,279
again with a full uh a fresh pool uh

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,159
because we're probably getting some like

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,880
really weird

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,440
get history issues because the fix you

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,679
fix

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,200
was a fix that was already on main

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,799
that's now in maine

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
we can also do some other like force

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,360
pulling where it actually rewrites your

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,679
history for you

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,399
oh you know what actually what's better

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,000
did you just delete that

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,919
oh we could actually delete the main

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,919
branch and fetch the main branch again

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,279
and then we'll be back to square how do

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,399
we do that

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,360
um so if you want to check out um any

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,960
other branch just

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,880
check out um a new branch called

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,640
deleted start again is a is definitely

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,760
an approach

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:06,080
thing what do we call live branch

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,519
uh this called this new branch um test

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,880
i think it's fine but you'll need to do

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,480
dash b so check out dashb

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,159
or yeah do check out dashb

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,760
uh there's a branch command but i forget

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,519
what it is like that and then

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,480
and then test no the brush there

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,120
exists what oh because i just created it

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,840
above

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,799
oh you just created a so you created the

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,880
empty branch

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,919
this oh no no you're good yeah yeah i

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,000
just created it there

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,840
so yeah it's there's two ways to get

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
check out b test or get branch test

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,840
so actually we should explain this real

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,960
quick get branch test created a branch

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,720
called test

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
but you didn't check out into it so

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,399
you're still working so now we need to

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,519
go

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,559
get check out check out

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,600
tests which means it should switch what

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,640
you need to

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,679
resolve your current index first

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,799
so this is this is weird we're going to

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,080
spend a lot of time again

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,960
uh if you do just do get clean get space

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,000
clean

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,119
dash f dash d and what this is going to

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,040
do is just basically

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,480
clean up everything that we did to get

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,839
the merge conflict

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,639
and now you can check out test so this

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,599
is a

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,599
force and delete with

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,440
needs merge i don't get it

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,839
all right now let's try get checkout

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,839
period

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,240
unmerged oh get merge abort okay

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,240
so

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,359
thanks thank you chatters

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,440
there we go i think we're good so now we

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,520
can check out the branch right

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,720
yes and there's you could also if this

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,720
is something finally

00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:01,040
okay so also um uh

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,079
lisandro uh lisandro um

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
i don't know if i'm supposed to say that

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,880
right apologies but uh you could also do

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,480
force

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
yeah uh which would have just forced us

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,880
onto that branch so now we're on that

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,400
branch

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,119
yeah so now we want to we want to do get

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,599
um branch dash capital d

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,040
what is that and it's going to delete

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,240
and then type in main

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,079
uh we're just going to delete the main

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,040
branch oh okay so

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,320
a big d is delete the main branch it's

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,800
delete but also

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,640
don't question me so if you just

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,480
lowercase question maybe

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,599
yes so lowercase d says deleted main

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
branch there we go

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,880
yeah uh but just real quick the

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
lowercase d would

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,320
it would have been like are you so sure

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,280
capital is like no i'm serious about

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,440
this i'm serious

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,680
okay cool okay so we've delivered the

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:58,320
name branch now what do we want to do

00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:00,640
so now we can do type in git fetch

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,720
sorry get fetch upstream yeah i was like

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,160
do you want to get the out stream

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
yeah good fetch is going to grab your

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,440
origin yeah i believe

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,440
so it looks up with and now you should

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
be able to get check out maine

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,960
and what fetch upstream does is this

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,560
actually fetches all the uh the content

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,720
but stores it in

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
memory and what is this you have a

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,440
remote tracking

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
origin if you'd like to always have

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,880
uh so this is basically if you'd like to

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,200
make origin your default

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,520
okay um to check out a remote branch

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,920
you can do by fully qualifying the name

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,359
the track option

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:43,119
okay so you could have did get checkout

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,160
upstream main because it matched

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,240
two remote tracking branches

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,920
yeah so did this fail or did it actually

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,920
go are we on the main branch it says

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,400
fatal

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,839
okay so we should actually get check out

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,680
um

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,760
upstream oh yeah because

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,680
by the sounds of it we were checking out

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,240
the

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,880
main branch locally but we want to check

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,960
out the upstream right

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,960
yes no it doesn't match any files

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,880
get cracking ads come up

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,200
[Laughter]

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,800
okay well let's just do this let's just

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,560
go ahead and go back to the deleting

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,480
strategy that daryl had earlier and

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,960
we'll start from there uh because we can

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,800
we can actually delete and then

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,040
uh move forward from there so the way i

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,079
did it last on tuesday was

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,720
if you go to here get

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:45,200
twitch and you grab the

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:49,839
um the code here

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,839
uh the drop down that's actually the

00:37:53,150 --> 00:38:00,480
[Applause]

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,480
it still says it's invalid

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
that's really weird

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,800
yeah i think i think we'll be best to uh

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,920
we could probably so we won't lose any

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,280
context if we

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
and this is what i've always tried to

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,240
avoid this uh is actually deleting the

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,160
fork

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,920
uh because all the history and your your

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
thoughts and process are still there and

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,520
the fork

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,400
um but i'm not quite understanding why

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,920
the

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,240
the the branch itself is not

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,839
not liking what we're doing that's

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,200
that's the that's the challenge that i'm

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,320
having but i think it's because we have

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,040
the two mains

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,599
and git is having trouble understanding

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,599
why

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,720
we want to check out main from saying

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,640
we've got

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:49,440
multiple remote tracking branches

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,079
yes and we do actually because we have

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,480
upstream

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,920
and then we have origin oh okay

00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,520
right that's the problem isn't it yeah

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,720
yeah so i think the the best way to go

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,960
about this

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,000
is type a bunch of get commands and then

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,440
we can uh

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,960
sometimes you just have to start digging

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,640
a new hole instead of digging the one

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,160
you're in too deep yeah

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,760
daryl is like he's he's pointing us to

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,320
deleting the repo yeah

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,920
exactly so let's let's let's go ahead

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,560
and this uh appeased arrow and then we

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,599
can start

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,200
creating some integrations okay

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,560
so just delete this entire folder

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,480
everything's from from your local um

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,760
terminal or or wherever you want to

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,200
choose to delete it you can do it in

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,520
your folder structure as well just

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,480
delete it from the folder usually okay

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,760
so back out

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,880
of it we're deleting people recycling

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
three boom

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,680
yeah so we could back out of this folder

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,440
structure um

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,760
what i also recommend to as well is

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,359
deleting the the fork itself

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
uh and then reforking so that way you

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,240
have a fresh fork so

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,520
delete the fork from my github uh yeah

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,520
github.com

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,040
yeah so let's go there and this is like

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,079
this is not really the best practice

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,079
this is something i was having a

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,599
conversation with on twitter

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,319
um that to keep your fork up to date

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,480
you can get in some pretty hairy messes

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,160
like we just gotten to

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,520
and like deleting the fork should not be

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,960
the solution but it's the solution most

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,000
people use

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,000
so if you go to your settings

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,920
of the mish banners fork this one here

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,520
says settings yep

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,119
and then scroll to the bottom and click

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,480
the big red button oh we're just gonna

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,640
delete it okay

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,520
yeah yeah there's not really any magic

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,920
to this uh

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,280
it's just the sometimes when your

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,839
history just gets a little messed up you

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,640
just gotta start from scratch

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,079
yeah i managed to do it on tuesday we um

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,079
get what we found i said

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,560
um have to choose my password again all

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,000
right we'll put this back to here so

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,440
people don't see

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,839
all my passwords and fun things um

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,000
but yeah i managed to do it on tuesday

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,720
because there was a

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,200
file i had locally that was

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,400
759 commits behind the main

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,920
but i think there was there was no um

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,680
there's no conflict so i was able to

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
just to pull up stream and we use

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,000
that um dot git um

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,880
why did it mess up because i'm terrible

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,400
this

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,680
um i mean yeah for in in in fairness it

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,599
it messed up because we were

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,720
applying changes last week directly to

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,839
the main branch

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,359
not actually thinking yeah actually that

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,319
would have made more sense because when

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,640
i did it

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,560
um i wasn't making changes to the main

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,560
branch so we did get

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,599
um get remote add up stream

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,839
and then we added that dot git like

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,520
url link and then it worked and then you

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,560
pull it in and then

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,599
we pushed it back and it worked yeah and

00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,200
it was um

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,720
but because we didn't make changes to

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,200
the main branch

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,640
yeah and i think what the the value here

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,640
to kind of learn from too as well is

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,079
like as a contributor to an open source

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,200
project you never want to use the

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,560
default branch

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,319
uh even though it's the easiest thing to

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,079
do if you ever want to

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,680
if you ever ever want to contribute

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,319
again you're always going to be in a

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,000
really weird spot that we got into

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,319
so in the future we're always creating a

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,240
new branch and my best practice and what

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,400
i recommend most of my projects

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,359
is create a branch describing the change

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,760
you want to make

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,720
so today we could actually create a new

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,560
branch from the

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,240
a new fork and call it um updated style

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,839
and then at that point we can update the

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,000
style and focus on that and then once

00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,359
we've completed that we'll do a pr

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,440
and then we can move on to the next

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,560
feature okay let's do that then

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,839
so we're back here so i fork it again

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,480
yep so we create a new one

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,000
and then so we've got a branch so we're

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,040
going to add a new branch don't we oh

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,040
it's got our gifts there

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,240
um so we're gonna call this style

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,240
changes are we

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,400
yep so we're gonna create the branch

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,800
cool done we got a branch

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,240
excellent and then we have some setup

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,079
that we need to do too as well so i

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,760
don't know if you still have a smee

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,359
site up and running um you probably have

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,359
you should have a the thing is we had to

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,599
click we had to delete the branch

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,800
uh sorry the fork itself uh so you

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,839
probably have to create a new smee

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,720
client which is probably good

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,319
updates are sorry good context for folks

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,520
who weren't here last time

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:37,280
yeah um so do this on smooth channel

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,720
yep yeah and while you're doing that uh

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,160
all this exploit for folks you just

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
showed we're actually building a github

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,359
integration

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,359
into twitch the twitch stream that we

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,440
have going right now

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,800
so michelle is actually creating a sme

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
that i o

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
link smee is an internal tool that

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,960
github employees built

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,000
it's basically a web hook receiver or

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,400
aggregator

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,599
um so that's what that is and it's

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,800
probably why you haven't heard of it

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,880
because it's a tool that we use

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,160
internally that's open sourced

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,680
um yeah there's there's i was surprised

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,400
on how many open source projects github

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,920
has

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,240
that most people have probably never

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,560
heard of and i think that's just kind of

00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,960
how open source works even github has

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,960
projects

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,960
okay so in your newly forked repo create

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,359
a

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,160
hook that's right yep we went with the

00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,880
last time did we web hooks

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,400
yeah and then um you'll need to create a

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
web hook secret too as well

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,119
and that was yes we'll do this on off

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,000
screen otherwise people can randomly get

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,520
into my

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,960
things okay secret yeah you can add a

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,599
web hood secret and then go ahead and

00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
create that

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,359
and then the one thing else that you

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,760
want to um

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,200
keep in mind is you want to track stars

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,359
not all pushes

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,720
by default when you create a web hook on

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,200
github repos

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,560
it tracks all push pushes to the um or

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,880
commits to the

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,319
project and uh for the sake of not

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,599
having such a noisy

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,880
bot we're just gonna track stars okay

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,800
cool so we've done that um now if i go

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,640
back to here

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,680
select oh that's right we want to change

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,680
the stars didn't we

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,359
i think if i edit that yeah my secret is

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,480
shown so we just wanted to change the

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,240
stars didn't we

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,520
eyes it'll just be all over the place

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,040
um so not pushes stars

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,880
and don't forget to hit update that was

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,160
one thing we've got last time we updated

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,200
like the secret and then we forgot to

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,400
hit update which is

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,680
right down the bottom so smee handles

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,880
the web hook

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,440
um calls from twitch that's correct

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,400
yep it is yep yep and at this point we

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,079
wanted to

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,760
set this up locally so you'll probably

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,119
want to clone this locally

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,560
um into your your environment

00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,160
oh sorry one more there's one more thing

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,119
we actually got stuck on last week

00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,390
uh we want to switch that to json yes as

00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,560
well so whenever you get a chance

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,119
[Applause]

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,680
yeah so uh planner has a question about

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,200
our

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,680
aren't stars in the rest api and the

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,079
answer is yes but the rest api is not

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,920
live

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,240
and updated when you when you fetch it

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,359
so instead of creating a polling tool

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,480
uh of saying like github is an api

00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:21,440
api.github.com

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,000
this repo stars that's only going to

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,880
update

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
every time you hit the api github itself

00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,040
has a rate limit

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,160
of unauthenticated requests are like 40

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,680
per hour authenticated requests are i

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,520
think like a couple hundred

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,800
um so with the web hooks every time

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,520
there's a star we're going to be

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,680
notified

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,040
through this integration so that's

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,680
basically the

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,280
sort of uh yeah you probably i know i

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,240
kept i kept the explanation even though

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,920
you said you got it

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,920
uh but in case other people were not

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,599
informed i just kept going through

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,079
um yeah okay

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:56,720
so why you did that i coined the repo um

00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,760
don't forget

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,800
um repo clone is not a git commander to

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,480
github command so gh repo clone and then

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,119
obviously you don't need github.com

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,280
because

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,480
you're already on github um and then

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,920
just the path

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,680
of the repo you want to clone and then

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,359
that clones it into whatever this

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,920
directory you've put in here so that's

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:19,119
obviously where all my get initialized

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,319
um repos sit on my computer so they just

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,240
sit there

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,400
and then i just dropped it into desktop

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,040
so that when we make changes um

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,319
we can see them here and then we can

00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
push straight back

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,839
we're going to get rid of this yeah

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,599
accidentally and i i realized for the

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,280
sake of daryl who asked a question

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,160
earlier how we got so

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,200
messed up the cli actually does the

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,440
upstream for us

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,040
which in history uh when you do the git

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,359
clone from github

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,800
you don't get the upstream setup so you

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,079
would have to manually set up my

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,079
my upstream which is buggy

00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:57,680
fork local which is mish manor slash

00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,480
get twitch again we we um we

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,920
cut a little bit of your audio just then

00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,200
when you say we have to re

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
we have to set up yours oh yeah so

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,280
basically this

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,200
what i was getting at i dropped a link

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,160
to the cli in the chat because the cli

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,040
connects

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
the fork and the the main upstream so my

00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,079
project

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,599
and then michelle's fork of my project

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,880
are now connected to the same

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,040
clone because of the github right um

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,079
that's not normal um it just happens to

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,480
be a nice

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,760
uh syntactical sugar that has been added

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,599
to the cli tool

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,680
okay so there's anything else we need to

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,599
do to make sure that we're

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,160
on the correct or we need to actually

00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,359
switch to the correct branch don't we

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,359
yeah we'll want to switch to your new

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,680
branch which is style css

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:42,960
and then at that point we'll need to uh

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,240
do two things

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,480
we need to create an environment

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,520
variable of file

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,680
that includes your secret style

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,280
changes yeah so yeah we're going to

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,800
switch to the correct branch though

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,440
right

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,640
yep check out oh hey we're not on the

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,140
right thing we need to go

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:06,330
cd we need to go into all

00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,330
[Applause]

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,640
okay now on that one now we can go um

00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,000
[Music]

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,599
get check out style

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
changes that should switch to that

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,920
branch

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,559
branch just set up to track remote

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,599
branch

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,319
is that correct yes that is 100 correct

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,359
okay cool so

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,040
switch to our new branch and then it's

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,680
now set up to track changes

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,520
okay cool yep looking good so far okay

00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,760
looking good

00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,520
so now we want to actually set up the

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,640
environment so two things we want to set

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,640
up smee

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,839
uh but smee also needs to have a web

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,839
hook secret as well

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,559
okay so so you should be able to do this

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,240
uh the smee cli command

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,480
locally so you should have already

00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,040
already have that installed uh from last

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,880
week so smee dash you

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,160
also this is referencing the uh the

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,640
readme for folks you are

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,280
following along no option argument is

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,760
missing

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,319
oh we need that whole url don't we yes

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,160
yep

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,160
which you can copy from the um

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,640
it should just be the url above

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,920
or you have it saved in your web books

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,800
yeah there we go i was going to go to

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,319
the website but

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:29,599
say and that url

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:32,160
there we go so now

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,359
all right so leave that alone and then

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,480
create a new tab

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,200
in your terminal uh because now we have

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,599
smee running

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,720
uh the only other thing we can do is uh

00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,040
go into your

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,400
editor of your choice which i i'm i

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
don't know which one we're we're using

00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,160
at this point

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,000
we'll go vs code why not why not i mean

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,559
we haven't seen vs code yet so

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,680
this would be in this sport editor there

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,720
you go that's the last thing i was

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,079
working on how to view

00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,520
stl files in github

00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,119
weird flex but okay this is the last

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,280
thing i was doing

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,480
we did it on stream yesterday it was my

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,839
stream

00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,920
yeah sorry i was just i was just kidding

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,079
all right cool so we got our phone here

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,800
now yeah and are you able to

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,000
i don't know um uh part of your vs code

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,599
is actually cut off

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,599
for the viewer yeah we'll make a bit

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,119
the whole window a bit small funk there

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,559
we go

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,119
there we go and you have the emv that

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,160
example so last time what we did was we

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,720
copied that

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,839
example file that's right so we're gonna

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,040
go

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,960
copy paste and then we put our secret in

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,079
there so i'll do this part off screen if

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,920
you want to

00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,079
chat about whatever talk about yeah and

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,480
make sure you do it uh so make sure you

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,240
also

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,960
rename it to emv um as the name of the

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,040
file but

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,240
so we we went pretty quick because we

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,079
did do this last week

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,920
um but folks if you're just joining us

00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,400
we do have a repo which is

00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,599
vw get twitch uh this is our twitch

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,800
integration that we're gonna add

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,559
in a moment to to our twitch the actual

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,359
show we're on uh it's sort of like

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,960
learning how to

00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,720
fly a plane while building it at the

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,640
same time um

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,400
we're gonna share that in a second uh

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,160
but the the trick of this is that we're

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,280
watching stars we set up our web hooks

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,280
we set up our smee

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,480
to actually receive the web hooks and

00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,960
then we're going to set up a local

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,680
server

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,240
on localhost 3000 i think is the default

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,839
one

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,440
and we're going to add that to obs and

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,680
then every time you star

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
the git twitch repo then we're going to

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,400
have some sort of integration happen

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,319
uh on the screen or in our ears if we

00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,200
still have the flex command going

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:40,000
yeah all right so we just call this

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,000
whatever right

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,880
rename we can just rename that anything

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:49,040
but it's got to be dot env right

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,040
uh it should just be emv

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,760
and uh the question that just came in do

00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,079
you guys work at uh

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,520
github and the answer is yes we actually

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,040
both work at github

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,599
um i work as a developer advocate on

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,200
i was going to say on this the some team

00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,920
but like

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,599
deveral team yeah most most developer

00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,079
advocates kind of have like a certain

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,000
segment of what they work on like i talk

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,800
about github and michelle also talks

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,880
about github

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,079
on the developer relations team it's

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,000
pretty fun

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,280
good gig yeah we're both on the same

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,720
team which is really fun

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,319
so that's all we get to do really cool

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,240
stuff like this all the time

00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,240
okay so we just do our jobs on the

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,760
internet no how good is it i mean

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,960
usually we do this kind of stuff in

00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,079
person right

00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:38,079
come along and have a workshop with us

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:41,359
yay um oh sorry code

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:44,960
you um you got you got dolly

00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:47,280
let me let me fix that um unban you

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,240
yeah so smee looks exactly what you've

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,599
been looking for

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,400
so happy yay um so yeah we've um

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,720
removed urls in the chat because you

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,599
know

00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,640
people like to post some really weird

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,280
urls so

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,359
yeah sometimes spam is a real thing

00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,440
blank abandonment was really easy

00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,760
okay so we've done that we've created

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,839
the emv file we've put our webhook

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:14,160
um secret in there uh what do we do now

00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,359
uh so now we gotta run the server uh at

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,400
this point the one other thing that

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,680
we'll probably need to check because i

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,960
know we got an error of this last time

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,000
is go to the public in

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,119
index.html um

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,280
the and sorry it wasn't the index.html

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,480
there should be oh yeah so line 14. it

00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,800
looks good

00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,200
um yeah so that's right that was my

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:37,520
change i wrote that in there

00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,280
changed wss if online and ws if local so

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,799
i've changed it it's already ws

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,200
yeah and that's because of the ssl

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,359
encryption encryption we don't

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,359
have any aim christian on localhost so

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,200
we just need the single s

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,400
um so at this point we should be able to

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,680
start the server

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,240
um and add that to the obs and we're

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,440
good to go

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,079
uh well we're good to start building

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,040
something

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,319
uh at this point so we started that

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,040
server using

00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,720
the terminal right yeah so the couple

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,839
things you'll need to um

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,480
cd into the project um at least in this

00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,200
this uh

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,240
windows terminal or powershell

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,240
powershell

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,960
all right um here we go

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,960
grab all the

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,440
and then at this they will want to mpm

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,760
install because we do have some local

00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,520
dependencies that we need to um

00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,040
yes create a node modules folder because

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,079
we also had to delete

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,480
our fork i think a lot of these steps

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
are

00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,079
repeated from last week because we

00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:41,280
deleted our fork that's all right so npm

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,599
i or npm install both installs npm

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,040
and then now npm start and we're now

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,400
we're good to go we've gone through the

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,100
entire readme at this point

00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,599
on port 3000 so if we go to localhost

00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:57,119
[Applause]

00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:00,480
3000 should you

00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:03,280
just give me a link um

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,240
so normally things like view and react

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,960
and other

00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,680
tools will provide a link uh we didn't

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,920
write that

00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,960
we could write a response that says

00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,920
here's the link

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,440
um but that would require me to do it

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,240
and i didn't do it for the sake of this

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,680
uh

00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:24,960
this experience uh

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,960
what is it again uh localhost 3000

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:35,920
like there we go excellent

00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,920
um and then we copy localhost don't we

00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,839
okay yeah we've already got it all right

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,839
there we go

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,720
excellent so did is it playing the audio

00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,319
at this point

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,319
um i am not

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,960
sure i didn't hear no audio coming from

00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,880
it somebody started the repo

00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,160
yeah so at this point now we can just

00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,920
have y'all

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,160
start a repo to make sure that we're

00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,000
we've got other people watching us

00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,480
so i dropped a link

00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,480
and um i guess i could start too as well

00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,520
that's also a possibility

00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,400
but where's the fun in that this is this

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,400
is the awkward time

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,680
and you could also check your smee

00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,520
that's actually up and running

00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,760
uh it should be receiving these web

00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,760
hooks

00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,359
oh you do have a server a sme server

00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:38,400
running too as well i know there it is

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:41,040
so if we go to this

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,480
command smee spawn an australian

00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,880
internet

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,880
um

00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,280
is that it um that is not it

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,720
i think we're not actually accepting did

00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,520
we change the json

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,920
this is uh the original ping yes we

00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,160
haven't changed the json

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,200
so in the uh the repo settings uh of

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,240
your fork

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,839
uh yep that's right

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:15,040
replay settings

00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:18,559
yep and then go to your web hook and

00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,559
we will see if it says

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,079
oh yeah yeah so the content type up on

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,000
top

00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:30,240
oh yes it needs to be uh case one yeah

00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,359
yeah this is this is mainly because the

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,040
way we wrote this code

00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,720
oh sorry the way we were so i ended up

00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,880
writing all this a lot of this code

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,160
um the way i'm receiving the json

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,240
started receiving the uh

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,200
the web hook event is i'm i'm expecting

00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,839
json

00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,720
but it was actually url encoded uh

00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,040
information

00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,160
which is gonna give us like a um kind of

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,640
like an html file

00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,400
that um i'm not gonna explain that well

00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,839
because i don't use that i use json in

00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,240
most of my projects so

00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,079
uh we just had to switch that so at this

00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,760
point the star should be received

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,520
uh you should be getting web hook events

00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,799
i think um

00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:06,240
thanks for the mochi uh this

00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,240
just gave us a star so we should see

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,680
that then

00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,280
i'm not seeing anything at the moment

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,839
and we're still not getting anything

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,760
from the smee as well

00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,119
how did was there anything else we

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
changed in here i thought we need to

00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,000
change one of these other ones

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,520
uh we did change uh in the indexation uh

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,720
well

00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,880
that shouldn't matter because the web

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,440
hook is actually connected to your

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,880
account

00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,960
so despite the what's in the the gift.js

00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,440
which is what you change back to my name

00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,839
uh it should twitch handle

00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,599
uh let's try actually restarting the uh

00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,240
the smee server the receiver

00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,119
okay yep how do i do that one again uh

00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,119
open up the uh

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,480
the the powershell that you had yeah you

00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,000
had the tab that i said

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,000
actually to set up finished

00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,680
oh no it's actually server has started

00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,599
yeah

00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,000
so it started and that's that local host

01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,319
we got there no but we had a whole tab

01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,640
for

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,920
smee if you went back there that one

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,520
there

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,280
yeah so it says yeah so why don't we

01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,599
kill this and start it again

01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,200
because we just re we changed the their

01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:29,839
receive

01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:29,839
to json

01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:38,079
it's just kind of sitting there it

01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,480
certainly is um i think though what we

01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,480
could also do

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,520
yeah it looks like we lost uh we lost

01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:48,240
github goodbye good home

01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,280
uh go back into your um so at this point

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,119
we're gonna debug

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,880
uh this and let's just go to the

01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,839
source which is the web hook and your

01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,839
repo settings

01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:06,880
and then on your source you should have

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,880
a place to see events um scroll

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:16,799
i up see events

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,799
uh perhaps all the way at the bottom

01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,480
down here oh recent deliveries oh that's

01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,200
interesting they moved it to

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
the bottom yeah yeah that was not there

01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,880
before

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,599
uh this is the original event when you

01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,960
installed

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,960
don't have any other events

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,440
uh just for the sake of giggles can you

01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:40,480
just double check that that

01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,920
smee url is the same one that you uh

01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,440
passed in manually

01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,440
i'm pretty sure you copy and paste that

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,760
but um pretty sure but let's just double

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,760
check

01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:50,799
kmzk

01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,039
yeah yeah the first five should be the

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:57,039
same yeah and then zmr

01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:02,400
yep it's the same

01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,119
okay and now let's go back to the web

01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,280
server that's running the localhost 3000

01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,720
uh let's actually stop it completely and

01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,760
restart it

01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,599
so just kill it yeah

01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,440
essentially in the terminal yeah we're

01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,720
just gonna

01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,520
yeah we're gonna turn it off and turn it

01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,839
on again npm stop

01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,839
yep

01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:30,559
service started on port 3000

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:35,359
hey there we go

01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,119
so it is the server no issues there

01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,039
that's what happened on the last one

01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,319
except it didn't actually pop up

01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,319
it should have popped up twice

01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,960
theoretically

01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,319
yeah i mean it should be um i'm pretty

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,640
confident people are sort of clicking

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,960
the button for us too as well

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,119
yeah so i've actually got it as a

01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,359
browser source

01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:58,240
too there we go i just refreshed it so

01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:03,119
it should be there now

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,119
so that's our browser source starred

01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,440
and the the secret itself is um indeed

01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,960
the correct secret

01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,319
as well sorry i'm just going down the

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,520
list of i'm going to list the potential

01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:30,240
potential things that could be the

01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:34,400
problem because we only have five steps

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,400
okay thanks for saving my projects

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,400
well fran thanks for coming in we are we

01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,599
are debugging oh

01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,280
lolz i think i know what it is was it

01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,400
the secret or was it the star event

01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,839
wasn't it no

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,319
i think we saved it in

01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,839
here we go and then we didn't push it

01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,839
back

01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:59,839
oh we didn't push it back up to uh yeah

01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:59,839
we didn't push it back to actual gail

01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,599
do i need to well if pushing the github

01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,960
won't

01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,720
it wouldn't do anything because we're

01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,760
doing everything locally so at the

01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,839
moment

01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,200
everything on github doesn't really

01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:18,079
nothing matters

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,240
um this is true because you're trying to

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,160
do it likely aren't we

01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,920
you know people who don't use github you

01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,760
know everybody uses github differently

01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,960
darryl

01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,680
thing we got doubles now it's a it's a

01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,440
power tool

01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,119
uh so we're trying to figure out which

01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,920
drill bits are working for us and which

01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,039
ones aren't

01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,839
um so i think what we need to do is we

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,000
need to start doing some deductive

01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,000
reasoning oh it works

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,000
oh did it did this fire did we need to

01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,160
actually wait

01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,319
for it i don't know i just unstarred and

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,839
raced out and it popped up

01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,280
yeah there's gonna be a time out too as

01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:57,119
well built in so i think oh sorry

01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,440
yeah i think it actually worked someone

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,440
will start um so actually

01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,720
would you say if we go into the web hook

01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,920
we should be able to see

01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:08,799
if it's receiving things yeah

01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,359
you have recent events and we still have

01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,960
the same

01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:14,400
one recent event okay

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,280
wait can you scroll up just real quick

01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,880
just to the uh the check boxes

01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,640
yeah so this is the installation event

01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:25,920
so this is actually

01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:29,039
not useful stars um active

01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:33,599
that seems new yeah

01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,599
let me select enable verification

01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,920
uh oh what's up

01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,079
enable ssl yeah because we're not using

01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:45,280
ssl

01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:48,799
we're using localhost yeah and then

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:50,559
go back and update it yeah

01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,240
uh i wonder i don't remember that being

01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,280
a thing perhaps it's a new

01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,079
a new feature it might be new this is a

01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,640
good thing about

01:05:56,079 --> 01:06:00,559
the good and fun and yay thing about

01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,640
github is they're always doing new

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,000
things

01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,079
yeah i'm actually really intrigued that

01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,079
that was um even there last week

01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,039
okay that's that's when i refresh it

01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,760
okay it could also just be

01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,359
sorry i checked the tape it was there

01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,079
last week i just looked at the youtube

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,079
video yeah

01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:33,839
what else can we debug next so we've got

01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,720
that is all right so we'll go ahead and

01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:38,160
push your

01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,720
your version up to um up to github

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,039
and perhaps we could open up a clicking

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,039
again

01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,039
it might just be really delayed and it

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,960
might just be when i refresh it

01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,720
uh i think that's super refreshing it

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,480
actually shows on refresh

01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,480
uh push your stuff up to github because

01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,760
then i can help debug along with you

01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:03,280
i should create pull requests

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,720
uh create that pull request

01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,160
poor quest is actually not super

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,960
necessary but go ahead and create the

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:14,480
pull request

01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:17,760
okay uh i'm gonna grab your branch

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,480
hang on why is that not working

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,400
sorry uh because you didn't commit any

01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,359
change i didn't commit any changes but

01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,640
why is this not

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:28,960
why does this do this so letting me

01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:32,000
commit my changes to my branch

01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,000
is that a thing in

01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,079
um in github desktop it doesn't look at

01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,160
branches and it looks at the main

01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,680
uh no technically you haven't made any

01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,960
changes i think that's what it is

01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,880
uh because the only thing you created

01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,599
was an emv file

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,599
yeah so why isn't it pushing that back

01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:51,440
uh because the env file is in your dot

01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,920
ignore yes duh because there's a secret

01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,920
yes

01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,280
because it's a secret well i was

01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:57,520
thinking about that sorry

01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,440
yeah so can you go to your your your

01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,960
fork on github.com and create

01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,039
um i think the best way to do this is

01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,119
probably create a code space

01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:10,400
so go to my repos yes

01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:13,680
okay and then we go to

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:17,440
the fork and we create a code space

01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,759
open cross basis uh

01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,759
yes

01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,759
new code space yeah this is this thing

01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,520
daryl

01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,440
and brian where you're saying oh kids

01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,560
these days

01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,839
so easy you can also open this code

01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:39,839
space on your desktop

01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:42,239
who would have thought

01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,239
all right

01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,279
i'm just yeah it's really interesting

01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:52,319
that this doesn't want to

01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,480
the location yeah i am uh

01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,640
it's just still it just still says

01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:00,319
connected

01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:03,679
yeah i'm i'm quite in intrigued

01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,719
because um i can definitely confirm that

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,679
this is uh

01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:10,000
definitely a thing that works um and we

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:21,839
confirmed it last week too

01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:21,839
yeah i suppose i could do

01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,759
yeah everything's definitely fine like

01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,920
the secret and everything is all the

01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,960
same and everything i'm not sure

01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:35,440
ah let's go to the code space though we

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:38,560
are in code spaces all right how do we

01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,560
okay that's huge

01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:47,199
now what do you want to do um

01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,000
now we could create the same the same

01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:51,600
situation

01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,759
uh you'll need to um so copy the a and b

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,480
again

01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,920
uh yeah copy the mvnv um you'll need to

01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,320
run smee

01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,760
and then you also run the localhost but

01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,560
the only difference is we won't add it

01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,600
to

01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,800
um to the browser source in obs

01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,520
um so yeah while you're doing that i'm

01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,920
actually going to

01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,280
repeat the same steps uh just to confirm

01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,400
that i can do the same thing

01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,600
um that you're doing uh and then we'll

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,040
jump into the code space once you get

01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,520
all that set up and then i can help jump

01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,480
around

01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,120
and uh okay and then i use yeah so i

01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,840
install

01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,840
npm again

01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,840
all right so we're using this terminal

01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:38,239
down the bottom here people

01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:41,520
um i don't know if it worked

01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:44,320
new version of npm is available okay

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,080
there is npm seven next time creative

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,320
github action to update missions

01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:52,239
branches

01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,520
uh that that sounds like a great idea

01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:56,480
um zero vulnerabilities code space okay

01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,040
and then

01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,960
what you say we need to do um it's me

01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,960
again

01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,960
you and then we put the url for speaking

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:13,840
go back to my trip to mine settings

01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:28,800
then yeah at this point you're going to

01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,960
be a full-on full-on expert

01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,040
that one doesn't copy and paste url

01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,480
allow

01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,480
i just copied it like three

01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,199
uh times come on not found

01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,040
oh wait which which uh repo are we

01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:48,719
starring were we starting your repo

01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,199
we're starring yours because you said to

01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:55,840
start yours oh

01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,840
cause it's that's oh

01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,960
yes we were starting the wrong repo

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,040
we should have been starring mish

01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,640
manor's get twitch but that means don't

01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,840
we have to change it

01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:16,560
no hold on hold on because go back

01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,040
hold on real quick just go to your your

01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,040
smee

01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,800
that's running um where we have the web

01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,600
hooks you should have one event

01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,480
there it is that's me okay that was me

01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,040
who just did it

01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:28,480
so yes daryl duck does he got it it was

01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,080
news error we were starting the

01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,600
entirely wrong repo we should be

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,760
starring mitch manners slash twitch not

01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,960
be dougie i thought i'm starring yours

01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,040
because if you go

01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,320
in the code doesn't it still have your

01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,560
repo

01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,480
so yes it does this is this is funny

01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,679
so yeah this is what i got confused

01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,520
because it says twitch

01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,040
it says reaper and b dougie that's why i

01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,800
was like oh yeah it's not

01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,880
yeah and that's the confusion because

01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,480
there's other chat integrations

01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,560
so there are chat integrations for

01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,719
specifically to handle

01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,880
this with company.js but the thing that

01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,320
we're working on is the actual web hook

01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,159
and the web hook was installed on your

01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,640
repo and not ours right

01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,760
that does make a lot of sense so i think

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,000
we need to make a decision

01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,040
should we should we be starting which

01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,239
repo should we start

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,000
moving forward mine okay so

01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,280
from now on everybody if you're here

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,159
we're gonna be starting mission managers

01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,920
repo

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,840
now we're going to write some css

01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,120
apologies for the delay but this is this

01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,159
is how you code

01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,159
that's good we let lots of things

01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:30,800
everyone go start my repo can i start

01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,800
our own repo

01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,880
i can't i can actually stop my mind very

01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,960
far

01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,640
yeah and the thing about starring uh is

01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,360
something that i it was a conversation

01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,360
that came up

01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,520
um because i was looking for i was

01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,800
googling yelp for open source projects

01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,760
uh when i was streaming

01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,719
um actually on tuesday and stars are

01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,159
really meant

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:53,199
for saving projects for later star's not

01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,679
really a metric to

01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,679
identify the top projects on github or

01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,960
how well you're doing as a maintainer

01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,719
stars are really just for how many

01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,880
people want to save your project

01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,400
so that's why you can start your own

01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,440
repos because if you want to go to

01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,159
github.com

01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,199
stars you'll see your project um listed

01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:12,800
in your your

01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,640
saved repos so we're getting the um

01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,840
events happening how come they're not

01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,360
coming up through

01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,080
here is it just because it's delayed

01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,400
um what is what are we looking at here

01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:28,239
this is localhost

01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:30,960
uh that's a good question i don't know

01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:32,239
but if this is sorry your dark mode for

01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,600
chrome really throws me off but this

01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,960
looks like a blank screen

01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,719
uh if you open up the chrome console

01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,520
you'll be able to see uh

01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,280
the answer to your question chrome oh

01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,040
wow

01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,679
well there's people like writing things

01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,719
in here this is the chat for github

01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:52,239
what the hell yes so this is this is the

01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:55,280
this code is this is so cool

01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:59,040
yeah so the reason why that the github

01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:01,360
channel is put in the gift.js is because

01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,360
again this integration is more than just

01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,239
starring repos it's actually a full-on

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,760
chat integration

01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:10,080
with twitch um so if you want well

01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,800
technically we're we're capturing github

01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,960
chat

01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,400
yes so and the beauty of this is like

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,920
you went to stream elements or

01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,600
stream labs and built your own chat

01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,040
integrations like this is the backbone

01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,960
of how you would start that

01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,840
now because we're the way the code is

01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,800
written it just puts the chat into the

01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,560
console uh but we could actually create

01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,520
some css and put it on screen if we

01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,679
really wanted to

01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,199
so that's what we want to do right uh we

01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,840
don't want to do that yet because that's

01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:35,040
um i mean we we want to make this a

01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,719
youtube video after the fact that we

01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,440
don't want to put anything that we

01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,560
unsavory uh for youtube but uh let's

01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,560
focus on the

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,679
the web hook first before we get to that

01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,600
so i'm obviously

01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:50,239
getting the uh events now

01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,840
yeah so everything's working uh we just

01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,560
happen to be starting the wrong repo the

01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,520
entire time

01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,520
uh who would have thought

01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,760
i don't know why you're not getting a um

01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,600
the the gif on screen

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,120
doesn't sound quite honest i'm not sure

01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,199
why that's not happening

01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,640
if you hit if you hit a hard refresh on

01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,040
that page would you

01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,320
see anything yeah i get it yeah so

01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,920
there's the gif

01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,760
so i think what right now there's

01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,440
something that's not connecting

01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,600
uh which is actually something we could

01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,080
probably debug um

01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,199
because that chat is not being received

01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,679
through

01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:25,120
um sorry the web hook is not being

01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,320
received

01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:31,120
and empowering the um the events yeah so

01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,560
how how do we debug that like obviously

01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,080
we're getting the event we can see them

01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,560
all here as well

01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,840
yeah so it'd be a there's a top level uh

01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,239
uh project file called

01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,280
index.js uh we can actually just walk

01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:44,640
down that and i'll

01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:48,159
explain a couple things that's good

01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,800
okay uh so yeah so line one

01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,920
through three that's us including a

01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,120
couple things.m

01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,560
is for a secret uh websocket

01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,719
ws that's the thing that we've been

01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,120
handling uh receiving the events

01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,320
uh the web hooks really uh the websocket

01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,800
is actually how you receive the web

01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
hooks

01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,600
and then express is what actually puts

01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,719
stuff on the screen so that's how you're

01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,280
seeing the image

01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,760
um it's actually powering a web server

01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,760
um

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,199
line six is actually octokit webhooks

01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,040
it's a it's a great tool

01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,239
actually tomorrow right here on github

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,840
folks are asking if github has been

01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:20,080
streaming we've been streaming since

01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,360
i think may of last year uh and we've

01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,120
been doing open source fridays we don't

01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,239
do every friday we try to do as many

01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,440
fridays as we can

01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:29,440
get guests but tomorrow friday um

01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,120
tomorrow as in the american time zone

01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:33,360
tomorrow um

01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,520
we will have the creator of octokit

01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:38,080
webhooks actually on stream with me

01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,280
chatting about a new tool he built so

01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,719
just want to give a shout out because it

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:44,239
just felt like it fit

01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:45,520
um line 9 through 11 we can kind of just

01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,880
guess that's how the secret's being

01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,679
handled we're actually grabbing it that

01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,719
way

01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,719
um and then now at this point we have

01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,320
the console.log that output

01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:55,520
um that's actually receiving our web

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,719
hooks and this is what should be

01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,480
powering

01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:02,640
uh the code on the screen now

01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,760
the question now is why are we not

01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:07,120
seeing that

01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:10,159
so we should be in const out

01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,239
name event payload sender again

01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:13,679
oh so okay so if you actually went to

01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,400
your server that's running localhost

01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,600
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,920
on your terminal uh that's

01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,719
that should give us so this is these

01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,080
this is me

01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:26,159
so we have another tab tim oh yeah

01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,679
that is our beautiful error message so

01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:30,159
to answer your question

01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,880
why is it not working it's that error

01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:34,239
what does that

01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:36,080
say um i would scroll to the top

01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:40,960
so these are this is uh it's all the

01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,960
same thing okay yeah so that's not

01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,960
so that's that's the answer uh which i

01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,320
can i can translate that for you but

01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,679
just real quick i wanted to point out

01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,080
that it's not the same thing

01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,520
it's a stack trace so the stack trace is

01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,480
actually pointing us to file

01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,880
line numbers of where the problem is um

01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,320
so

01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,159
if we looked at that stack trace we'd

01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,120
eventually find out what line number is

01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,440
broken

01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:05,280
um and it really just comes down to the

01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,560
signature strat trace means our secret

01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,320
is not matching

01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:12,719
um so the secret that's in uh

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,080
in your repo setting up your web hook

01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:18,080
has to be the same thing that's in the

01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,080
emv file and it should be

01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:23,199
that it should be

01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:25,040
but we should double check just in case

01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,640
because we we did spend it like a good

01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,679
30 minutes on user error

01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:33,679
of the repos we did

01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,679
it's definitely the same thing

01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:41,040
unless it hasn't copied over

01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,040
for some reason

01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:48,840
okay it's definitely the exact same

01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,320
thing i'll let you just copy and pasted

01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,400
it

01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,000
uh and i get like the next next step

01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,560
would be actually googling that error

01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,159
message

01:19:54,560 --> 01:20:00,800
signal stack trace this match not match

01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:02,640
whatever it was um that's usually the

01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,199
best way to get yours get closer to the

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,199
it's working

01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,280
that's i think you actually have no idea

01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:14,080
if that's working or not

01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,360
again just in case the one way to see if

01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,840
it's working is just go to your

01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:24,400
your terminal that's open yeah

01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:27,600
it's still broken okay so let's go find

01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:32,400
signatures does not match event payload

01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:35,440
because it could be that

01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,440
probot era

01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,600
uh probot's uh it's a good direction

01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,320
probot is actually a thing another tool

01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,800
that github

01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,960
created um that uses all the tools we're

01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:48,000
using it just come packaged into one

01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,920
one tool possible is it the web

01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
secret or the repository doesn't match

01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,120
with the web hook

01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,880
we totally check that sometimes bugs

01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,400
just work themselves out

01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:03,679
oh yeah the right thing though

01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:05,199
okay change it and then see what happens

01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,199
yeah i mean change it to something else

01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,280
in both places uh and then restart the

01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:11,280
servers just make sure you hit update

01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,719
um and then while folks do that i'll

01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,080
explain what probot is probot is

01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,880
actually a tool i used to do a lot of

01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,040
work on

01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,400
um back when i first joined github when

01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,239
i say work i didn't actually contribute

01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,880
a lot of code to it but

01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,800
i did create some videos and some uh

01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,320
courses and stuff like that for it

01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:31,199
and it's it's kind of the predecessor to

01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,520
um github actions github actions being

01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,480
the

01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,679
sort of uh tool to do ci cd but also

01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:38,800
repo automation

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,199
uh probot was really 100 repo automation

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,440
well

01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:42,560
i say was it still is it's an active

01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,239
project but

01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,920
uh if you're interested in a video that

01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,719
i created um

01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,639
uh me building a probot app uh if you

01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,800
wanna get like a really quick

01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:55,440
understanding uh i just drop one in the

01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,960
chat if anybody's interested

01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,199
all right so it's only happening on

01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:03,040
screen all right so

01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:08,080
that was 100 uh success 200. so

01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:08,080
your change uh it looks like it worked

01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:16,639
yeah i just star event received

01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:19,679
yep so i don't want to say that

01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,440
that the the secret was incorrect but um

01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:23,440
i didn't actually change it i just

01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,880
restarted this

01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,880
oh you just restarted the server okay

01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,120
i honestly think we never restarted the

01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,560
server no we didn't restart the server

01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,719
after we updated it from there

01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:38,719
we started it again yeah they say like

01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,719
you know if in doubt turn it off and on

01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,440
what cs alex said sometimes bugs just

01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,880
work themselves out and literally that's

01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:48,719
what happened

01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:52,000
um so we are now we are now at the point

01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,840
where somebody's actually doing things

01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,840
yes stop is on the screen

01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,040
somebody start again

01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,400
yeah you can see those you see those

01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,880
post requests down on the bottom there's

01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,719
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,000
if you stay on the screen you'll see

01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,040
another one come through so we have

01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,280
number five come through

01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,159
coming through okay they coming through

01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,360
all right so

01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:15,120
folks this is this is the repo that we

01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,000
just dropped it actually i don't know

01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,000
if you need the um

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,239
yeah i'm not sure where everybody's at

01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,600
with the uh uh if how much

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,320
context you have because i know people

01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,880
jump in and out of this thing um

01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,400
we now have a working product which i'm

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:34,080
super excited about

01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:36,719
um we now every time you start that repo

01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,800
the dapp punctuation will come up so i

01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,840
think something we should be doing

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,400
is one we should probably say who

01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,000
who is starring the repo see if we can

01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,600
get that context

01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,080
on the screen and then the other thing

01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,040
is probably add some css to that name

01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,159
so i'd keep the daf puncta cat there uh

01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,600
and then maybe below

01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,440
we can add the name of the person who

01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:01,280
started the repo okay

01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,880
let's do that okay so now

01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,560
here's going to be the fun part if we go

01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,280
to if we're going to need to read the

01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,120
payload

01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,320
to understand what context uh we're

01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,600
going to get

01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,840
so that way we're not we're not shooting

01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,560
blind from the hip um

01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,480
and i think the best way to do this is

01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,679
going into

01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,000
actually if you went back to your local

01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,880
host if you scrolled up

01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,360
uh localhost in the server accepted

01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,920
false

01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,400
these error messages that's fine um if

01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,719
you go

01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:34,080
back to um the smee

01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,360
ah it says table okay so see how we have

01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,159
the name there we want to be able to

01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,840
grab that name

01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:41,840
yeah and move it into um

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,080
put it onto the screen so this might

01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:47,440
take a little a little bit of

01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:49,520
work and it might actually

01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,960
let's let's take a step because we're

01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,840
going to need to do some architecture

01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,040
and planning

01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,719
so we have two different things we're

01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,280
going to do we originally came here that

01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,080
we're going to

01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,880
edit some css that's gonna be something

01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,040
we could do

01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,080
or we can get names on the screen but i

01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,840
don't think we can do

01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,760
we can't do both at the same time so

01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,960
we'll have to pick one or the other

01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,080
why can't we do both of this

01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,120
because that's how programmers fail okay

01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,840
do one thing

01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:17,120
let's do css because that should be oh

01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,560
actually why don't we let the chat

01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:20,159
decide

01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,840
all right chat do you want to see us do

01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,840
some javascript and get the name

01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,600
your name on the screen and that would

01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,199
be satisfying or do you want us to do

01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,920
some css

01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:33,920
uh some copy and paste css

01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,920
jsj

01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,560
everyone's like make it pretty no css js

01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,920
okay i think for this looks like we're

01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,840
mostly jss

01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,800
i'm going to put it out yeah so michelle

01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,480
looks like you're going to be doing some

01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,960
css on your own or we can do it at the

01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,560
end

01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,239
uh honestly i think the css is going to

01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,239
be pretty quick so

01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,239
let's do the names i i like getting

01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:59,360
people i like people having

01:25:56,239 --> 01:26:00,880
their personal touch oh yeah twitch does

01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,560
have a poll feature isn't it that's okay

01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,840
we're going with javascript

01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:09,199
yeah i mean the voting's over

01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,239
uh so the the noun basically we can do

01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:12,719
some deductive

01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,239
uh searching uh by looking for that star

01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,760
event received word

01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:18,400
uh we already have some code that's

01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,239
already doing the work for us

01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,440
um and it's probably gonna be in our

01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:24,480
index.js

01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,800
and uh i'm saying it i'm saying it like

01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,960
uh

01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,320
i didn't write this code but for the

01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,199
sake of everybody

01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,400
um who hasn't seen this code yet uh we

01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:36,159
should find that

01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:39,360
uh it's actually line 14 is it this one

01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:40,560
uh yes yep yep that is it so we need to

01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,840
be able to

01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,840
so what we're doing is we're getting a

01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,480
payload uh directly from the web hook

01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,040
event

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,800
and then we're console logging that

01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,800
directly to the console that we're

01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,920
i mean this might be obvious but i'm not

01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,120
sure where everybody's coming from but

01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,800
everybody loves js

01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,880
apparently use js to mod css

01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,560
js and css that they don't they don't

01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,199
mix well they do mix well i'm just

01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,040
kidding

01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,719
but um we need to be able to get this

01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:08,080
payload sender uh

01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,960
to our localhost server so this is going

01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:12,400
to be

01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,000
um some some good work so we already

01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,280
have that output that's being console

01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,400
logged that output on line

01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:20,560
15. i think what we probably could do

01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,880
is it is actually being outputted it's

01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,000
just black text so you can barely see

01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,199
it uh you're saying the text is actually

01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,520
on the um

01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:30,560
the screen yeah well it was it was just

01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,639
black

01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,239
you can't see it sorry go to the local

01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,120
host so we are already doing this

01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:38,560
oh yeah so the local host shows it as

01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:42,320
white

01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:44,880
the black um the

01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:46,560
way to go local host shows it as white

01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,760
but um when we go

01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:52,800
to here it shows that yeah see

01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,800
star get ticked

01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,159
yeah so but we don't have their name

01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,080
there at that point

01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:00,400
no we don't so i don't know outlook just

01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,719
decided to open itself

01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,080
okay all right no reading email we're

01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,679
we're writing code right now yeah i know

01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:08,639
i was like i don't know

01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,320
go away outlook yeah so the client the

01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,040
client's receiving the output but we're

01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,960
actually we're

01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:15,360
we're putting the different words on the

01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,719
screen so we haven't actually handed

01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,960
um handed the payload

01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,480
all the way over that book is over yeah

01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,520
so if we look at it now it's on the

01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,280
screen and it

01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:29,040
should be a little bit of black text you

01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:32,800
can just see just above it

01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:35,600
yeah yeah but but that's also

01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,239
um i did see it but it's also completely

01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,560
different

01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:39,520
um yeah so basically daryl's kind of

01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,280
explaining it like where

01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,600
right now we're looking at the server

01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,920
context and that's saying names

01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,360
in the client which is our html page

01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,840
it's saying something completely

01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,880
different

01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,199
it doesn't say anybody who um

01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,639
who started the repo so what what we

01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,880
need to do is actually

01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,840
pass in the data from who starred the

01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,040
repo

01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,440
to the front end client basically and

01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,159
this this app is pretty simplistic we're

01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,400
on line

01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:08,080
13 we're actually grabbing that data

01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,480
we're constantly logging but we're not

01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:14,000
actually doing anything on line 21

01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:18,560
uh to do the what am i trying to say

01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,639
the wss client yeah okay

01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,320
uh but it looks like on line 23 we're

01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:26,480
sending it to the client

01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:30,000
yes uh it's not actually receiving it so

01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:30,560
um let me see we're going to the app

01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,320
express

01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,239
sorry it's been a while since i actually

01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:37,760
wrote this code um

01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:39,120
october 15 2020 uh was the last time i

01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,760
which i just looked at the last commit

01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:43,760
history

01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:45,280
uh so i think we're

01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,199
we're passing it to the client but we're

01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,679
not actually passing it to

01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:53,360
okay the client itself on line 13 is

01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:55,040
actually what our server is yeah um

01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,480
but we need to get it we need to get it

01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:59,040
to line 42

01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,400
uh so we should be passing it to in a uh

01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:03,600
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:07,840
there console.log service started

01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,840
onboard 3 000.

01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,920
is being owed to the console

01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,320
well this being logged here

01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,199
uh yeah and that's still gonna be our

01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:29,199
back end so yeah

01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,480
i think what we'll probably do client.js

01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:34,639
needs to

01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:37,280
not log to console

01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,440
lots of t no you are being it's being

01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:49,840
logged to the console the client yes

01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:49,840
needs to not log to the console

01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,639
where'd all these come from uh those are

01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,440
all coming from

01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,880
our back end web hook receiver server so

01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,120
from here

01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,920
yeah well that's where we're outputting

01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,159
it yeah

01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,159
okay

01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,920
all right

01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,880
yeah sorry i'm i'm watching daryl and uh

01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:22,159
planner go back

01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,960
uh back and forth on this um so i think

01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,560
the the

01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,080
the best course of action is actually

01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,360
just trying to get the that data into

01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,360
our express server

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,960
so what i'm gonna actually look up could

01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,080
you just google

01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,080
we're going to we're going to do some

01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:39,280
google food real quick um let's do it

01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:44,000
can we google uh

01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:47,280
wss express

01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,480
that's it yeah we're gonna have to look

01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:53,280
up in the documentation

01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:58,639
on how to understand pmjs

01:31:53,280 --> 01:32:03,600
yeah and it looks like we can do

01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:09,840
uh ws.send um let's try that

01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:09,840
what was that sorry ws.send

01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:14,320
yeah sorry i'm looking at what's the

01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:17,199
best way i can send this to you

01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:19,760
uh can i send you a message in slack yep

01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:21,199
i'll open up slack

01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,120
yeah so this is actually the the

01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:26,480
websocket server that we're using with

01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:28,480
express that works together uh literally

01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:31,440
the page i had open

01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:33,120
yeah yeah so this this doesn't explain

01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,760
how to pass the data make sure your

01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:35,760
express

01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,840
module before loading routers express

01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:41,840
after setting up expressws

01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,840
websocket routes um

01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,520
oh is that uws and i don't know what

01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,639
that was

01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,880
this is the link we're looking at okay

01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:55,840
oh i don't know where that came from

01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,840
some random thing off my copy clipboard

01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,679
okay make sure

01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,880
full example

01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,639
you need the middleware so this one

01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,480
console.log middleware

01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,080
yeah and we do so we have the middleware

01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:14,550
on line 39

01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,760
of that file we were just looking at

01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:17,280
[Applause]

01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,880
that middleware should be able to

01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:21,920
receive

01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,440
the rest of that that that context so we

01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,480
can get the the payload from the

01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:28,000
middleware

01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,719
um that would be my my guess that we can

01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,960
get

01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:36,880
um but i have to listen to three seven

01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,880
constant log socket rest questing

01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,199
that's the web hooks middleware not the

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,920
web sockets ah okay yeah so we're i'm

01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:51,440
i'm conflating two things no i was like

01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,000
that says web hook right

01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,800
is that the same thing as web yeah so

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,280
the web

01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,360
the ym41 initialized the web server to

01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:03,280
be used by the web sockets

01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:06,800
um i wonder if we could actually pass in

01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:09,840
some arguments to line 42.

01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,560
um and this is me basically shooting

01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,800
from the hip

01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:16,840
so uh on line 42 after the word uh the

01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,800
number 3000 there's those

01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,560
parentheses yeah uh this is a place we

01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,440
could actually put in some arguments

01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,600
can you just put the word x there or is

01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:29,199
this the letter x

01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,199
and then in the console.log

01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,360
to the right can you just add a comma

01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:36,560
after the last

01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,560
uh parentheses

01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,480
and then add x yes so i just want to see

01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,080
um

01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,760
again this is this is how i code i shoot

01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,560
from the hip uh we'll need to kill the

01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,080
server

01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,920
uh restart the server and we'll see if

01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,800
that x gets printed to the server okay

01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,400
so

01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,679
this over here yeah oh sorry that's the

01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:56,560
um

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,840
which one is this is the localhost yes

01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:02,719
yes

01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:05,280
you're correct okay cool oops

01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,639
stopped it i think yeah we already

01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,679
killed it

01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,679
npm stop

01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:18,960
undefined okay

01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:20,400
so x is undefined is that what it means

01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,639
yeah so there are actually no arguments

01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:26,719
being passed to the uh the web server

01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,719
um apps middleware

01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,880
so we'll need to actually look up to see

01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,639
um

01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,239
what indeed the middleware is adding for

01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,239
us then what pokes that middleware

01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:43,840
actor is

01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,119
so x is we didn't define x anyway right

01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:54,159
that's why it's

01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,880
giving us that error right uh well we

01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:57,679
didn't define

01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,239
x but sometimes uh in javascript we'll

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:00,560
pass in

01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:02,000
extra arguments like error messages uh

01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,520
directly in there so i was just shooting

01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,199
from the hip to be able to see if there

01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,119
was an object being returned

01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,639
that we weren't looking at uh the other

01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:10,719
thing that we could look up is that up

01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:13,920
on top there's octokid's web hook

01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:19,119
so that's what the web hook um

01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:19,119
is providing to us that is back up here

01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,119
yeah and i think what we probably could

01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:26,000
do is see if there is

01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:27,360
so yeah um opticate web hooks you can

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,199
actually google that you'll get another

01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:32,159
npm page uh that will give us

01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:34,400
i don't know if that's actually gonna

01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,400
give us

01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:39,280
actually there we go uh it does give us

01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,960
a payload and that's what we're using

01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,360
uh so yeah is this the github page or

01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,320
the um npm page do you want the github

01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,679
page

01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:48,560
uh npm is fine i just sorry i can't tell

01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,520
what the uh

01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,000
dark mode so daryl's saying line 22 is

01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,520
mirroring

01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,880
the web hook info to the client

01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:02,480
ah like 22 22

01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,480
here it says if

01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:09,679
jss equals

01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,679
wss clients

01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:17,040
hey no js i don't know

01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,960
for each client it's sending the output

01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:26,239
that's what we're getting

01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:29,119
here right back here

01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:30,400
like we're getting a output for each

01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:35,119
thing that's happening

01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:38,159
the client needs a websocket listener

01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:39,600
so i should go back and remove x yeah

01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:41,600
yeah remove x because that's not going

01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,080
to give us any any benefit

01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,520
uh if you go into the public index.html

01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:47,679
once you delete that

01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,440
code that we put in we can show the

01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,480
websocket listener

01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:55,040
this one here is that it here yeah

01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:57,520
all right so yes the code is reading the

01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:02,239
web hook and then forwarding it yes

01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:05,600
and so i guess my my next guess would be

01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:09,520
um if we were going to

01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:11,920
yeah okay so we're in the right place um

01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,000
here is where i probably add another on

01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,320
open we can do connectionist establish

01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,360
i receive the e meshes data okay so line

01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,639
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:22,800
uh we have i received the message e.data

01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,480
okay so that's what we need to change is

01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,280
it

01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:29,360
um well actually the thing is because

01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:32,960
it's saying here i received a message

01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:35,440
star event received so it's oh gotcha

01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,480
it's giving whatever that message well

01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,600
it's not there

01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:41,520
okay this is

01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,600
this is where we can do our magic okay

01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,360
so this is it yes so daryl

01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,199
everybody we're we're finally to the

01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,000
point we are so we need to be able to

01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:51,679
find

01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,840
um we have e

01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,440
and then we have e data i wonder what

01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,080
would happen if we um

01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:00,800
instead of if we comment out line 20 and

01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,600
instead just do console.log e

01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,350
okay uh so now we can see the full

01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,439
object

01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:08,439
[Applause]

01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,520
yep and save that and then um go into

01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,960
our chrome console

01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,800
uh and you're gonna have to help me out

01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:17,280
a bit with the uh chrome console because

01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,840
it's

01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,800
extremely small yeah that's okay i don't

01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,679
even there we go

01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,199
i can't actually zoom in on it yeah and

01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:26,000
you can even pop that out and make its

01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:29,760
own window

01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,760
um so that way you're not constrained to

01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,880
yeah that works perfect um so scroll to

01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:38,080
uh hit refresh and

01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,080
scroll to the top of the console

01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:45,280
okay well okay so message

01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:46,880
hi there i'm a websocket server yes

01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,639
that thank you very much websocket

01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:53,920
server can you hit the

01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:56,159
the down arrow uh to expand that a bit

01:39:53,920 --> 01:40:00,080
yep and then

01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:03,520
do we not have a payload um that says

01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,520
so and so start the event

01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,080
there we go down the bottom so that's

01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:10,960
the next one message received start

01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,960
event received

01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:17,600
um origin localhost source

01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:19,520
oh there we go uh that message event

01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,800
star event received

01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,400
um why is that uh

01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,840
okay well that comes in that's actually

01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:28,159
that's actually perfect

01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,080
um so we're getting a message event we

01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:32,400
just need to get the message event

01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:33,679
data which is then getting logged to the

01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,800
console

01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:38,560
okay so yeah so

01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,080
i think what we need to do is this yep

01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,960
actually there we go

01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:44,000
see where planet says unstarted starred

01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,239
actually

01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,360
sorry we didn't actually comment out

01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:50,480
their comments

01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,960
um everything you made is any data yeah

01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,719
correct

01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,040
so we just need to make this less noisy

01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:58,400
uh so we can do some work with that so

01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:01,119
go back to the index.html yep

01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,480
uh and we don't want uh there we can

01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:05,119
actually just pull

01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:06,560
for now let's comment out the gif alert

01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:07,840
um

01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,679
actually we can leave the gif alert

01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:14,560
because we can work with that sorry

01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:14,560
um let's comment out remove flex

01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:20,000
yes

01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,760
all right sorry we're commenting out

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,040
which one

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,560
um actually this is this is all fine

01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,639
we can just pass in the data as an

01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,760
argument perhaps

01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:34,880
into here uh yeah actually

01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,920
let's not break any of that okay

01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,920
sorry don't break it

01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:42,880
we should send a json object instead of

01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,280
a string so we can grab the name of the

01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,280
user

01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,600
ah okay that i think that might be a

01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:52,800
better idea

01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,239
so let's go back to the so basically

01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,000
i'm just gonna explain real quick so

01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,520
that way for my debugging purposes

01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,440
and everybody else who's watching and

01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,840
for you we can just

01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,040
connect with the dots okay and the index

01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,400
in this page

01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,800
we ended up discovering that the

01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:10,800
websocket receiver is here

01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:12,719
uh we are actually so when do i start

01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,840
yeah we gotta send him our resume sorry

01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:14,719
are you gonna send your resume over

01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,480
darryl duck

01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:21,280
um we the web hook receiver happens

01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,760
between what line 14 that's where it

01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,400
gets

01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,199
started uh we're opening the socket

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,119
between

01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,480
the back-end server to our front-end

01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:30,159
client and the front-end client is where

01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,600
we're sitting right now

01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:33,600
and then on the messages that we're

01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,760
receiving from the web sockets

01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,520
so not to be confused of chat messages

01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:40,320
these are messages from the server

01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:42,000
to our front end they're now

01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:46,239
console.logging e.data

01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,440
e.data at this point is so and so

01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:49,440
well it's basically everything it's

01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:50,159
unstructured all right it's getting a

01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,719
string

01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:54,239
it's everything so put on start and

01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,800
start

01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:57,600
and that that's the event there actually

01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,440
so yeah

01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,119
it's and you can actually see if you go

01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,239
back there online if you look to the

01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:04,800
right

01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:05,360
of this like the top part is what we

01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,600
want

01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,360
all the stuff on the right is gift is

01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,000
the gift.js

01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:12,400
messages so to make this easier for us

01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,320
to

01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,679
to debug we should probably just comment

01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:18,080
the comfy.js chat

01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:19,600
on line 57 so that when we stop getting

01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:25,360
the chat messages from twitch

01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:25,360
and we can just get chat messages for um

01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,440
uh this one 57 yeah i would just comment

01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,480
uh

01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:38,800
57 to 59 just so we can we can

01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,480
um only get the stuff where we're trying

01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:45,360
to work on and we get less noise

01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:48,880
uh to where we're uh i'm picking it up

01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:51,280
okay excellent so yeah save that um

01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:53,040
we'll want to uncomment that later but

01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,679
for now

01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:58,800
let's go back to the console.log uh just

01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,800
to ensure we're getting there uh

01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,480
that's the only data we're getting in

01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,199
the um yeah let's go ahead and hit

01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,280
refresh

01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:07,840
yep and then we have the message event

01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,840
okay so

01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,600
now what daryl was saying is that in our

01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,800
data

01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:16,480
instead of sending just a string hi

01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,159
i'm a websocket server and then the next

01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:20,800
string is going to be

01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:21,679
um so-and-so started event or or

01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,280
whatever

01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,719
uh we should probably just send json so

01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,800
we could just pull the name directly out

01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,000
of it so we could structure this

01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,159
we have the ability to structure the

01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,280
data and the way we can manage it so go

01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:34,000
back

01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:36,639
go all the way back to the index.js

01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,960
which is going to be again this is our

01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,320
it's it's a bit confusing because like

01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,440
we technically have a front end and a

01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,600
back end

01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,719
but it's not very structured in folders

01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,840
that are named

01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,880
like that but i'm just going to

01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,239
reference

01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,159
and i'm just going to refer to this in

01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:53,440
the future just as our back end okay so

01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,960
this is all the messages that are

01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,400
happening here which is the hi i'm a

01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,159
websocket server

01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:03,280
yes so uh

01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:04,639
glock works uh to do fix me to remind

01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:08,719
you to uncomment that later

01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:12,880
which is a good practice um okay

01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:14,800
here actually so

01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,639
what do you say yeah this is why this is

01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:20,239
why they're commenting

01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:22,000
like like that like yes

01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:23,840
yeah because in that way you can search

01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,320
or when we go to review this code it's

01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,840
gonna

01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,360
it's gonna jump out at us and say oh

01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:31,600
yeah that's right we should fix this

01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:34,719
okay and then and then if if you uh

01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,360
to do fixing yeah i mean if we do forget

01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,360
about this

01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,199
then we're all gonna be shamed uh that's

01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,719
why get blame is a thing

01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:42,239
because then we can blame whoever left

01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:45,920
that comment in there which

01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:49,760
in this case will be you okay

01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,760
thanks for putting all the blame on me

01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,440
all right so all right let's go back to

01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,239
our back end

01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,280
uh well actually we're here oh yeah yeah

01:45:56,239 --> 01:46:01,840
so

01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:03,360
this um did ws.send

01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,040
yeah down the bottom that i've

01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:08,560
highlighted yeah

01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,560
yeah so we're sending

01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,360
so wait where i'm actually share that

01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,040
blame around yes everybody's actually

01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,320
pair programming with us right now so we

01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,920
all get the blame

01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,360
we'll add you to the we're gonna add

01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,320
collectively everybody in the chat to

01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,080
the commit history

01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,360
so that way we all get a notification

01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,280
when we uh

01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,400
when the boss walks knocks on our door

01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:30,639
and says hey um

01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,639
this code you sent um

01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:36,880
i i'm the yeah okay

01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,920
gotcha so the hello i'm a websocket

01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,440
server um

01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,880
that's a string that we're sending could

01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,520
you scroll up because that's going to be

01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:45,760
an issue

01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:49,360
if we change the json data to be json

01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:52,480
okay so is that something that uh

01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:52,480
sorry i'm just like uh

01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,880
can you search sorry i'm just uh asking

01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,800
if um

01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,119
if you do you see it saying hello i'm a

01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:04,800
web soccer server right down the bottom

01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:06,080
hi there okay gotcha and then yeah if we

01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,560
go here it's like hi there i'm a

01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,960
websocket server

01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,400
yeah so instead of saying sending this

01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,639
like

01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,679
highs uh strings we'll probably just

01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:19,760
want to instead

01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:21,119
send a message um

01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:23,119
we want to create some javascript

01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:25,760
objects that we can make in the json

01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:26,400
um are you familiar like when i say json

01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,840
what that means

01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:30,400
oh no really yeah so actually just

01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,400
google

01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,320
um json real quick because i'll probably

01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,520
bet you a better explanation

01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,920
so while you're doing it i'll explain

01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,560
just a bit of an idea but not really

01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:42,719
that much

01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:46,000
but okay it's it's it's the way you can

01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:49,040
data interchange format so you go object

01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,159
like okay yeah and it's a way to pass

01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,320
data back and forth

01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:53,360
so imagine like when i if i send you a

01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,080
text message

01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,679
uh it's gonna send that data over to you

01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,199
uh and the way the phone receives it it

01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,320
receives it in a certain structure

01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:02,239
that's readable

01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,600
and daryl i think i'm pretty sure

01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,159
darrell cause daryl's been pretty on

01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,920
fire

01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:07,280
of giving us pushing us in the right

01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,000
direction um

01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,639
was saying to send the entire object as

01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,560
json

01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:13,920
instead of sending a string because

01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,679
what's happening is we're sending like

01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,560
these high ammo web socket servers as a

01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,480
string

01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,840
and then we're setting a string of like

01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,400
hey here's some output

01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:24,800
as a string and then some data and like

01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,280
we we don't know what to expect

01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,040
um on the receiving end on the client

01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,080
and to be able to present that properly

01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:33,280
on the screen

01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:35,119
um so

01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:37,040
thank you woodhouse for sending this

01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:40,719
sorry um that you're

01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:42,320
um yeah this is probably

01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,840
yeah yeah i don't know what article

01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,239
you're looking at but this is probably

01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,600
the

01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,840
the pretty much standard of where you

01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:51,119
would find the context of this

01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,400
of what json is and i think that's

01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:54,719
probably a better description too as

01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:56,560
well oh yeah i did learn a little bit of

01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,159
this stuff

01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,520
yeah so this is the type of data we want

01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:00,960
to receive and it's this type of data

01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,159
we're receiving from github

01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,719
every time there's a star so for the

01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:06,400
sake of this

01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,320
with daryl's like think dictionary

01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,679
phrase yes thank you

01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:14,159
okay there we go sort of yeah which is

01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:16,560
it's a hard sort of too as well

01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:18,239
i i got what he meant daryl's the one

01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,560
that comes into all my

01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:23,520
c-sharp streams helps me out with those

01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:25,679
oh it's fine hey project how are you

01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,280
yeah so what we'll probably want to do

01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:28,320
is we still want to send those messages

01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,560
hi i'm a

01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:32,320
websocket server yeah but we can

01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,480
actually stringify we can actually just

01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:37,679
make that json instead so

01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:38,800
um everywhere we what we have ws.send

01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,119
we're going to change to

01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,480
to send json objects so we can start

01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:44,800
with the we could start

01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:46,159
at the first one uh which is i think

01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:51,119
it's going to be the message

01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:53,119
received um let's double check

01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:55,119
um it's not this one at the top event

01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:57,280
received no that's

01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:58,239
anywhere where's ws.send we're gonna

01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,880
have to send

01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:02,239
json ws.com i think it's that's the

01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,080
first time but we can just double check

01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:07,119
it anyway

01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:09,440
yeah it's only these two yeah okay

01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:11,440
you send a whatever message and then

01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:13,599
hide there on the website server

01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,520
yeah so let's delete the string what's

01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:19,679
instead just send the message object

01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,679
on the ws.cent because i wonder if um

01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:26,080
sorry back out of that like that um

01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,760
uh not like that don't change that one

01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,960
we wanted to change the one in line 52.

01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,679
so we're gonna go top down

01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:34,159
oh okay sorry this one so just get rid

01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:37,280
of this and just leave the message there

01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:39,760
um yes

01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,760
so remove the dollar too as well it

01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,040
should just be the message

01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,639
i don't know if this will actually work

01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,560
but i don't know if ws is going to

01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:49,040
stringify our json for us or not

01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,320
the kelly brackets around us no no we're

01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,599
going to assume that the curly the

01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:55,119
message event will

01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:55,840
send as a a json event why don't you use

01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:59,119
the live

01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:01,040
code for vs code uh

01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:03,280
that would make it too easy actually why

01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:06,400
don't we use the vs code live

01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:08,480
how do you do that do you have live

01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,239
share installed uh go to the um

01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,760
the square boxes on the left where the

01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:15,440
plugins are

01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:19,040
uh live card live share

01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,599
a live stream yeah so you wanna install

01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,000
that

01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:22,639
oh now we can work on it together

01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,560
honestly

01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,000
it never even crossed my mind see this

01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,159
is why we have a chat while we're doing

01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,159
this

01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,719
is this the client listening for

01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,719
multiple events

01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,320
start your collaborations so i just go

01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,920
share

01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:40,239
yeah and you you don't want to share

01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,480
your url unless you want everybody else

01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:44,159
to jump in yes

01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,480
well we didn't blame you about now we'll

01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:49,599
just do you so

01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:50,320
what do i do uh so i would actually

01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,639
click away

01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,440
and you want to sign in with github uh

01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:55,280
it will show your

01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,560
login credentials it might show your

01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,760
email i'm not sure if that

01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:00,159
if people haven't figured out what your

01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,760
email is authorized

01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,679
for live stream yeah oh yeah obviously

01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,080
i'm hiding scared double check what

01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:05,440
we're doing

01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:08,159
yeah usually whenever i need to

01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:08,159
collaborate

01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:12,719
usually when i walk into stuff i always

01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,440
hide my screen mainly because you just

01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:16,639
never know

01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:18,719
you never know what okay so

01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,920
allow an extension to open this url

01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:23,199
signing in

01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:24,719
starting collaboration session is in the

01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:29,199
auto connection

01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:32,880
okay allow access

01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:35,280
is getting around my firewalls now um

01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,880
invitation links copy to clipboard send

01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:40,719
it to anyone you trust

01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:42,840
in the chat make it read only or

01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:44,159
just leave it i can just send it to you

01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,000
obviously

01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:47,360
yeah if you send it to me yeah in slack

01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,400
i can wrap that

01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:53,679
okay is that it yep

01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:56,159
uh i am now opening from mish manners i

01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:59,840
think i can trust this

01:52:56,159 --> 01:53:02,960
really can you actually trust me

01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,719
all right this is really excellent

01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,480
yeah it's it's funny because i know i

01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:09,440
did this thing was a thing

01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:11,280
how how have i not had this not

01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:14,080
literally not one person

01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,159
the whole time i've been live coding has

01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,800
offered this solution to me people come

01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:20,480
in they're like

01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,480
no go up no go here

01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:24,000
that's like we could have just done this

01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:24,880
the whole time so i was like i don't

01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,960
know

01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,360
um well i can oh this is really good i

01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,280
can accept or reject users

01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,800
it's super handy for pair programming i

01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,560
know right

01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,920
yeah and what i usually do so i don't

01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,360
usually do this on my stream but every

01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,400
now and then if i get to a point when

01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:40,560
i'm live coding

01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,080
uh and folks are like giving me like

01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:44,239
just in like this

01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,280
i will definitely go and whisper folks

01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:47,760
and let them

01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:50,080
let them in on the coding fun i also do

01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:52,800
this with design so i do a bit of figma

01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,159
as well and i let everybody sort of join

01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:56,480
in on the fun um

01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:58,080
on figma because it's got the nice you

01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:01,679
know collaborative design

01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:04,239
elements as well um so we go back to

01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:04,960
us now where are you how do i see you

01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,400
and uh

01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,080
i actually haven't i'm getting the

01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,320
spinning wheel of depth so

01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:12,480
i'm going to actually restart real quick

01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:14,320
uh restart vs code i just said you left

01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:22,320
the session

01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:26,480
it sounds read only how do i fix that

01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:28,880
uh i have not the slightest idea

01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,880
that i

01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:36,239
i have no idea how to change it to like

01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:39,280
not read only

01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:44,000
this is cool though live share

01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:44,000
welcome yeah i wonder if i could um

01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,880
yes i'm joining the live share it's just

01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:50,080
saying joining that's the um

01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,400
i don't know if this is gonna be an

01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:53,199
issue if you're oh well it's just showed

01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:57,280
up now

01:54:53,199 --> 01:55:01,040
so you can see my highlights

01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,040
uh i think you can click on back to your

01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,719
okay well i think where you could see

01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,480
the the list of live shares

01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:10,239
um actually i might just go ahead and

01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:11,679
share your screen uh you should be able

01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:14,560
to enable me to

01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:14,560
have right access

01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:19,679
i'm just doing this here just in case um

01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,719
settings

01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:27,520
manage extension no live

01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:27,520
share welcome page how do i enable it to

01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,400
so it says session details

01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:38,880
that yeah i maybe maybe we can google

01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:41,119
how to do it's a there's a especially a

01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:44,639
live share window

01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:44,639
that should come up with you

01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:49,360
oh yeah down the bottom there we go you

01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:53,520
are anonymous

01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:57,119
oh i can see where you are okay now i

01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:59,520
make read right

01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:00,960
there we go so here we go people we can

01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,040
see

01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,560
yeah i can see it now so we found him

01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:08,719
there he is well

01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:08,719
yes she's there you're a guest

01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,080
all right so i guess i can i can at

01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:17,760
least highlight stuff

01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:20,000
oh that's cool don't make it much easier

01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,239
it's for me to point out things uh

01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,080
for the sake of uh moving things along

01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:28,000
uh speaking of moving things along

01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:30,480
um what were we doing

01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,639
i think we are the message so we just

01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,080
changed this to message here

01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,760
yes so now we're going to have all the

01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:39,199
other stuff to just send

01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:41,199
um a json instead of a string

01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:42,800
yeah so now here what we want to do is

01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:44,880
we're going to make this an object

01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,199
um sorry someone's just asking in the

01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:50,480
chat i'm new here what level of js

01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:50,480
experience does mich have

01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:58,719
02.5 maybe

01:56:54,719 --> 01:57:01,440
like like a tiny bit yeah i mean

01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,239
yeah very very little learning on the

01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,360
job

01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:07,040
learning on the stream right now yeah

01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:10,159
learning on the stream

01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:12,000
um my level of javascript experience

01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:13,440
would probably be i don't know seven out

01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,440
of ten

01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,560
eight out of ten maybe uh it's not

01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:20,560
really showing right now

01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,560
but uh yeah uh so

01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:26,239
the that's dev life learn another job

01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:27,920
i think that's what i like i like this

01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:29,679
bag you can like highlight stuff and do

01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:32,560
things it's cool

01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,800
thank you tech workbench for um showing

01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,719
us

01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,639
this is awesome all right now i have to

01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:39,440
go so we've got the

01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:41,199
json object in there and now we've we're

01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,480
going to remove this string first yeah

01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:43,040
well we don't want to remove it we want

01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,560
to keep the

01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:49,840
surrounded by um curly brackets

01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:52,000
okay yeah so we're going to emulate json

01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:52,880
by doing the curly brackets on the

01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,239
outside

01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:59,679
and then add a key to it um by having a

01:57:56,239 --> 01:58:01,920
colon and be before the high or the

01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:07,840
quotes of the high

01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:07,840
so right here uh yep

01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,679
that is that yep and then before the

01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,440
colon you want to

01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,880
create a key and we can just type

01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:17,920
message

01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,280
message which i don't know if that's

01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,199
going to break anything but

01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:23,040
we're logging the the output to the

01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:25,280
console so let's see

01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:26,880
without doing so there's two ways we can

01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,320
do this we could do it this way which i

01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:29,920
wanted to see if this will work

01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:31,520
and if not we can actually stringify it

01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:34,719
in the json okay

01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:35,280
also like um works messages no better

01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:37,599
way

01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,520
to learn than getting your hands dirty

01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:41,360
as long as we learn from our mistakes

01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,840
and they don't have big large scale

01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,159
impacts that just blow the whole company

01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:45,760
up

01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:49,040
this is why we're not working on github

01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:49,040
source code why would

01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:54,800
that would not be fun imagine that just

01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,920
break everything and then everyone knows

01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,960
exactly who

01:58:55,920 --> 01:59:00,840
did it alright

01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:03,840
cool so we've got that so we'll save

01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:03,840
that

01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:07,599
yep uh save it and then we'll want to go

01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:10,719
to the

01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:11,679
uh the localhost that's running on your

01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:13,679
browser

01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:17,599
uh where we have the console.log okay so

01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:19,040
there's still events coming through

01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,040
yep that nothing none of that would

01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:24,880
change uh it's just a local host

01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:28,480
um we want to see what is uh being

01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:30,560
printed no so

01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,159
yeah just hit refresh oh yeah so we made

01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,560
it we made a change to back in

01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:35,840
uh we want to see what what event gets

01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,080
sent to the front end

01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,080
okay

01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,199
okay and then real quick i'm gonna go

01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:46,960
ahead and start your repo

01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:48,400
which for whatever reason i'm actually

01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,760
not

01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,520
don't need to watch the stream to know

01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,599
who broke everything get flame is the

01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,840
thing

01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:56,880
all right so i sent an event oh yeah

01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,320
there you go um

01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:02,960
so it says now data start event received

02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,960
b-doggy

02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:12,400
that's the data there so

02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:16,080
it just said um star event received b

02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:18,400
dougie that should not have

02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,239
it should have updated to we might have

02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:21,520
to end the server and restart it that's

02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,719
probably what we need to do

02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,320
we're basically getting the same thing

02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,480
we were already getting before so i just

02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:29,440
end the mpm server yeah

02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:30,719
yeah yeah because again this is code i

02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,400
wrote so we don't have any hot

02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:32,800
refreshing or reloading or anything like

02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:37,199
that

02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,199
okay connection is established

02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,840
error

02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:48,320
connection refused to your mp favor

02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,320
flex

02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:55,040
uh yeah no it didn't work and if

02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:56,480
somebody stars and restarts what happens

02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,800
yeah we're getting errors in here as

02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:02,080
well invalid archetype

02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,840
so obviously what we did did not work

02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,760
okay so let's let's let's go ahead and

02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,360
um send the

02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:11,199
json and the way we're going to do that

02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:11,199
is json.stringify

02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:19,520
json okay what does

02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,520
that mean

02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,239
do me a favor and uh just google uh json

02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,239
stringify

02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:30,800
and there should be an mdm doc that um

02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:32,320
explains exactly what that means they'll

02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:37,840
have an example too as well

02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:37,840
an mpm or developer mozzarella

02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:48,800
oh sorry sorry for people getting banned

02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:50,560
um oh it is json.string5.

02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,639
yeah so we want to take that pattern

02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,199
yeah yeah but this is actually how it's

02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:57,040
working

02:01:53,199 --> 02:01:59,920
so converts a javascript object or value

02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:01,599
to a json string and then replaces

02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:05,440
values if a replacer function is

02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:07,440
specified or included

02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:08,719
okay that makes sense so if we go

02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:11,119
console.log

02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:12,639
jason's stringify then we stringify

02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:15,840
whatever

02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:16,480
the thing is that should give it to us

02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,159
is that

02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:20,159
json output is it

02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:29,119
so here oh yeah you're now joined as b

02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,480
oh look at that okay so i just i

02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:32,719
as you were doing that why i had you

02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,800
google is because um i actually had to

02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:35,679
sign into my vs code with my github to

02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:40,239
be able to

02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:44,560
edit i thought so that was on me

02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:48,880
oh good all right so i should be able to

02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,880
uh am i stuck in vim world no

02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:57,920
nice okay you can top things all right

02:02:54,639 --> 02:03:01,840
um so

02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,840
what i guess we could do is

02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,320
here we go it's actually oh i just

02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,320
deleted everything

02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:14,880
and then message like that and double

02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,440
break yeah

02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:19,679
can we do this can you do the same thing

02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:21,280
uh on line 56 but surround the curly

02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:26,320
braces instead

02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:26,320
so here so be json

02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,840
string

02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,639
yep and we should hopefully restart the

02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,840
server and

02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:43,840
see something that's not an error

02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,840
message

02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,480
server starting that is a good uh i

02:03:53,119 --> 02:03:59,040
would think that would just see

02:03:54,480 --> 02:04:00,719
a string now oh yeah um

02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,079
is it sing a string we don't want a

02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:05,280
string

02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:11,760
um but let's get a

02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:14,800
star going star event received b-doggy

02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:18,400
yeah still a string

02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:20,880
it's still giving us um his daughter as

02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,880
a string

02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:31,199
which is fine uh because we it

02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:31,199
so we are actually

02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:35,440
we can just run with this uh because the

02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:39,360
data itself

02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:42,400
is what we need uh in that object

02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:45,040
so if we could do e dot data

02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:46,880
and send that to the to the gif uh i

02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:48,560
think we'll be good on that

02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,920
uh and actually there's even a spot for

02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,040
it too as well

02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:57,040
okay so we go back to the

02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:57,040
here and then we get rid of this one

02:04:57,119 --> 02:05:00,480
uh no actually we don't need that yet so

02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:03,520
keep that there

02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:07,840
uh go to the index.html

02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:07,840
and online

02:05:09,119 --> 02:05:13,199
yeah so let's um actually let's just

02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:21,199
delete 21 and uncomment

02:05:13,199 --> 02:05:23,520
line 20.

02:05:21,199 --> 02:05:23,520
um

02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,000
so delete this one yeah delete that

02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,320
whole line

02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:35,840
um and then we can see if the e data is

02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:35,840
just is just legitimately just a string

02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:53,840
it will be oh yeah everyone's like i

02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,840
received start event received

02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:58,960
um oh it doesn't come up as a thing now

02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:06,560
so i received the message star was it

02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:07,599
star event received okay so let's do

02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,119
this um

02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:12,639
let's just keep keep cause we're getting

02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:14,800
a string as is so we'll continue to um

02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:16,000
move along this path uh we can fix this

02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:18,400
in a second but i just want to get

02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,520
this these words on the screen which i

02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:23,119
think all you need to do

02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:26,159
is on line where is it line

02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:27,040
22 there's an empty quote yeah sorry

02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:31,840
empty string

02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:31,840
we can replace that with e dot data

02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,480
and then if we go into the gif dot js

02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,599
we'll need to go to new gif new gif

02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,840
alert

02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:45,840
is the function

02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,320
no actually so we don't need to add it

02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,440
in because we already have four

02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,760
arguments

02:06:57,440 --> 02:07:02,079
uh the way gif alert is receiving it is

02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:06,000
receiving it as an argument of reuser

02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:07,679
okay and then user we're actually seeing

02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,800
it online

02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:13,440
40 or 74. so we're actually

02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,719
already gonna since it's already string

02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:18,000
we're putting that string

02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:20,159
on uh next to the other string so

02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,040
right now if we do go back to our local

02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:22,880
host our

02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:26,880
i think we is this already embedded into

02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:30,079
our browser source i can't remember

02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,040
hi there i'm a web soccer service yeah

02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:32,880
so

02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:34,079
i just wanted to do that because i knew

02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:34,560
that that would just put it on the

02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,960
screen

02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,960
now we can fix it instead of this like

02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,920
shoving our eyes into the console so

02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:43,199
okay um the high on hi there i'm a

02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:46,480
websocket server

02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:49,520
um i think

02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:49,520
i think this is what we've got

02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:54,480
yeah that's e data um so i think what

02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:58,960
we'll do is probably remove the

02:07:54,480 --> 02:08:01,199
the the um

02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,840
what am i trying to get at so let's go

02:08:01,199 --> 02:08:06,880
back to the back end this is index.js

02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:08,719
um in order to make this work

02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:10,639
in the way that i think we can just get

02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:12,000
it on the screen and then move on

02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:13,920
uh this is not going to be the best code

02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,719
but it's going to be working code um

02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,719
so let's

02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:23,280
wait that's interesting that is there

02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:24,639
why don't we get rid of that message

02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,000
well that's the message that's the

02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,440
message that gets presented when you

02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,520
refresh the page

02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:30,480
so when you first get the to show that

02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:33,360
it's working

02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:34,480
we want to have something there because

02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:36,079
then we don't want to we don't want to

02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:37,679
have a different situation oh hang on

02:08:36,079 --> 02:08:41,679
then well why don't you do this

02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:44,000
if we go to localhost

02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:44,719
if i refresh it should say hi my website

02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,599
server now

02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:47,599
someone stars it

02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:51,679
because that's the current log that's

02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:53,440
the current e data and there's someone

02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:54,400
stars that that should be the new e data

02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:58,639
right

02:08:54,400 --> 02:09:02,320
yeah and so what's this um

02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:05,760
let's remove all that json stringify

02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:07,440
actually let's let's actually just do

02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:11,520
json stringify but only do

02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:12,800
the the string okay oh you know actually

02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:18,079
let's just do this

02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:20,079
we don't have to complicate this there

02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:23,280
we go we're gonna set the string

02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:25,119
uh if you refresh the page now as is

02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:27,520
will uh it just show hi there on my

02:09:25,119 --> 02:09:33,119
websocket server yeah

02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:37,760
no it says hi i'm web server

02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:37,760
uh yeah restart the uh the server again

02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:42,800
how many times does this poor server

02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:46,480
have to restart

02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:48,719
okay there we go

02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,599
hi there always stuck at starbucks good

02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:53,119
touch

02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:56,320
okay so now in the gift.js

02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:57,920
uh on line 74 we're just gonna remove

02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:59,440
that generate title because we don't

02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:02,560
need to

02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:05,599
that was a placeholder that i had

02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:07,280
yeah so that's the like like i

02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:09,199
like we knew they would or whatever that

02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:12,480
the thing that yeah i put in there

02:10:09,199 --> 02:10:14,480
from generate title uh that was the

02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:15,520
my test message the generate title is

02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:18,000
actually so when you

02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:19,199
do a chat message it generates a words

02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,280
on the screen

02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:23,280
so it's a it's a similar like a

02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:24,800
dictionary it's a key value store to be

02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:26,239
able to present a title based on the

02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,320
type of chat message

02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:30,079
uh i can show that a bit towards the end

02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:32,239
but uh for now

02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:34,079
since we can get the user the context of

02:10:32,239 --> 02:10:37,920
the user on the screen

02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:41,280
um i think we should focus on that

02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:43,760
um so now the message the message in

02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:45,520
index.js

02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,599
nerdmon saves time when you're working

02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:50,880
without hot reloading oh interesting

02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:54,480
um i say interesting but of course

02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:57,440
um folks uh actually not folks

02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:58,719
michelle nodebond if you google that

02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:59,840
word that they've thought through in the

02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:01,199
uh the chat

02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:02,639
this will actually get us to not

02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:04,880
actually have to kill the server every

02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:04,880
time

02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:14,320
if we use the mod instead

02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:16,239
okay so that's it there so it helps

02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:17,119
develop basic applications by

02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:19,520
automatically

02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:22,159
restarting the node applications so if i

02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:22,159
go to here

02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:25,840
um

02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:37,760
yep thanks chat it's the little things

02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,960
though

02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,880
so it restarts on save i say so every

02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,719
time i save the file

02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:46,400
yeah and this is one of the the things

02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:47,360
that you get for free when you start

02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:50,880
like a view app

02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:52,159
or a react app um so instead of doing

02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:57,360
npm start you should do

02:11:52,159 --> 02:12:01,199
nodemod instead oh okay wait hang on

02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:01,840
to npm uh no npm just nodemine oh just

02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:05,520
node one

02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:07,360
okay uh actually

02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,840
it looks like by default yeah by default

02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:13,280
it will run nodemon

02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:16,400
run or just nodemon run start is that is

02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:18,360
restarting time started already look

02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:20,719
yeah i think it inferred from your

02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:23,280
package.json uh because we do have

02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,560
them start there so i didn't do a lot of

02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:27,679
ergonomic and

02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,719
setting up stuff but i did do that so

02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:30,800
now we don't have to kill the server

02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:33,840
every time we change the index.js so

02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:35,119
now let's go to indexedjs also thanks i

02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:37,599
don't know who

02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:37,599
that was

02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:42,400
i i come i'm terrible pronouncing all

02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,960
these chat names

02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:47,199
i've been saying plannered uh but even

02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:49,119
though i've been putting you

02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:50,480
even though your uh the r in the end is

02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:53,280
actually reverse in my

02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:54,960
mind but um okay so i'm just having a

02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:58,560
look what else we've got up here

02:12:54,960 --> 02:13:00,960
so the repo name is get twitch

02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:02,320
which is why it's coming up down here is

02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:05,280
that correct

02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:06,800
yes dad repo name so the reaper name's

02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:09,650
up here

02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:11,040
yeah so this is starred

02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:14,159
[Applause]

02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:17,520
on twitch and that would work right yes

02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:18,639
yeah cool yeah and you could even do

02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:21,040
mish banner slash

02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:21,840
get twitch um and then that would show

02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,440
up on

02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:26,000
on the title but also remind that we

02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:28,239
deleted that that title generator

02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,679
uh because it was quite a bit of text to

02:13:28,239 --> 02:13:34,960
get on the screen

02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:38,159
okay cool all right

02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:40,639
so then if we go down to

02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:43,920
um we should be in the index.js now um

02:13:40,639 --> 02:13:43,920
because we need to actually

02:13:48,079 --> 02:13:51,599
yep excellent and uh at this point on

02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:56,079
line

02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:57,920
52 um we are sending the full-on message

02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:01,760
uh instead of sending the full-on

02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:01,760
message we should probably be sending um

02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:06,000
honestly i don't know what we we should

02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
be sending um because i forgot what the

02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:13,840
object looked like at this point

02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:13,840
it's like message not data but a message

02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:18,639
e data is what we get on the front end

02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:21,840
but we should do an e

02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:24,400
data or e data dot message

02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,760
okay so that's what this should be so

02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,599
actually rather than let's

02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:28,800
instead of guessing let's go back to the

02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:31,520
ser the running

02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:33,679
web browser uh we'll look for a star

02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:36,719
event

02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:37,760
and here you go i'll i'll give you a

02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,719
star why not

02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:43,040
i'll just refresh it just in case hi

02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:46,480
there i'm a websocket server

02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:47,199
so you see um yeah i received the

02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:50,800
message

02:14:47,199 --> 02:14:55,280
star event received we actually just

02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:57,199
need to remove um i received the message

02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,840
that's best that's the issue right there

02:14:57,199 --> 02:15:01,840
so

02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:01,840
online

02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:13,369
um isn't it what says received

02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:13,369
[Applause]

02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:23,280
now i think that's actually is that

02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:25,040
built into what we're

02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:27,679
no it's here i received the message

02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:31,040
console.log here

02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:34,480
okay that's funny of index.html

02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:37,840
yeah so we just removed um i received

02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:37,840
the message

02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:42,159
and we can get rid of the dollar sign

02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:50,239
the curly braces

02:15:42,159 --> 02:15:53,840
um to line 12 yeah

02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:55,920
good yep now we should be able to see

02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:56,960
if we're getting indeed what we thought

02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:02,639
we were supposed to

02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:02,639
somebody start a lot of great friendship

02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:05,840
but

02:16:14,159 --> 02:16:21,520
going module

02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:23,440
all right all right did you start uh i

02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:26,960
can give it a star

02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:29,199
now somebody there

02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,320
star event received yeah there it is

02:16:29,199 --> 02:16:32,080
okay so

02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:35,040
now we have the words on the screen now

02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:37,519
we have we'll just keep it as um

02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:39,200
as this uh but maybe instead of star

02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:40,880
event received we can actually change

02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,359
the words to like b dougie start the

02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:44,639
repo

02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:46,319
how do we change that um well

02:16:44,639 --> 02:16:47,760
we just legitimately go up to what was

02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:50,800
it line 12 i think it was like

02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:54,160
well in 12 13

02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:56,399
around that area where we're on line 14.

02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:58,319
so why 4k is for building the uh the

02:16:56,399 --> 02:17:01,679
message

02:16:58,319 --> 02:17:05,280
um here or different files

02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:07,840
uh this is the back end xcoding welcome

02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,840
welcome in

02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:14,000
uh so this is still front end gifjs is

02:17:12,479 --> 02:17:17,120
still front end so we want to go back

02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,639
in index.js yeah

02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:24,000
this is this is html oh sorry

02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:26,399
also still the wrong file that's still

02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:29,840
the wrong file too

02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:29,840
where is it there

02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:37,439
i'm in the right spot yep

02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,439
okay uh so line 14 of this file

02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:42,240
event received yeah so we could actually

02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:43,920
manipulate the

02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,760
the the words like right now it says

02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,080
b-doggy

02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,000
event or sorry not recent it just says

02:17:48,080 --> 02:17:51,800
star event so name is

02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,719
name is what happened the event and then

02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:58,800
payload.sender that's you

02:17:54,719 --> 02:18:02,479
yes so we can actually say like

02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:04,399
be doggy boss

02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:05,599
um hang on i want to see what i want to

02:18:04,399 --> 02:18:09,040
do so what's it say

02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:10,719
it says start event received yeah so i

02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,200
think if we could actually just do say

02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:14,319
um

02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:17,280
b dougie gave a star because i don't

02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:19,200
think we could do um

02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:21,519
we could technically like we might not

02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:25,519
all we not

02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:28,800
we might not always be doing stars so

02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:30,319
but this will work for this one

02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:32,160
yeah but the challenge with this

02:18:30,319 --> 02:18:36,240
hard-coding the

02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:38,479
the what we're receiving um

02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:41,840
might get challenging so like when we do

02:18:38,479 --> 02:18:41,840
this then of course name

02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:55,200
that theoretically should say b doggy

02:18:50,399 --> 02:18:55,200
gave mish manners a star received

02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:59,920
that's theoretically what you should say

02:18:57,599 --> 02:18:59,920
right

02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:03,840
a star i don't know if that's proper

02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:06,960
grammar

02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:11,120
no no it's not but because the event

02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:14,559
is called the name is it's star

02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,559
oh wait it's just star is it

02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:21,439
yeah because that would work then a

02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:23,359
because then it's what then we can

02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:24,800
change what then the events can stay the

02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,679
same so that could be

02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:28,960
b doggy gave mishmanners a star b doggie

02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:31,679
gave mish meadows

02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:34,399
a follow b-doggy gave mish matters a

02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:36,399
pull request uh

02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:38,240
i think that would work yeah let's try

02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:40,639
that but

02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:41,280
the challenge the but the challenge

02:19:40,639 --> 02:19:43,760
though

02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:45,200
is what if this is not mitch manners

02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:47,519
we're hard coding mitch maynard's into

02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:50,720
this and this is why we had the repo

02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:54,160
get generated from the the uh

02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:57,439
variables well actually

02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:59,439
well for this one but

02:19:57,439 --> 02:20:00,479
each person would be creating this for

02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:03,280
their own

02:20:00,479 --> 02:20:05,120
twitch account right yeah but each

02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,080
person would have to go find ms manners

02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:08,160
and change it

02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:09,120
hard code change to hard-coded manually

02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:11,920
so basically i'm just

02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:13,680
yeah i am asking you a uh i'm asking you

02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:17,120
as a senior engineer i'm asking

02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:19,920
you as a junior engineer why we would

02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,640
hard code it basically well because i

02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,200
don't

02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:25,040
i didn't think we could get the the

02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:28,080
payload like this the login

02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,399
of the person who is being starred or

02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,600
can't

02:20:28,399 --> 02:20:32,080
yeah so i think i think what we're

02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:35,040
actually

02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:36,880
i think the the answer is basically we

02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,200
should only just be sending the name

02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:40,240
and we could generate what happened on

02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:43,280
the other end

02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:44,560
in the front end does that make sense so

02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,240
let's just delete

02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:47,840
everything app the plus sign and

02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,960
everything after because we don't need

02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,080
to know it's a star

02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:52,160
we just need to know who we're just

02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,880
getting the payload out there though

02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:55,840
yeah so i and honestly this is what we

02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:57,600
really wanted

02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:59,200
if we get if we do a pull request out

02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,960
into the upstream branch

02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,960
yeah and this is why like anybody can

02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:04,560
fork your fork or you can

02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:06,560
actually merge this to the upstream and

02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,920
then everybody wins so you're benefiting

02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:10,840
the upstream

02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,880
uh the original repo i am a websocket

02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:13,600
server uh that's because we never

02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:16,240
deleted that

02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,720
that's only the high i'm a websocket

02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:20,000
server

02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:22,399
is only in refresh yes it was

02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,120
yeah like totally just get rid of that

02:21:22,399 --> 02:21:25,920
well

02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:27,600
i wouldn't get rid of it because we need

02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,800
to know whenever you refresh that it's

02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:32,160
not someone sitting a star

02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:34,160
it actually is oh okay hello

02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:36,720
so like it would just say like website

02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:38,800
you should say websocket server started

02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:41,040
but i like hi i'm a websocket server

02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:44,240
okay we'll leave it for you thank you

02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,240
all right somebody go start

02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:49,520
i know you get out but i don't know from

02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:52,319
where everyone knows github

02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:54,080
well not quite everyone but make it a

02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:57,120
variable stored in the config

02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:58,560
file yeah and that's what we have well

02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,399
that's what we're doing well because i

02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:01,680
was like well you told me to change my

02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:05,280
secret

02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:08,960
so why is it that difficult then to

02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:10,160
change my name but yeah because that

02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:11,920
would make sense to have it in a

02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:14,240
configuration

02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:15,600
in the future like i would not put like

02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:17,600
right now we're hard-coding

02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:18,720
even in the gift.js we're hard-coding b

02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:22,399
dougie and github

02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:25,840
and the repo like this should i ideally

02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:27,280
be usable by any project any repo so

02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:29,040
like if we had this come

02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:30,560
if we had an open source friday on this

02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:32,640
channel and had like

02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:33,840
view come on like we'd be able to say

02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,439
hey we're just going to change these

02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:36,960
quick environment variables and this

02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:40,240
works in production

02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:43,600
so ideally uh who was it that said that

02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:46,880
sort of yay thanks flanko

02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:48,000
um oh nice

02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:50,000
so we're getting there we're getting the

02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,960
events uh i

02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,640
think what we should do is we should go

02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:57,760
back to

02:22:54,640 --> 02:23:00,000
so if you go back to the gift.js

02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:02,160
we'll probably want to return that title

02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:05,359
now that we have just the user

02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:06,640
okay um so and i think it was line 74 in

02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:08,479
the gift.js

02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:11,200
so i see it we have to change it here as

02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:14,560
well oh so this is a config file

02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:16,319
right so we should have yes username

02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:18,560
so that should be the username there and

02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:20,000
then we can put whatever we want

02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:23,920
yeah so this one should be mishman or

02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:23,920
slash get twitch is really what

02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:35,040
and then um on line 74 we had to

02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:38,000
generate

02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,000
message um

02:23:40,720 --> 02:23:44,840
actually you know what i can actually

02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:47,840
[Music]

02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:47,840
change

02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:57,600
okay yeah obviously forget

02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:59,200
starting a repo yeah what are we making

02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:01,520
that's exactly what we're making

02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,840
so this is a config file so twitch

02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:08,479
handle

02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:10,720
um it looks like a generic app to alert

02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:13,520
on github actions so yes thanks for

02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:14,000
well that you should be able to do it

02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,359
why is

02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:20,160
slack sending me messages

02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:20,160
go away slack

02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:26,000
all right so on line 74

02:24:24,319 --> 02:24:27,359
i'm just gonna add some code back in

02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,520
that we deleted

02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,479
uh because then this is going to give us

02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:33,200
just

02:24:30,479 --> 02:24:34,800
a a fully thought out thought and text

02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:38,160
on the screen

02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:38,960
um and then that way when we do star the

02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:42,000
repo

02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:43,280
which i keep if you think

02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,319
you have screens i've got so many

02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:49,359
screens open while we're trying to uh

02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:50,319
i have one two three four five six seven

02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:54,840
eight nine

02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:56,800
ten chrome windows each with about 40

02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:58,880
tubs

02:24:56,800 --> 02:25:00,960
okay well if the stream goes down we

02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:03,200
know why

02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:04,160
luckily my computer is good enough it's

02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:08,880
yeah

02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:10,640
what github api notifies stars

02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:12,640
uh so if you if you wanted to show that

02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:13,840
real quick um we're using the octokit

02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:15,760
webhooks

02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,040
uh and it's a it's a project we didn't

02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:18,319
really talk about much because we spent

02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:25,680
some time talking about

02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:27,120
uh last last time we were on stream um

02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:29,280
yeah so we leveraged web hooks in the

02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,800
repo but they able to receive the repos

02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:31,200
we're doing a combination of the octa

02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:34,240
kit

02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:35,359
webhook library and then smee to do the

02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:37,600
sort of

02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:38,560
handling receiving and you can choose

02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,600
which events

02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:43,280
we want so just on a push or send me

02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:44,960
everything that happens in the repo or

02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:50,560
we're just doing stars

02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:50,560
i will get every little thing crazy yep

02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:55,680
um whoa

02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:57,920
everything make it everything that'd be

02:25:55,680 --> 02:26:01,520
crazy

02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:05,680
okay awesome so

02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:08,319
i think we have a working product

02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:09,359
which is uh nice to do are we getting

02:26:08,319 --> 02:26:10,800
failures right now

02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:12,720
uh can you double check i'm not seeing

02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:15,760
good things

02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:15,760
it says service dog

02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:21,520
poincare emirate did it as well and yet

02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:24,880
we're still getting

02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:28,080
events coming through ship it

02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:31,439
now mere mortals tremble before

02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:33,359
creation this is the general phase

02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:35,680
so before we do anything else we should

02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:38,080
definitely write a commit message

02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,960
and we should also push this up to your

02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:41,600
branch

02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,800
uh because we have we have success uh

02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,399
and we should be

02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:46,319
looking at this yeah i'm a web soccer

02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:48,000
service dog mishamas don't gitch like we

02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:50,080
knew they would

02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:51,520
somebody stole their ego because that's

02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:53,120
the um

02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:56,319
that's the message for everything that's

02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:56,319
the default message yes

02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:02,399
all right install the rapist all the

02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:03,680
reapers tell the report

02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:06,560
now i can go and style the roof by

02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:09,040
myself plank go star mishmas dot gitch

02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:11,760
like we knew they would

02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:12,880
yay yes so we can change that text to

02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:15,200
whatever we want

02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:16,479
um now the front end is doing all the

02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:18,720
generation of the words

02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:19,520
real quick where is that text change

02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:21,680
like we knew that

02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,960
that's here isn't it yeah so if you go

02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:26,000
to line 74

02:27:22,960 --> 02:27:28,720
i added back in the generate title

02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,319
yeah and then if you look for a generate

02:27:28,720 --> 02:27:34,479
title you can see that

02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:36,080
object or in javascript's an object um

02:27:34,479 --> 02:27:37,520
and uh other places they call them

02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:39,120
dictionaries but

02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:45,840
here's where we're passing in the repo

02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:48,999
name from above

02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:48,999
[Applause]

02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,880
and the other cool thing about this is

02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:56,240
that we're also

02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:57,680
leveraging the so at the moment

02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:59,760
we're actually we're doing a couple

02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:01,439
different things uh we could actually

02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,720
get some chat integrations

02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:07,760
from we don't have to do this today but

02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:09,920
if we change the repo owner to sorry if

02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:12,960
we change the twitch channel to github

02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:16,080
uh if i type in i did that it has been i

02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:18,640
changed it back to github ages ago

02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:20,640
yeah so if you if i so in the github

02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:23,760
chat i typed in yo

02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:25,040
yo is hi yeah so that's another

02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:29,600
integration that i have

02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:31,310
uh in this chat so if you type in pizza

02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:33,520
with exclamation points here yo

02:28:31,310 --> 02:28:36,319
[Music]

02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,319
it should pop up

02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:40,640
is this this shared editor shh

02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:45,520
yes we are sharing through live share uh

02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:48,160
so i could make as many

02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,760
commands here as i would yes and then

02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:51,200
you would basically as you generate

02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:54,640
commands then you can have

02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:58,160
separate gifs um that show up as well

02:28:54,640 --> 02:29:00,960
um it's pretty much it this thing's your

02:28:58,160 --> 02:29:02,880
your own your own little peachy dress

02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:06,000
dish of um being able to

02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:07,520
make integrations on on twitch um

02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,120
but yeah they're all labeled uh you see

02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,399
the sound effects and if you scroll down

02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,600
you'll see sort of how these are sort of

02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:15,920
handled as well

02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,920
yeah okay that's cool

02:29:16,960 --> 02:29:23,200
excellent so now people now the

02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:25,120
the uh the pizza and the yo command well

02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:28,000
actually pizza was topped and chopped

02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:28,240
yo was talked in shot yeah and they were

02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,479
all

02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:32,720
actually trigger some sounds too as well

02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:37,760
um

02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:40,240
is that just just the sounds aren't fyi

02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,720
maybe that's a good thing probably i'll

02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:45,680
just be getting

02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:45,680
flex the whole time

02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:51,120
yeah i actually i think we disabled oh

02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:53,040
there we go line 73.

02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,359
we disabled pretty sure we disabled the

02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:56,000
last time yeah audio play we removed the

02:29:55,359 --> 02:29:57,760
audio

02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,920
yeah so the audio is not playing at the

02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:00,800
moment so um the pizza actually has like

02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:04,080
sparkle sound

02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:05,600
uh they're all sort of labeled above um

02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:07,040
but i think at this point we should

02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:08,479
definitely if we haven't done yet we

02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:10,960
should commit this

02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:12,240
message so what should we do well okay

02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:15,600
here they are this is

02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:19,120
okay so chat

02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:22,399
bot integration works

02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:26,560
with username and

02:30:22,399 --> 02:30:27,840
starring well live shell looks cool it

02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:31,040
does doesn't it

02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:32,479
okay so commit to my branch

02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,840
yeah it should be your branch make sure

02:30:32,479 --> 02:30:34,160
you're not on main yeah i think we're on

02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,920
style

02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:38,000
style changes yep it says down the

02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,760
bottom it's just behind your head you

02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:47,840
can't see it

02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:47,840
and then push to the origin

02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:53,280
that config info should definitely be in

02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:53,280
enb

02:30:55,200 --> 02:31:00,000
yeah yeah honestly um that is true like

02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,479
if we create an amv file

02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,000
um actually that'd be a really cool

02:31:02,479 --> 02:31:06,080
little problem to solve

02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,439
if we if we want to keep on this track

02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:08,560
of doing these live streams with this

02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:09,920
twitch integration we could probably

02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:12,240
make this thing pretty nice

02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,600
uh because i think you now have your

02:31:12,240 --> 02:31:15,120
your bearings around everything and i

02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,960
think i do too as well

02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:19,439
um but i guess what they're what they're

02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:21,520
talking about is like instead of putting

02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:23,840
yeah like because obviously we have the

02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:26,399
env file which you copy and then you

02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:28,399
configure everything only in that file

02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:30,720
at the moment we've got you've got to

02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:32,080
create an emv file with your secret then

02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,760
you've got to go up here and go to

02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:35,280
configure all this stuff

02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:37,200
then you've got to go down here and

02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,319
you've got to configure all this stuff

02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,880
here

02:31:38,319 --> 02:31:41,840
like these commands here so yeah so he's

02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:44,080
saying we should have

02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:45,200
all that configuration just in a config

02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:46,800
file right yeah

02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:48,240
at least these where we were manually

02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:50,240
entering in handles

02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:51,920
um we should have a config file and if

02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:52,720
there's no config like if we haven't set

02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,040
up a twitch

02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:56,000
chat integration uh we should actually

02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,240
just have a default

02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,200
and the default could be github um the

02:31:58,240 --> 02:32:02,479
default could be

02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:05,760
bw twitch but uh we should have a

02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:07,600
like default set um or database which is

02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,520
daryl

02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:11,120
you're adding scope creep basically

02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:13,200
where this you're making this prop

02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:15,120
this project way too complicated uh

02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:18,000
databases are

02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:20,479
a database would be great too as well um

02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,319
but for the sake of

02:32:20,479 --> 02:32:24,000
going through the process of sharing and

02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:25,760
how to build this thing

02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,680
um we're basically doing the simplest

02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:29,439
steps first uh and

02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:30,800
i i didn't mention like part of my sort

02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:32,399
of love for doing these chat

02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:34,720
integrations on twitch is because the

02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:36,640
majority of twitch chat integrations

02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:38,960
uh even the ones that like you can

02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:40,560
leverage they're very complicated

02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,080
uh so if i go to look at the code of

02:32:40,560 --> 02:32:42,880
different chat integrations on stream

02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:44,960
elements

02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:47,200
i have no context of how we got to this

02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:48,399
point and i'm expected to basically use

02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:51,760
this and then if i go

02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:53,120
in and build this uh or like

02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:54,399
build on top of it then i'm like oh i

02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:54,960
had just so much learning i have to do

02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:57,280
so

02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:58,720
i've intentionally kept this simplistic

02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:00,720
where it's all in one file

02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:02,640
uh all the gif interactions the

02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:03,760
index.html is super simplistic the

02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:07,359
index.js

02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:09,040
the backend is just a js file uh

02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:10,479
mainly because i actually want to write

02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:12,000
a blog post about this and do some

02:33:10,479 --> 02:33:13,280
content around it and when you have

02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,720
simplistic stuff

02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:17,280
it's a lot easier to teach when you

02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:19,040
don't have all this extra stuff to learn

02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:21,040
yeah and i think lockwood's right if we

02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:22,560
did a database that requires

02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:24,399
all our people who are eventually going

02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:26,720
to use it to do the same thing

02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:28,319
or overhaul over yeah yeah and github

02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:29,920
doesn't sell databases so

02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:31,760
there's no reason for us to use one of

02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:34,800
those okay i'm

02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:36,800
100 kidding yeah okay so

02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:38,560
do i want to create a pull request now

02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:40,000
or are we going to leave that

02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:41,840
like that uh you should probably create

02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,680
a pull request because we've we have a

02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:45,200
pretty fully functional feature which

02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:47,200
we've fixed the titles

02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,240
uh we we have not styled any changes so

02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:52,080
i think we should

02:33:48,240 --> 02:33:54,399
not name this uh style changes um

02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:56,399
and the pull request title so chatbot

02:33:54,399 --> 02:34:00,479
integration

02:33:56,399 --> 02:34:02,960
yeah basically we functioning title and

02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:04,800
user names uh because it's actually a

02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:06,880
legitimate feature we just added

02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:07,920
um being able to see who who actually

02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:12,880
started the repo

02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:15,600
okay cool so create pull request yep

02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:17,120
and it should go checking no complex the

02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,200
bass branch

02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:21,439
yeah yeah and then one thing that i'll

02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:22,800
do if i can ask you since you're here if

02:34:21,439 --> 02:34:30,080
you can open up an issue

02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:33,359
uh to create a config so um

02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:33,359
uh i'll go ahead and review your

02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:45,840
[Applause]

02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:45,840
questions

02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:54,640
um secret

02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:58,160
username uh what else do we have

02:37:01,439 --> 02:37:04,160
created a pull request and you rejected

02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:07,359

02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:12,720
um no you you could re-request

02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:15,520
reviewers so if you go to the top to the

02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:15,520
uh pull request

02:37:16,840 --> 02:37:21,359
yeah and you look at my face

02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:23,600
yeah see where it has the rejection you

02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:25,920
hit there this is the reese's

02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:25,920
okay

02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:31,680
gerald duck says don't worry he gets uh

02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,040
three rejections a day which is you know

02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,240
that's that means you're doing something

02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:37,200
right you're uh

02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:38,880
you're learning um so is that okay i

02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:41,040
know

02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:42,319
yeah it is the only thing is that um

02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:42,640
there's some white space that i'm just

02:37:42,319 --> 02:37:46,000
gonna

02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:47,760
fix myself oh okay yeah i say that

02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,120
yeah and i did i i probably should have

02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:51,600
showed i showed that one

02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:54,080
once again before i did that but i did

02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:54,080
some um

02:37:54,720 --> 02:38:02,319
i can do it okay cool

02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:03,840
uh but other than that there are commits

02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:04,800
on the remote they're not present on the

02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:06,399
local bench

02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:08,720
yeah that's because i just i just forced

02:38:06,399 --> 02:38:09,920
to commit um from github so

02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:12,240
if people didn't know that you could do

02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:14,319
suggested changes uh and

02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:16,160
as a reviewer you could also for you

02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:18,560
could actually commit those changes

02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:20,160
so there will be one commit from me uh

02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:21,920
on on your branch

02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:23,920
uh which tends to happen this is like a

02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:26,399
super powerful tool because

02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,479
as a maintainer sometimes you want to

02:38:26,399 --> 02:38:30,640
make a quick change that doesn't require

02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:31,840
to go to back and forth again so i just

02:38:30,640 --> 02:38:33,520
did that

02:38:31,840 --> 02:38:34,880
but it caused a little bit of issue for

02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:38,479
michelle she had to fetch

02:38:34,880 --> 02:38:40,640
and then push again i can sort out all

02:38:38,479 --> 02:38:43,840
the issues

02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:43,840
uh i am actually going to

02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:47,120
approve your pr

02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:56,880
and put some exclamation points too as

02:38:54,840 --> 02:39:00,080
well

02:38:56,880 --> 02:39:00,080
and then i'll add a um

02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:03,359
a gif too as well

02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:10,800
all right and then everybody knows i

02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:13,840
like to squash and merge so

02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:16,080
there we go merged pr

02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,280
wow i would say that's a success after

02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:19,680
uh struggling through

02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:21,200
some user error at the beginning i think

02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,840
so too

02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:26,240
can you show how to do the suggestion

02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:26,240
thingy

02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:31,200
yeah yeah i think we could do that again

02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:34,160
um

02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:35,280
yep so don't have to refresh this page

02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:37,280
now

02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:38,640
uh yeah you can refresh your page or i

02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:41,600
think you should be able to scroll down

02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:41,600
it shows merge right

02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:49,680
thanks for doing this yeah

02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:51,280
okay now what are we doing so i think

02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:55,280
what you could do

02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:55,920
is we'll probably have to make a quick

02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,160
change

02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:00,560
and uh to show this off so maybe we

02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:02,240
could do some css real quick to center

02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:03,760
that those words on the screen because

02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:07,040
at the moment they're kind of

02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:11,120
they're wild erratic yeah um

02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:13,760
so let's see we need to fix the css

02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:16,560
let me just look in the the repo to in

02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:21,840
the public that in its html

02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:21,840
there should be a

02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:26,080
oh that's even better i forgot i had a

02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:28,160
css file yeah

02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:29,359
uh which honestly we fixed last week too

02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:31,920
as well we did uh

02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:32,880
i fixed a couple of things um but we

02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:36,240
should just barely go

02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:37,600
center yeah and it should be uh we

02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:39,520
should be able to grab the

02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:41,279
actually we we can't grab it because we

02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:44,800
need to actually create it

02:40:41,279 --> 02:40:47,520
so there is a class called gif

02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,240
um that's not existed uh but we can use

02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:50,560
that

02:40:48,240 --> 02:40:53,200
so if you went to line 30 and added a

02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:53,200
new line

02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:59,279
and just type in uh it will be

02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:04,640
you'll need to put a period before yeah

02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:05,840
got it

02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:09,359
and i think you should be able to do

02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:09,359
text dash align center

02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:19,040
that yeah um

02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:20,399
that should work we just need to um one

02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:22,800
of these

02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:24,240
oh yeah we need to sorry yep always

02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:25,760
forget them

02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:28,840
yeah and then if you refresh a page you

02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:31,920
can see if the text gets centered

02:41:28,840 --> 02:41:35,200
okay look always

02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,800
refresh that's not

02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:38,479
i don't know what i was thinking with

02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:40,560
that um

02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:42,800
that is not actually let's just look up

02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:45,840
css tricks because uh

02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:47,120
i never know what the css is to no one

02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:49,040
knows how to center stuff

02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:51,200
uh but we do have some css grid in here

02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,200
though

02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:56,800
where we i guess we could do the

02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:59,200
justified content we do have flexbox

02:41:56,800 --> 02:41:59,200
item

02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:04,240
um i mean at this point we could try

02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:06,720
anything

02:42:04,240 --> 02:42:09,840
um usually i open up the chrome console

02:42:06,720 --> 02:42:09,840
and then see what's available

02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:15,279
in

02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:19,040
there's a few of them text dash align

02:42:15,279 --> 02:42:21,920
center yeah and then we have our

02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:21,920
supposed to work

02:42:22,960 --> 02:42:26,240
so inside hang on don't think you need

02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:29,520
to apply

02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:34,000
to the gif you're using display grid

02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:37,760
display flex then justify content center

02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:40,319
yeah we are using flex on content but

02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:41,840
we're actually not using content so if

02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:43,439
you go to index.html

02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:44,880
we can delete what we just added in the

02:42:43,439 --> 02:42:46,479
css

02:42:44,880 --> 02:42:49,600
[Applause]

02:42:46,479 --> 02:42:53,120
this will work hopefully

02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:56,000
okay on underneath the body

02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:58,160
in index.html where i'm at you should be

02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:01,680
able to add a div

02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:02,670
okay and that dim should have a class

02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:04,720
called content

02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:06,080
[Applause]

02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:08,479
because we already have the flexbox

02:43:06,080 --> 02:43:12,399
there we're just not using it yeah

02:43:08,479 --> 02:43:15,600
and then we'll close that div yeah

02:43:12,399 --> 02:43:17,840
and then we'll want to um do one of

02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:17,840
these

02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:26,720
oop uh sorry i'm using vem on my end

02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:26,720
and uh

02:43:29,279 --> 02:43:33,520
yeah so if i think we can just align

02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:35,760
that and

02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:37,840
that looks good right sorry you wanted

02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:40,319
it all wrapped in a div

02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:42,160
yeah that's basically what we have um

02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:43,840
and this content in the css

02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:45,279
it actually is already doing all our

02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:49,120
center and aligning stuff

02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:52,319
we just want to use again oh okay save

02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:54,319
and then if we go back oops that's the

02:43:52,319 --> 02:43:58,640
diff viewer

02:43:54,319 --> 02:44:04,160
and refresh nope

02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:06,960
not even close

02:44:04,160 --> 02:44:09,120
but i didn't think we had so there was a

02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:10,399
content class but if we go back to the

02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:14,160
css

02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:15,200
our content class didn't how did it had

02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:19,120
a line

02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:19,120
uh content center not a line

02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:26,399
uh i don't think online text says

02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:28,560
actually i think uh it's the max with

02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:31,040
um daryl's got a he's onto something

02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:34,080
yeah set max with okay

02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,520
uh and i think it's because um

02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:38,000
so the thing is we are inspecting the

02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:39,359
element we can't expect the element

02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,040
at the moment because what we're doing

02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:42,399
is i didn't talk about the code that

02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:43,920
we're actually that powers this

02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:45,840
but it's actually removing the element

02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:47,439
away from the screen every time it

02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:49,359
actually disappears so the inspect

02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:51,920
element will be expected inspecting

02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:53,359
only for 10 seconds until it goes away

02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:55,040
so

02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:57,200
we could potentially use the chrome

02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:58,880
console pause the element

02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:00,960
and then inspect it but that might be a

02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:01,680
little extra work similar to how we were

02:45:00,960 --> 02:45:03,040
doing

02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,479
earlier trying to figure out this

02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:05,600
websocket stuff we've got all the

02:45:04,479 --> 02:45:07,520
centers now

02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:09,520
line content just by content text light

02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:12,800
and then we need to set the max

02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:16,080
width right so is it max dash width

02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:20,479
what is it what should we make it well

02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:22,240
so i'm looking at the because that one's

02:45:20,479 --> 02:45:25,359
that one's that so if we go just a

02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:27,439
thousand that should work right

02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:29,120
um i mean the only way to check is just

02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:32,880
by refreshing the page and looking at it

02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:35,520
check it out nope

02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:35,520
not so much

02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:43,040
container style display flex

02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:44,080
i like that the chat shows up under i'm

02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:47,279
just reading it

02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:49,279
sorry i i do have this working code

02:45:47,279 --> 02:45:50,479
in another repo and i'm just going to

02:45:49,279 --> 02:45:53,200
look at it

02:45:50,479 --> 02:45:54,560
just to try to understand so here's

02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:59,840
position then add

02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:59,840
the hiding container styles display

02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,279
um you know actually we've got the

02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:07,040
content here

02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:08,399
display flex so i i'm actually doing

02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:11,120
this in um

02:46:08,399 --> 02:46:12,319
i'm doing this in the bay box oh yeah

02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,240
yeah

02:46:12,319 --> 02:46:15,840
the bay bot is actually using uh the

02:46:14,240 --> 02:46:18,720
alerts

02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,800
oh dude it's closed oh lords is using

02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:21,040
red and gray does a lot of the magic for

02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:24,000
you

02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:24,560
already the so we could just do it yeah

02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,720
so

02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:28,160
yeah i was i i don't know why i have the

02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:29,279
content there i think i was playing

02:46:28,160 --> 02:46:30,640
around with something else

02:46:29,279 --> 02:46:32,720
let's just leave it and then we'll just

02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:34,800
change this is

02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:36,319
well technically that it's it's what we

02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:38,240
call the business dead code

02:46:36,319 --> 02:46:40,479
card but we'll leave it there in case we

02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:42,479
want to use it for later right

02:46:40,479 --> 02:46:44,160
no i i would recommend deleting it

02:46:42,479 --> 02:46:45,840
because we were looking for a change

02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:47,200
uh so all that code is actually not

02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:50,080
being leveraged

02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:53,840
um okay so let's go check that and see

02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:53,840
if it works now

02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:58,880
nope hmm

02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:00,720
do you think we have to restart we

02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:04,000
shouldn't have to restart the server

02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:04,000
because it's all front end

02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:07,279
it's yeah it's all restarting on its own

02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:09,520
too as well

02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:11,279
yeah are this is not does known mod not

02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:12,560
hot you know actually i think you have

02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:14,800
to restart the server

02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:17,439
okay uh because at the moment the way no

02:47:14,800 --> 02:47:19,120
mod works it's not actually pointing to

02:47:17,439 --> 02:47:20,479
the investor html because that's gonna

02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:22,800
be our static version let's do

02:47:20,479 --> 02:47:22,800
npm

02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:31,439
nope nope i'm completely wrong

02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:31,439
okay oh it could be caged

02:47:32,560 --> 02:47:40,319
how do i remove case just on this page

02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:43,439
uh the way i do it is um if you

02:47:40,319 --> 02:47:46,560
i use command shift and and refresh yeah

02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:50,960
uh r control shift r i think yeah

02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:54,319
no it's still stuck

02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:59,359
and then just shift refresh as well no

02:47:54,319 --> 02:48:01,200
it's still stuck okay maybe we could um

02:47:59,359 --> 02:48:04,399
inspect that element actually i've got

02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:06,080
one inspect

02:48:04,399 --> 02:48:07,680
well that's that's what's weird because

02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:11,200
we we've added some

02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:11,200
i think it's not applying the max width

02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:17,359
yeah can you pop out the the chrome

02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:20,080
console um container

02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:20,080
document

02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:28,880
can you uh go to elements yep

02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:30,319
and then can you also let's get a let's

02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:32,000
get rid of the console

02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:33,760
that's tracking our messages we don't

02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:36,800
actually need that what we need is

02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:40,960
what's squashed up on top there we go

02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:44,399
uh so now we have this um uh

02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:47,600
so this still says gif

02:48:44,399 --> 02:48:50,240
p class gif can we remove can we can we

02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:53,920
remove the uh the gift class

02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:56,560
then there's css up here very cool

02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:58,640
um that's our css that we're just

02:48:56,560 --> 02:49:00,560
messing with um

02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:01,760
so that's that is our css but we also

02:49:00,560 --> 02:49:05,760
deleted the gif so

02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:07,520
and the p class uh inside your

02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:09,359
i guess i could technically do this on

02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:10,880
my end too as well does that die the pay

02:49:09,359 --> 02:49:13,040
costs

02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:13,040
what

02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:23,200
yeah because that's actually so before

02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:24,560
can we just actually go back real quick

02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:27,200
and i just want to explain something

02:49:24,560 --> 02:49:28,960
again this was easier we were applying a

02:49:27,200 --> 02:49:29,920
class to an element we weren't even

02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:32,240
using

02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:35,200
um because the alerts themselves they

02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:35,200
don't get applied to

02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:38,880
they don't get applied here

02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:42,960
no that's where the image is going you

02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:44,479
can delete it because

02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:46,080
you can't delete it because because job

02:49:44,479 --> 02:49:49,520
of the javascript yeah

02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:50,720
where does the image go then good thing

02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:52,720
so the image is actually getting

02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:54,800
inserted uh actually this is a good time

02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:59,680
to actually explain how this works

02:49:54,800 --> 02:50:03,439
um if you if you go down to um gif alert

02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:09,840
give a lot uh on the gift.js

02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:09,840
uh so it'd be line 71 oh sorry of

02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:14,399
so the way this works in the way this is

02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:15,120
why it's kind of challenging because

02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:17,680
we're doing

02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:18,560
again i simplified this quite a bit

02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:20,960
because i didn't want to use a

02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:23,040
javascript library to make this work

02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:25,040
for the sake of explanation but we're

02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:28,880
we're trying to find the container

02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:30,720
and the container itself is defined

02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:32,640
actually good question container is

02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:36,080
defined on line two

02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:38,800
uh and line two is where dot gif is

02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:39,840
so daryl duck was actually correct uh

02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:42,720
line two is where the

02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:43,920
the the gif gets inserted into that

02:50:42,720 --> 02:50:48,600
container

02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:50,640
um so if you scroll up to a line two

02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:52,319
yep we've got some new people in chat

02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:55,520
too hey kitty slayer

02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:58,240
and daniel heart kitty slayer

02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:59,200
again when do i start um yeah so

02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:01,120
basically this is

02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:02,479
this is what's powering putting the gif

02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:06,080
on the screen

02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:06,880
so this is our container um applying css

02:51:06,080 --> 02:51:09,520
to

02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:10,880
all the other stuff was incorrect uh for

02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:12,560
the sake of this

02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:14,160
um i think what we need to do is just

02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:18,399
change alerts

02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:22,160
into that gif so under

02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:26,720
this under the uh the css

02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:27,920
oh sorry under the css uh index.css yeah

02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:31,200
there it is

02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:33,920
so change this to gifs right

02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:35,040
uh i just know the singular uh unless

02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:37,760
was it

02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:38,720
now you're you're it's you're confusing

02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,920
me

02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:45,120
um uh no

02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:48,399
yep there's no yes all right my bad so

02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:51,120
save that save that and we can get rid

02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:53,840
of the alerts on the html

02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:55,840
uh we did didn't we i don't we did no we

02:51:53,840 --> 02:52:01,040
did that

02:51:55,840 --> 02:52:04,560
yep and now let's see okay

02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:04,560
let's see if that works okay

02:52:06,319 --> 02:52:09,439
and now i'm not curious what the uh

02:52:08,399 --> 02:52:12,000
works well

02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:13,520
sort of okay okay well okay centered

02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:16,560
though it's still

02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:18,160
well real quick close the chrome console

02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:20,880
because your chrome console being on the

02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:22,800
side is actually adjusting our width

02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:24,560
so now we can kind of actually yeah so

02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:28,080
we so real quick

02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:30,479
um you can see the width it does get

02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:32,960
ended at a certain point yeah because i

02:52:30,479 --> 02:52:36,160
was adjusting it in and out

02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:38,080
yeah so now we don't now

02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:40,640
uh so now daryl is basically saying now

02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:41,680
the max width exactly so that max width

02:52:40,640 --> 02:52:44,240
is working

02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:45,600
but now we just need to text a line well

02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:48,399
right now we don't have max

02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:49,520
with i think we actually deleted that we

02:52:48,399 --> 02:52:52,960
have width

02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:57,439
so at the moment we're we're

02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:59,760
uh what do we call it

02:52:57,439 --> 02:53:02,720
you just need to align using flexbox or

02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:02,720
grid yes so

02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:07,279
can we go to uh you had a page up that

02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:09,439
was about aligning text

02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:11,600
using grip yeah he's explicitly setting

02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:15,120
it yeah

02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:16,000
this one yeah aligning centering text

02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:20,160
using

02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:21,279
grid uh i have no idea what that says is

02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:23,840
kind of small

02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:25,920
yeah i'm just trying to find that's

02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:30,080
position

02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:33,920
using float uh float would be

02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:35,680
not what we want uh display grid oh yeah

02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:36,240
yes display grid does all the work for

02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:39,920
you

02:53:36,240 --> 02:53:40,640
all right so i think we can remove text

02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:43,600
align center

02:53:40,640 --> 02:53:46,399
we've got display grid here yeah yeah so

02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:49,760
all this other stuff we don't need

02:53:46,399 --> 02:53:51,680
okay now what do we need and

02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:53,120
we can do justify content center is what

02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:55,279
daryl duck is saying

02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:56,440
uh which is what we had up which is what

02:53:55,279 --> 02:53:59,540
we deleted before

02:53:56,440 --> 02:53:59,540
[Applause]

02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:03,520
oh did we we added all that other stuff

02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:07,840
okay

02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:07,840
yeah that's great so that works right

02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:18,880
not so much oops it should be

02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:21,920
actually let me uh let me google this

02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:24,560
the sun yeah so it's still

02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:24,560
aligned

02:54:27,279 --> 02:54:32,960
do you love why is it wait no no no

02:54:30,319 --> 02:54:35,120
what i don't know i was like no don't do

02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:38,479
that come back

02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:39,920
do it for the parent div of gift oh

02:54:38,479 --> 02:54:41,840
the parent of a gift which we don't have

02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:45,040
one right now so got it

02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:47,439
so instead of doing um

02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:48,240
so let's change gift back to alerts and

02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:50,240
then we'll create

02:54:48,240 --> 02:54:52,640
we'll return that div yeah okay i

02:54:50,240 --> 02:54:56,399
understand where that really came from

02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:56,399
uh because we are we are going backwards

02:54:56,880 --> 02:55:01,520
no we don't need a gif the gif's not

02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:03,120
gonna uh not gonna do much for us

02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:04,800
sorry i'm deleting the wrong stuff

02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:06,640
that's right uh

02:55:04,800 --> 02:55:07,920
let's uh delete some of this white space

02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:09,040
too because that

02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:11,120
that's not gonna that's gonna get

02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:14,720
rejected in the code review um

02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:17,200
all right so going back to where we were

02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:18,319
um i'm just i'm just undoing exactly

02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:21,279
what we did

02:55:18,319 --> 02:55:22,399
and we're back to we're kind of back to

02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:23,920
where we started we had

02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:25,840
we had this working but then we had some

02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:27,359
extra code that wasn't working

02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:29,359
and then we were applying it to the

02:55:27,359 --> 02:55:31,600
wrong spot so

02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:32,479
i went to the index.html and added

02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:35,760
alerts back

02:55:32,479 --> 02:55:38,319
to the so that we have a parent div uh

02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:39,760
if you want to show that real quick so

02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:42,800
here

02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:46,319
uh index just one above yep

02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:48,160
yeah so i just added this back in okay

02:55:46,319 --> 02:55:49,920
so now basically what we have here is a

02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:52,080
parent class

02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:53,120
which is alerts that's going to align

02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:55,600
everything that's

02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:58,240
underneath so this is what gets text

02:55:55,600 --> 02:56:02,160
centered or sorry a justified centered

02:55:58,240 --> 02:56:03,279
okay so now if you hit refresh

02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:05,200
stuff should be in the middle of the

02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:07,760
page now

02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:07,760
it should go

02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:13,840
um now i'm just baffled

02:56:14,399 --> 02:56:20,960
that's um that is what we

02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:20,960
what we did

02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:31,920
uh what happened to max with

02:56:28,399 --> 02:56:35,359
me we deleted it

02:56:31,920 --> 02:56:40,960
that is a good question why is gif a

02:56:35,359 --> 02:56:55,520
uh a p tag and not a

02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:58,399
another day we need max with

02:56:55,520 --> 02:56:59,120
applied to yeah what is the width of the

02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:02,160
body

02:56:59,120 --> 02:57:03,279
does the body have a width um up the top

02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:08,560
it just has

02:57:03,279 --> 02:57:11,920
no can you just type in with one um

02:57:08,560 --> 02:57:15,840
uh remove the max width from um alerts

02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:15,840
and attach that to the body

02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:23,840
now let's try that

02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:26,479
no

02:57:27,279 --> 02:57:29,600
hmm

02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:36,160
that was shrinking the line yeah yeah

02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:39,439
remove that from the body

02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:41,760
um yeah this is this is css dot

02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:44,479
git but we don't have a dot git because

02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:47,279
we deleted it

02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:48,399
uh we can create it again so what should

02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:52,319
be on

02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:55,279
that gif dot get should be

02:57:52,319 --> 02:57:55,279
max width

02:57:56,240 --> 02:58:02,160
dot gift sorry yes

02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:05,840
um so max width is there anything else

02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:05,840
that should be on there

02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:18,720
yeah everything that i'm seeing the only

02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:20,319
other thing i could think is we could

02:58:18,720 --> 02:58:24,080
switch the

02:58:20,319 --> 02:58:25,760
the the gif to be from a p tag to a div

02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:29,920
which is not gonna

02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:32,000
uh change much but it will

02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:33,520
um oh you know what you and we're

02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:36,800
embedding

02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:39,520
let's change the gift from a to a div

02:58:36,800 --> 02:58:40,800
so let's go back to the uh index.html uh

02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:43,040
because we're trying to embed

02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:44,240
some other like h1s and stuff like that

02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:46,800
inside of the p tag

02:58:44,240 --> 02:58:48,160
okay um so what i'm gonna do is actually

02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:50,080
just change this to a section

02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:51,680
because i think we could use semantic

02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:55,279
html

02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:55,680
okay and then the p tag we're gonna

02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:58,960
change

02:58:55,680 --> 02:59:02,479
to um

02:58:58,960 --> 02:59:02,479
a div yep

02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:06,080
and let's see i don't think that's gonna

02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,840
do anything

02:59:06,080 --> 02:59:10,319
but at least we can understand what

02:59:07,840 --> 02:59:12,000
we're working on uh 100 vertical width

02:59:10,319 --> 02:59:14,160
and 100 vertical height on the parent

02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:17,279
display flex item center

02:59:14,160 --> 02:59:18,880
yeah we could switch to flexbox but

02:59:17,279 --> 02:59:21,680
display grid should do everything

02:59:18,880 --> 02:59:23,359
magically on its own which is why

02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:24,960
why this was originally using display

02:59:23,359 --> 02:59:26,960
grid

02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:30,399
are you you are using chrome right we're

02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:30,399
not using a magical browser

02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:39,840
well the that fix the width

02:59:36,160 --> 02:59:41,600
does not got it it doesn't do a line by

02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:45,040
default

02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:45,040
uh can you um

02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:52,000
can you uh apply uns the dot gif justify

02:59:49,520 --> 02:59:55,279
content center

02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:57,840
yep display box align items justify

02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:57,840
center

03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:05,760
so that's uh so right now we're that's

03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:10,960
flexbox

03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:14,319
i think flexbox would be great

03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:16,479
but i i was uh under the impression that

03:00:14,319 --> 03:00:17,520
i was on the impression grid did a lot

03:00:16,479 --> 03:00:20,880
more magic for us

03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:23,760
out of the box i was saying like yeah

03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:24,479
do so you need two you need a box but

03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:27,040
she's got

03:00:24,479 --> 03:00:27,680
like a line uh flexbox all works what's

03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:30,560
this

03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:31,600
yeah let's um they need something else

03:00:30,560 --> 03:00:33,520
inside the box

03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:35,439
so this is saying like the dotted line

03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:38,720
is the

03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:40,000
blacks box and then the box is the box

03:00:38,720 --> 03:00:42,240
inside it

03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:43,760
yeah so i i switched it from grid to

03:00:42,240 --> 03:00:45,520
flexbox because we're not really missing

03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:48,720
anything

03:00:45,520 --> 03:00:53,439
oh set the background color to red

03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:58,080
okay um i just did troubleshooting

03:00:53,439 --> 03:01:00,640
yeah that's that's how you troubleshoot

03:00:58,080 --> 03:01:00,640
we got it

03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:05,359
okay that this makes a lot of sense so

03:01:04,800 --> 03:01:08,160
saying

03:01:05,359 --> 03:01:10,399
this is the flexbox the dotted line and

03:01:08,160 --> 03:01:13,040
this is the box inside that's being set

03:01:10,399 --> 03:01:13,040
to the middle

03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:25,200
okay so let's save that then

03:01:21,359 --> 03:01:27,040
align items center

03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:28,800
all right one of these will do it and

03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:30,000
we'll also see some colors on the screen

03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:34,800
too as well

03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:38,160
yeah alrighty no colors

03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:38,160
let's turn off dark mode

03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:47,120
no colors is there something not working

03:01:43,840 --> 03:01:47,120
when we save this file

03:01:47,520 --> 03:02:01,760
that would be interesting

03:01:51,279 --> 03:02:04,720
because yes okay

03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:06,960
well i'm refreshing the cache uh if you

03:02:04,720 --> 03:02:09,760
do ctrl shift r but open up the uh

03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:09,760
chrome console

03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:20,720
vowel to load resource uh

03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:24,000
that is because we don't have a favicon

03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:27,439
the background change that's not okay

03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:30,800
oh no i changed the background

03:02:27,439 --> 03:02:34,720
okay you had uh dark mode on i switched

03:02:30,800 --> 03:02:34,720
it from the dark mode to not dark mode

03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:38,800
probably getting really light where you

03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:41,600
are isn't it

03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:43,359
yeah yeah it's pretty late um i don't

03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:48,319
know

03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:48,319
what in the world is happening here and

03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:52,000
nothing that i would have thought would

03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:53,600
have worked other than like

03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:55,600
restarting the server which i don't

03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:57,520
think is gonna

03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:59,580
make a difference because you can see

03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:01,439
these

03:02:59,580 --> 03:03:03,520
[Applause]

03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:05,120
yeah just don't because we're serving

03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:07,439
static assets

03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:08,960
so restarting the server is not gonna

03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:12,319
not gonna change it

03:03:08,960 --> 03:03:14,240
alerts gif uh can you go to the index

03:03:12,319 --> 03:03:20,080
html are we injecting the

03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:20,080
yeah we are line three it is index.css

03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:24,560
um why don't you go ahead and um create

03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:28,399
a new

03:03:24,560 --> 03:03:30,319
pr and uh what we'll do is we'll just um

03:03:28,399 --> 03:03:32,720
uh we'll drop the pr and if anybody

03:03:30,319 --> 03:03:34,319
wants to do some offline debugging

03:03:32,720 --> 03:03:36,319
i'm sure this is like something really

03:03:34,319 --> 03:03:37,760
quick and i was trying to avoid just

03:03:36,319 --> 03:03:41,520
like cloning this on my own

03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:43,200
and letting you struggle in silence

03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:45,439
uh why i figured it out which is like

03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:47,040
what most

03:03:45,439 --> 03:03:48,640
um most team members would do look at

03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:52,800
this now i can't

03:03:48,640 --> 03:03:57,840
oh hang on so commit

03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:57,840
um let's just go um working

03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:09,760
um

03:04:08,160 --> 03:04:12,000
daryl's like i can fix it easy on

03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:13,680
courses on this stuff

03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:16,640
yeah it's probably something super

03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:19,439
trivial um

03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:20,479
and i i don't understand why the um it

03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:22,160
seems like the css

03:04:20,479 --> 03:04:23,680
is not connecting because even the the

03:04:22,160 --> 03:04:25,279
background color red and purple

03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:26,800
yeah nothing's working that's probably

03:04:25,279 --> 03:04:28,319
just something silly

03:04:26,800 --> 03:04:30,439
i mean last time it was because you had

03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:33,200
the wrong name you had

03:04:30,439 --> 03:04:36,080
style.css yeah

03:04:33,200 --> 03:04:37,439
and it was called index of css so if we

03:04:36,080 --> 03:04:40,800
fix that

03:04:37,439 --> 03:04:44,880
yeah and now we we we have css in the

03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:47,520
in the um i'm not sure uh

03:04:44,880 --> 03:04:48,840
um oh is it um i think it's is it the

03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:51,680
style tag

03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:54,399
link

03:04:51,680 --> 03:04:57,120
all right i'm gonna check one more thing

03:04:54,399 --> 03:04:59,960
and if that's not the case then we'll

03:04:57,120 --> 03:05:02,000
we can bail on this

03:04:59,960 --> 03:05:04,720
[Applause]

03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:05,279
okay create pull request where are we

03:05:04,720 --> 03:05:07,680
now

03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:10,160
um it could be have zero could be

03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:12,560
getting overwritten

03:05:10,160 --> 03:05:14,080
where's that underside okay can you do

03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:18,160
this real quick um

03:05:14,080 --> 03:05:20,880
go back to the index.html um

03:05:18,160 --> 03:05:22,240
and then online was it three where we

03:05:20,880 --> 03:05:26,000
have type

03:05:22,240 --> 03:05:26,880
yeah um let's change this entire thing

03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:30,319
to style

03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:30,840
to rel style sheet i don't think this is

03:05:30,319 --> 03:05:33,920
it

03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:36,490
but do you want to type that in yeah

03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:37,600
actually i could just type it in style

03:05:36,490 --> 03:05:40,479
[Music]

03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:40,479
oh

03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:50,399
okay how's that doing um

03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:51,200
this is changing our our imported style

03:05:50,399 --> 03:05:55,120
sheets

03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:58,800
to uh to a different from type

03:05:55,120 --> 03:06:01,200
text css to um the style sheet

03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:03,359
taro yeah are you saying relative or

03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:07,520
absolute path for css

03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:12,160
um are using relative aren't we

03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:14,960
yeah this is why modern web frameworks

03:06:12,160 --> 03:06:17,840
do all this for you

03:06:14,960 --> 03:06:19,600
can we do the full request well

03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:23,760
attribute for link tags

03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:23,760
is what you need apparently

03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:32,000
uh can you see if anything change in the

03:06:28,720 --> 03:06:32,000
the browser get an error message

03:06:32,240 --> 03:06:38,240
no style attribute no

03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:39,920
oh sorry uh that's right i don't know

03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:43,120
why i put style

03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:48,080
um it should be rel i i was

03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:52,240
i put style but i wanted to say rel

03:06:48,080 --> 03:06:52,240
um i was typing something else

03:06:54,840 --> 03:06:59,439
whoa

03:06:57,840 --> 03:07:03,040
so it was a there was a way we were

03:06:59,439 --> 03:07:06,560
importing the style sheets i don't know

03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:09,600
if that ever worked um

03:07:06,560 --> 03:07:10,800
but that was the uh so all the css that

03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:14,960
we have

03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:16,960
um we got a lot going on right now

03:07:14,960 --> 03:07:18,319
i was like what the heck where did all

03:07:16,960 --> 03:07:19,840
that just come from i don't remember

03:07:18,319 --> 03:07:22,000
trying to do a lot

03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:23,120
well that's the original css and i guess

03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:25,840
it's been broken

03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:26,720
since the beginning for some reason wow

03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:29,040
i honestly

03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:29,840
sorry i need to actually blame real

03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:31,600
quick

03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:32,880
and need to figure out what happened

03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:35,760
there

03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:38,000
uh i might have took a uh took a

03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:40,160
contribution from

03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:41,200
someone can we remove all the background

03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:42,720
stuff now

03:07:41,200 --> 03:07:44,720
yeah so we can start removing some of

03:07:42,720 --> 03:07:47,920
that stuff so move the background color

03:07:44,720 --> 03:07:51,120
and when we start seeing if the

03:07:47,920 --> 03:07:53,200
if anything gets updated so i'd leave

03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:54,240
that center yeah and see if that's

03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:59,359
considered

03:07:54,240 --> 03:08:02,319
um not interesting

03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:03,359
huge yeah so this is the tech shadows

03:08:02,319 --> 03:08:06,319
that i have below

03:08:03,359 --> 03:08:06,800
uh this was um imported code from

03:08:06,319 --> 03:08:09,520
another

03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:11,359
the bay bot itself we can comment out

03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:14,000
the text shadows below

03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:14,640
it's just huge the whole thing so okay

03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:17,600
yeah this is

03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:18,160
this comment out uh from 31 to 40. i got

03:08:17,600 --> 03:08:20,000
it

03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:22,080
i get it uh you should be able to hit

03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,399
command and and forward slash too as

03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:24,640
well

03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:25,600
to comment i have to come in a whole lot

03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:28,319
okay let's just say

03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:29,120
that and that shouldn't be too close now

03:08:28,319 --> 03:08:32,080
we should

03:08:29,120 --> 03:08:32,800
go okay so it's centered on the screen

03:08:32,080 --> 03:08:34,800
but the text

03:08:32,800 --> 03:08:35,920
itself isn't centered but that's all

03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:38,160
right yeah

03:08:35,920 --> 03:08:39,600
so yeah we we we have everything

03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:42,640
centered at this point

03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:45,600
um in the text itself

03:08:42,640 --> 03:08:49,120
um i don't know why it's not centered

03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:51,760
but i think that's the easy fix now that

03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:53,600
we actually have css working on the page

03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:54,800
um you can actually delete all the text

03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:57,359
shadows too as well

03:08:54,800 --> 03:08:58,000
um that's uh we're gonna probably wanna

03:08:57,359 --> 03:09:01,439
yeah we're gonna

03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:03,840
probably wanna put some not so obtrusive

03:09:01,439 --> 03:09:05,840
text on the screen something that blends

03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:09,600
with what we want anyway

03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:11,279
um and uh actually we can delete all

03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:13,279
this stuff this is all the text shadows

03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:15,120
uh key frames animations so we can

03:09:13,279 --> 03:09:17,600
delete all the guidance

03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:20,319
yeah everything all this down here yep

03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:24,080
yeah that's just all my custom css from

03:09:20,319 --> 03:09:24,080
um another project i imported

03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:28,479
there we go so now we have everything

03:09:27,359 --> 03:09:30,880
working i don't know

03:09:28,479 --> 03:09:32,960
why the text is off a bit but i think

03:09:30,880 --> 03:09:37,359
what we probably should do is commit

03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:37,359
what we have i'm not liking that

03:09:39,920 --> 03:09:45,840
it's not liking my well i close bracket

03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:54,880
um i think that's not needed that's why

03:09:55,200 --> 03:09:58,960
really no it really

03:09:59,150 --> 03:10:04,239
[Music]

03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:05,040
yeah uh it just looks like everything is

03:10:04,239 --> 03:10:07,520
just

03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:09,120
oh that's not what i wanted uh it looks

03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:12,800
like stuff's just not all aligned

03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:18,399
with the body

03:10:12,800 --> 03:10:18,399
there we go all right and then we want

03:10:20,800 --> 03:10:24,319
okay let's just

03:10:24,399 --> 03:10:29,040
oh puts it over there i mean it's a

03:10:27,760 --> 03:10:30,960
stylistic choice

03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:32,399
um i don't think we need to display flex

03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:36,319
on not on gif

03:10:32,399 --> 03:10:36,319
um but we could do

03:10:36,479 --> 03:10:41,600
maybe all the things i think we probably

03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:43,279
need to finish it there

03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:44,960
yeah let's uh go ahead and commit that

03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:48,080
because we do

03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:50,640
i think um but yeah so we'll um

03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:52,319
we'll commit this so we don't yeah and

03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:52,720
then push it up to your branch so that

03:10:52,319 --> 03:10:55,279
way

03:10:52,720 --> 03:10:56,160
it's just it's available yeah in the

03:10:55,279 --> 03:10:57,760
internet

03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:59,439
um and then we could actually yeah we'll

03:10:57,760 --> 03:11:03,040
definitely end it there uh

03:10:59,439 --> 03:11:04,720
i enjoyed this because i think we had um

03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:07,359
oh flex direction yeah so we had the

03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:10,800
display yeah i guess that kind of works

03:11:07,359 --> 03:11:14,080
sorry i have just one more

03:11:10,800 --> 03:11:18,000
erratic change coming okay

03:11:14,080 --> 03:11:21,760
display wax and then flex

03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:23,920
direction ah center

03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:25,920
or column whatever it is yeah and this

03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:29,130
basically makes it top down

03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:33,370
okay and then align items

03:11:29,130 --> 03:11:33,370
[Applause]

03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:37,680
yeah back in my previous life when i did

03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:40,880
um no justify content got it yeah yeah

03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:41,920
that one i used to do uh only front-end

03:11:40,880 --> 03:11:44,800
ui work

03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:46,319
uh all this was like pretty like i i was

03:11:44,800 --> 03:11:46,960
doing that at a time when flexbox was

03:11:46,319 --> 03:11:48,960
getting

03:11:46,960 --> 03:11:51,040
very popular uh so i knew all the stuff

03:11:48,960 --> 03:11:52,880
by by heart but it's been

03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:54,479
it's been a while that's why i use

03:11:52,880 --> 03:11:57,520
things like tailwinds to

03:11:54,479 --> 03:11:59,420
do the job for me css

03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:01,279
flex cheat sheet

03:11:59,420 --> 03:12:05,600
[Applause]

03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:08,720
complete guide to flexboard

03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:10,800
oh yeah there we go um yeah it should

03:12:08,720 --> 03:12:14,000
have worked let's have a look

03:12:10,800 --> 03:12:14,319
yeah not quite but it moved everything

03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,160
there

03:12:14,319 --> 03:12:17,359
it's just the actual texture itself is

03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:21,600
not allowing to over

the repo but if you

03:15:46,399 --> 03:15:49,680
your own repo

03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:52,239
or if you sorry if you fork it then you

03:15:49,680 --> 03:15:53,600
