Title: Encapsulating Ruby on Rails views - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2021-05-18
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	With the recent release of version 6.1, Ruby on Rails now supports the rendering of objects that respond to render_in, a change we introduced to the framework. It may be small (the two pull requests were less than a dozen lines), but this change has enabled us to develop a framework for building encapsulated views called ViewComponent.
