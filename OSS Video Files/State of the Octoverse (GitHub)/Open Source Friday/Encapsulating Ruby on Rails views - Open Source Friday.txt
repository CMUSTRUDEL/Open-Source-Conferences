Title: Encapsulating Ruby on Rails views - Open Source Friday
Publication date: 2021-05-18
Playlist: Open Source Friday
Description: 
	With the recent release of version 6.1, Ruby on Rails now supports the rendering of objects that respond to render_in, a change we introduced to the framework. It may be small (the two pull requests were less than a dozen lines), but this change has enabled us to develop a framework for building encapsulated views called ViewComponent.

yeah and i think that that's like isn't

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,839
that the goldilocks

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,040
question for all of us it's like how do

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,400
you like

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,080
i've never done open source before this

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
is my one open source project i've ever

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,799
done

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,240
i i'm looking forward to chatting with

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,679
our current guest who's sitting right

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,440
next to me

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,720
not in the same room but the real

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,560
question is who's joel

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,760
joel do you want to introduce yourself

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
yeah sure

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
uh so my name's joel i'm an engineer at

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,119
github i've been working here since

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,080
2018.

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,400
i work on a team called design systems

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,040
we

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,600
own really it's a system of systems like

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
all the

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
tools that people use to build user

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
interfaces at github

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,520
whether it's mobile apps or

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
icons or we have a css library that you

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,280
can kind of think of as something like

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
bootstrap

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
we have react components and we also

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,480
have what are called view components and

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,360
that's what we'll be talking about today

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,800
um we my main role at the company is to

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,680
work as the lead maintainer

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,280
of the view component framework and

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
basically the corresponding internal

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,479
work around the project

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,600
i invented view component in

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,200
late i guess it was in 2019 yeah and

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
i've been working on it ever since in an

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,560
increasingly full capacity

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,000
it is now my and has been my full-time

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,040
job for about a year but it was like a

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
side project

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
uh when i first got started on it if you

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,080
want to take over and

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
kind of drive and show us maybe the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
demos and what it looks like

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
sure yeah you can uh switch to my screen

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
and i can i can do some demos

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,799
um so if you uh

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,280
this conversation obviously assumes that

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,720
we're you are uh if you all are watching

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
you're somewhat familiar with ruby on

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,040
rails is it's a web framework for

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,479
building web applications um

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,560
written in ruby and uh a

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,040
it uses what's called the mvc framework

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
so in rails applications you have

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
models that inherit from action view

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,079
base you have controllers that

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,560
inherit from action controller base

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,240
but when you're writing templates they

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,280
are not inheriting from any rails

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,000
construct they are

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,040
written as something like an erb or a

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,799
slim file

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
so at a very high level of view

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,000
component is it's a way

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,280
to express your views

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
using objects like you would express

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
models as objects and controllers as

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,840
objects so if you think about it that

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
way at the highest level um

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,599
if you're familiar with react a lot of

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,560
the work we've done on view component is

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
a direct inspiration of working in react

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,000
so what we've really kind of

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
our philosophy on the project has been

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,599
react is doing all these great

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,120
cool things and it's causing some people

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,680
to want to use react instead of

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
the traditional rails view stack um so

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
how might we take some of those cool

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
ideas

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,879
and bring them back into rails in a way

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,080
that makes sense for the framework

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
so view component is kind of uh i would

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
call like a

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
it's a hypothesis that we can take some

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,280
of those react

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,800
center id centered ideas and introduce

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,560
them into rails applications in a

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,680
server-side rendered context

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,239
so i can give an example of what that

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
looks like um this is the

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,840
viewcomponent.org website

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
when you build a view component it

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
really is two files so we can look at

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,080
this example here i'll make this a

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
little bigger

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,319
um

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,319
so a view component is really two files

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,959
uh it's a ruby file

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
and a uh and a traditional template that

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,319
sits right next to it

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,440
so you can do ruby object things you can

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,799
have a

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,080
an initializer you can include modules

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
you can do all sorts of things you can

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,959
have private methods

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,640
uh all the things you know and love

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,680
about working in ruby you can do in view

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,159
components

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
and then alongside the ruby file you

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,760
have a template that looks fairly

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
traditional

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
and then together what you end up doing

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
with the view component is you

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
instantiate it and you pass it to

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,159
railsrender method

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
this is a change that was added to

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
rail61 that i get have contributed to

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,200
the framework

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,720
um so you instantiate a ruby object

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,680
and you pass it into render and then uh

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
it returns the rendered output from uh

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
from the template based on the arguments

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
you passed into the ruby object

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
um that's kind of what a view component

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
looks like in a nutshell it gets much

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
more complex

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
from yeah it can but that's the gist of

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
it yeah yeah

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,479
it's interesting to hear that um the

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
inspiration itself uh

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
came from the way react sort of decided

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,639
to do their components

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,919
and i think react's component archit

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,520
like basically the idea

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,199
or the hypothesis for how to leverage

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,560
components have kind of spread in other

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
javascript frameworks so it's cool to

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,520
see

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
this here in the the render method uh

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,960
but also super cool to hear that github

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,720
contributes back to

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
uh rails itself too as well because we

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,520
do build a lot of our platform

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
on rails yeah we have a significant

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
amount of contributions of the framework

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,199
it kind of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
even just for this feature i think i

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,759
probably landed

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
eight prs in rails it wasn't in the end

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,720
a lot of lines of code but it was

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
you know significant changes that

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
allowed us to do this without

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
doing what's called a monkey patch where

00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
you just like basically go in and

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,759
rewrite

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,000
part of uh part of rails like in your

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,520
own application that was pretty messy

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
we do have that monkey patch if you're

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
using like an older version of rails so

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
this

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
one really interesting aspect of this

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
framework is that we have implemented it

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
in a very backwards compatible fashion i

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
think that we

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
are fully compatible or mostly

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,759
compatible with rails five two

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
and we're currently on six one which is

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,520
several significant releases apart at

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,320
this point

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,600
yeah very cool yeah and uh uh damian

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
burke mentioned that he didn't

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
appreciate re

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,960
react until he solved view components

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,720
so uh that's pretty cool to hear

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
yeah it's it's been really kind of

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,400
poetic because like

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
what's been really fun is that because

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,919
we're trying to take ideas from react

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,440
and bring them into rails

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
we're ending up with that kind of

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
dynamic internally at the company so

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
like

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
on my team we build view components that

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,520
people then reuse throughout the company

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,639
that's the prime review components

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
library

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
and we also have a team that builds the

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
react components that you just said

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
you're familiar with

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,440
uh from your demos yeah but we actually

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
have a lot of collaboration between the

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,600
two teams and like

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,400
trying to make our apis like named this

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
like feel

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,919
the same way so that like if you were to

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
drop into our our rails stack that you

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
would be right at home

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,960
uh even though you're using a different

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,639
technology yeah that's great to hear

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
and uh folks it seems like people are

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
really digging this uh

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
so far so if anybody has any questions

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,360
on the approach or

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,880
how we implement this at github uh joel

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
is here as an engineer at github

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
and is happy to address any questions as

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
well

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,560
uh which is the one question why twitch

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,400
uh

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,199
because because you're here that's why

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,199
we're using twitch

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
i i see another comment from damian

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
about how widely used our view

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
components in the github browse app i

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,440
can speak to that pretty specifically

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,639
awesome chat about that um so we use

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,080
view components a lot like i

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
i get this question a lot and people are

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,440
often like this seems like kind of like

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
bleeding edge like

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,680
how much are you actually using this and

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
our adoption is very significant i can

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
give you an idea our application has

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
about

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,919
4 800 templates in it about

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,599
40 of those templates render a view

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
component

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,039
so a good chunk of our application i

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,479
would guess that at this point you can't

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,919
really load a page in the application

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
without using a view component in some

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,080
fashion

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,680
um we also have

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
that's in terms of how they're used in

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,160
terms of how many view components we

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
have

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
i think we have about 550 that we've

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,880
written just inside the github

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,800
application

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
um we also then have the open source

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
ones primary view components and i think

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,000
we're at like 40 or 50 there

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
okay so it's a lot yeah yeah yeah and it

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
what was the um i guess here's a

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
question that i have for you which is um

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,639
the adoption like was it an easy pill to

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,400
swallow for

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,919
and so there's a reason why i asked this

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
question i'll get to the adoption for

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
engineers at github because a lot of

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
folks were rendering templates

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,120
differently

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,720
um we went through this with graphql

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
like a lot of people didn't want to use

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
the

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,440
the data through graphql but also

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,879
popular uh opinion from

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,319
dhh um he's always had very interesting

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
opinions about things like react but

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,599
also

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,360
the future of ruby on rails so like what

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,240
was the sort of adoption and how was it

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
sort of

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
taken from engineers when we started

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,319
doing this a couple years ago

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,280
yeah i mean i think that there's been a

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,720
couple

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
interesting aspects of the adoption that

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,759
i can speak to one has been that

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,479
we had an existing abstraction that uh

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
served a similar role called view models

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,039
which are basically the presenter

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
pattern where you have like an object

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
you instantiate

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
and you pass down into it and then it

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,399
exposes some methods and but you just

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,240
pass

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
that one object into a template and it

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,640
interacts with them so it's kind of like

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,160
just the ruby part of a view component

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
and not the template part like it's just

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
this top

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,360
um this top bit and not this bit

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
so for a lot of teams the path was

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
pretty simple

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
to just like take existing view models

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
and convert them into view components

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,519
and the reason that was important for

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
these teams that like really drove

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
adoption was that when you test a view

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,160
model you're generally testing the

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,519
instance methods so you could

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
imagine if this was a view model you

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
might have a method that's like

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
def title so when you would test that

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,240
view model you would assert that

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,240
title is equal to you know like my title

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
and as a string or something like yeah

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
um the different the problem is though

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
is that

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,399
that doesn't actually make sure that

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,120
like what you rendered on the page is at

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
all correct

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
like what you're showing to users is

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,760
correct um and typically in rails you

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
would do that with like a test where you

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,519
open up a browser and like look at the

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,959
page and be like okay did it render that

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
text

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
since view components output html we

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,200
write our tests against

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,080
rendered html and not like just a method

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
call so we

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,279
say hey i render i can actually just

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
show this in a test here yeah

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,000
um let's go into testing so

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
this is what exactly what a view

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
component test looks like here

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,360
um because it's a little bigger um

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
so you can see that like we can

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
literally call do a render call this

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
render and line helper we provide in the

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,720
library or in the framework

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
and then we can run we we you can use

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,839
the capybara

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,120
assertions against it and these are the

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,880
assertions that you typically would use

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,760
in like a browser test but because we

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
have

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,440
rendered dom output you can just write

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
effectively

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
what looks like almost like a controller

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
test or a request spec

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
without spinning up a browser without

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,079
going through the whole like uh

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,959
rails controller stack sounds like we

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,959
have a guest back

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
excellent are you coming in from coming

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,519
in live from uh

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,440
live from my ipad man oh my goodness my

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,760
i have never seen a computer

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
break this badly as it is right now

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,720
nothing is working

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,800
the there was one question oh so damian

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
actually and he previously was the one

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,519
that was had the revelation about react

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
and using react uh or using components

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,240
or

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,600
basically paying attention to it which

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
is his question is

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
how do other view components interact

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,680
with primer view components

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,519
um are there are they using inheritance

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
are you combining them in templates or

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,519
some sort of component objects

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah yeah that's a great question uh

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,839
composition versus inheritance is a

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,360
classic

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,040
oo uh question um so we do composition

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,600
is the one is like the one sentence

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,839
answer

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
uh but i can maybe provide a little more

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,880
color about how we think about it which

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,320
is that it's really

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
we think of components as falling into

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,079
one of two specific

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,720
approaches uh one is components that are

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,920
specifically related to a domain concept

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
from an application

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
so for example in the github application

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
we have a repository model

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
so you could imagine we might have like

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,760
a repository

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,920
title component or like a repository

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,160
card component that like shows a

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
a little summary of a repository as a

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
card

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
those are what we call like domain

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,519
specific components

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,639
those are none of those are open source

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
but then we write a second kind of

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,240
component which is the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
prime review components which are the

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
opposite they have nothing to do with

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
the domain but they have to do with a

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,399
certain design

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
pattern so one example would be like a

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680
uh

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
like a blank slate component which is

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
the component we display when like a

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,880
page is empty

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
that has nothing to do with any specific

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
domain

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
uh with any specific domain model so you

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,600
might have a

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,519
repository blank slate that

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,040
wraps the primer blank slate that

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
composes over it

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,720
so what we end up having is we have a

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
lot of domain specific components that

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
under the hood use one or more of the

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,320
primer view components

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,880
uh to build up the design

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,519
okay cool yeah we do a ton of that

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,279
that's like

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560
that's basically how we do it and and so

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,079
whenever we have a generic component

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,720
that isn't coupled to a specific part of

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
the domain

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,760
we put it in primer and open source so

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,720
what you see in the prime review

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
components library

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
is all these patterns that we've

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720
realized have nothing to do with

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,279
any specific domain model at github and

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
it's

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,279
our really just general purpose okay

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,399
awesome there was a question before that

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
too about storybook

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,720
can you put view components inside of a

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,600
storybook

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
you can't yeah uh those actually this is

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
open source friday this is a great open

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
source friday story uh

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
uh contributor uh one of the

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
contributors to the framework

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,200
his name is john palmer who lives in

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,360
boston uh he

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
i believe he actually contributed the

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
change to storybook to allow

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,800
server rendered components and then

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
wrote a

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,160
gem you can use with view component to

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,680
use it with storybook so for prime

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,519
review components if you go to the

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,160
primary duponts docs

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
we have storybook integrated i believe

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,800
you should when you go to like a

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,240
component be able to click like view and

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
storybook and it will send you to the

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,240
storybook url

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
okay excellent um yeah i'm definitely

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
gonna check that out

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,959
as well um is that um that's actually a

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
a great story as well you were 100

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,320
correct on that

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,000
uh one other thing that came up actually

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,760
we're sort of caught up on questions

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
but uh the point where you dropped off

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,000
was with the mysql

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,279
um or mysql uh and testing view

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,560
components

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,680
yeah so the the thing that we've i mean

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,920
we could have done this with view models

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
if we wanted to but we but what we built

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
is a testing harness around

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,360
rendering two components that counts the

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,480
number of queries that have been

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,279
executed uh in the request before

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,959
and after a view component is rendered

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,360
and if that number is different

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,279
uh internally we require you to register

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,680
that with your in your test to say like

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
this test makes three database queries

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
and that's not something that we

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,360
previously had for writing view code and

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,800
it's really

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,120
enabled people to recognize like uh

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
like be forced to recognize that their

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,079
view code has

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
database side effects which in the rails

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,519
context is generally not a good thing

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,720
like it's it can be okay sometimes but

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
it's something you want to be aware of

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
you don't want to do it

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,160
without knowing you're doing it um and

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,920
that tooling is like as you can imagine

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
catches things like n plus ones like if

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,920
you

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,360
have a component that you pass ten

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
things into and you all of a sudden it

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,600
tells you you have ten queries you're

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,360
like oh

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,440
i have an n plus one okay excellent

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
um so i mean the questions just keep

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,839
coming too as well

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,519
people are great um is there plans

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,120
and i i might not know the answer

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,680
already but is there plans to merge this

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,360
in the

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,519
uh actual rails uh i think that there

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,720
are what i would call intentions yeah i

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,680
wouldn't say there are plans

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
uh our our desire for the framework all

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,440
along has been to

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,320
figure out what the future of rails

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
views should look like

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
i don't know for there yet like we're

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
certainly

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
learning a lot through this project and

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,320
we've seen a lot of benefits inside the

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,079
company

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
the the real long-term question is like

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,680
is this the right thing for rails in

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
general or is it just a good tool to use

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
in certain cases

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,440
yeah um our intention design wise though

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
has been that it will be something that

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,920
we will keep as close philosophically

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,279
and like api design wise with rails so

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,600
that like

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,959
you know say we land on v3 or v4 and

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
we're super happy with it and the

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
community is happy with it that it will

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,600
be an easy sell

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,839
that it will be like an easy migration

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
into rails um

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
in its current state though i don't

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,160
think it's ready the main reason is that

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
when you use view components it's like a

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
separate folder like rails applications

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,279
all have a view folder

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,880
and this is different and i think that

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,240
that would be really confusing to news

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
new rails developers like you wouldn't

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,759
want them to come into a project and be

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
like wait what do i put in views what do

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,720
i put in components like

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,000
what's the difference like yeah rails

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
doesn't give you two ways of doing

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,880
models or two ways of doing controllers

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,800
you want yeah yeah yeah

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
it's it's it's breaking the convention

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560
of of the current

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,079
state of rails i guess uh which i could

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,320
find

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,839
if this is where this would make it to

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
you know upstream rails

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,440
and as part of like what comes with

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
rails new it had to be a lot of

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,959
decisions and perhaps have to come

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
i think rail seven is here and have to

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
come as like a rails eight thing well

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
this is what my thought is is probably

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,560
would like we'd want to wait until this

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
is a thing

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,039
and convinced that more than just github

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
or other large companies are

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,400
going to be able to benefit from this

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
which is my question

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,600
who else is using the view components at

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,600
the moment

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,640
i mean this is honestly the paradox of

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,720
open source

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
yeah it's so hard like so like we build

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,240
this project we have over 100 people who

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,280
contributed to it

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,600
the used by on the sidebar says like 500

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,039
but that's only open source yeah so yeah

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,960
if you scroll down to the side like you

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,480
see

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
yeah there's over 500 used by and we

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
have over 100 contributors like

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,080
i know and i've spoken to some people

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,640
privately like

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,400
um because you said oh dfe is probably

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,799
the coolest one that's the

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
uk government department for education

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,120
okay

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,799
they're they they're using it and they

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,360
actually have their own like view

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,720
components library they they publish

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,039
um but i actually

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
it's tricky because like i can't i know

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
some places that are using it but like

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
it's been told to me in confidence like

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
a lot of people a lot of companies they

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
don't talk openly about their tech

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,160
stack and i respect that like that's

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
their decision here

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,720
um but yeah it's it's proven

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
it's proven pretty popular in the

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
community i think we're at like almost

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
2000 we're going on 2 000 stars now

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,400
like that have you seen any of the

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,559
design systems or theming

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
providers that are using view components

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,679
as well

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,520
yeah i've heard of a heard from a couple

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,600
people that are doing it there's one

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,600
i can there's one financial services

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,919
company

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,280
that is using it um they've built an

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,799
internal design system and they're using

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,919
it in like 20 rails apps or something

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,320
like that which is amazing they're

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,919
actually

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
reusing their design more than we are at

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
github yeah

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,559
uh yeah there's a there's a lot of

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,240
people doing systems

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,160
i think someone started to build a

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
bootstrap view component implementation

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,000
but i don't think they finished it

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,600
um what i've been hearing from people is

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,960
that generally people do this is an

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
internal thing kind of like

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,559
we basically open sourced our internal

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,760
view components but a lot of people are

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
doing kind of what you see in primary

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,120
components i get a lot of questions

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,360
i get almost as many questions about

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,480
that repo as about the framework

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
because a lot of people are at that

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
point where they're like okay we want to

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
do the same thing you're doing for prime

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
review components like

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
what have you learned like what you do

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
what would you do differently that kind

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,760
of thing

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,120
yeah yeah that's it i mean that's

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
fascinating to hear that too as well

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,720
because the

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,799
uh i think it sounds like a lot of folks

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,320
are trying it out uh regardless if they

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,280
publicly talk about their tech stack and

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
stuff like that

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,480
um but it's got to feel pretty good

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,240
though to have an idea

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,400
have it get some adoption at the company

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
you work for and then get adoption

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,440
and other companies and other developers

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,720
sort of like leveraging it

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,240
um my question is like what what was the

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,679
sort of um

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,440
basically what was the the point that it

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,000
actually started taking off and getting

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
adoption

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,799
you have to yeah i guess that's my

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
question to you

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,400
oh gosh it's the thing is it's been such

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,240
a slow boil

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,799
yeah like the temperature has been

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,120
rising slowly since like

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,440
gosh i put i i built a prototype in

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,880
december 2018.

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,799
it's been a long time that's that's a

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,679
long time in technology

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,679
uh i mean it started out as a little

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,720
prototype we tried it a couple places i

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
worked on it with

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,799
uh aaron patterson tenderlove uh worked

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,000
at github at the time and he provided a

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,240
lot of the like

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
really core like technical underpinning

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,080
work at the beginning

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
um and we just kind of did a it's been a

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
really

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,760
honestly a slow process um

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
it hasn't been like some like overnight

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
switch um we've

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
we've attacked it in many different

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,280
directions like some of it was

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,640
at the start it was really curiosity

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
driven it was like we're doing it and

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
some people the company would see we're

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
doing it they're like oh cool like

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,440
this looks fun i'm gonna go using some

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
ice um and honestly that was all we

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
could handle for a long time

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
because we were still figuring it out we

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,159
didn't want

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
20 teams to adopt this pattern if it

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,919
wasn't good

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
so it was like okay the the level of

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
curiosity was

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
well aligned with our level of attention

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,480
we could give the project

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,520
and honestly that really hasn't changed

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,039
it's just that there's been more

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,480
curiosity and there's more people

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,640
working on it like

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,679
we now have depending on how you count

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
it for

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,320
people working on it full-time um

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,919
plus many other people who are like

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,840
strongly involved in the project both

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,520
in the community and at github that are

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,559
just like they make contributions here

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,919
and there

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,880
um but it really has been like

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
fairly organic there there was one point

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,240
where we

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
i specifically asked for a team for like

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,600
last summer we went through and we did a

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,000
bunch of refactors like we spent like

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,640
two months

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,480
doing refactors but that was that was

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,799
maybe the one like truly intentional

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
like

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,240
migration roll out time we've had yeah

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
yeah that's pretty cool too as well and

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,600
do you think the slow burns

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,799
are slower the sort of slow rise of

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,480
temperature has a

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,159
anything to do with the maturity of

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,880
rails yes

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,159
in the ecosystem it's the maturity of

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
rails it's also the maturity of github

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,400
github is a 14 year old rails

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,320
application

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
like yeah we're we're in it for the long

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
haul we're the way we think about

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
maturity

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
has to be different than like a startup

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,039
that's building something new

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,880
um you know we have all this code that

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,320
is what i like to call revenue code not

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
legacy code we have a bunch of revenue

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,280
code that

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
exists and needs to be maintained and we

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,400
need to make engineering decisions in

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,039
light of that fact

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,320
um so that to me changes the time

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,559
horizon i operate on

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,640
i operate on like a five year time price

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,080
when i think about my work i'm not like

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
what's the new hot thing we can ship

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,440
today let's get let's like

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
experiment with this thing and get it

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
out tomorrow like we need to be much

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,000
more intentional because

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,640
everything we do just gets magnified

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,039
over this gigantic rails app like

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
nothing is small uh once it becomes

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
mature here

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
i mean i think that one of our core

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
engineering philosophies here is that we

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,000
try to

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
we one of the things we optimize for is

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
the ability for people to come into the

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,520
company be productive in the application

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,520
like

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,799
for a long time we made it the goal that

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
every new engineer made a production

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,360
deploy in their first week

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,440
and to have an engineering organization

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
and architecture that enables that

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,960
requires you to use i should say

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,720
requires but like pushes you towards

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,240
using technologies that are more

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,320
public than private so we learned a big

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,840
lesson with our use of rails we were on

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,440
rails fork for a long time

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,679
uh many people who are watching this are

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
probably familiar with uh either

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
chantel's

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,320
uh talk on how we went from a rails fork

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
to being on rails maine um

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
but having seen that like i literally i

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
think she gave that talk

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,080
the spring i gave my railsconf talk at

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,039
in minneapolis i think she gave that it

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,320
was the same

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,799
same one so that is a really important

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,360
context for why we open sources project

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,200
very early on was that we didn't want to

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,840
end up in a situation where

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,480
we were developing this this project in

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,480
a vacuum

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,039
and i will say that like honestly

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,159
working with the community like the the

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,919
we've gotten some incredible

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
contributions that like we would have

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,760
gotten to eventually but i would guess

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,159
that we are

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,960
twice as far progress wise in the

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,320
framework

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
than we would have been without it being

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,799
open source it's been like a really

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,520
cool like i think the term win-win is

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,360
cliche

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,679
but it really has been that kind of

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,600
situation where like

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,120
we have benefited from a company from by

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
open sourcing it and the community i

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,679
believe has benefited quite a bit by us

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,360
doing the same

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,559
so it's very mutual yep there you go

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,320
so you can see that has a little banner

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,360
it says uh this component uses

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
javascript

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,039
so if you you can actually we can

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
actually uh check two things off the

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,200
list at once there's a storybook link

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
there if you want to

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,120
view the storybook so here is our

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,480
storybook

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,600
yep i haven't really tested this one but

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
let's go to clipboard copy

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
yep so if you click on that i don't know

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,240
if the i don't know if you have the

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,640
behaviors working here yet this is still

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
pretty

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
uh experimental yeah it looks like the

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
um the behavior is not

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,440
active yet yeah it's not actually there

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,039
yet never mind so

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,520
but just basically this component when

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,039
we use it in uh it has a site

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,760
it has a sidecar asset um okay so we use

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,159
it for that

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,760
and then we are currently in the process

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,600
of building out our practices around

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
doing that internally in our application

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,080
too

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,120
um that's for javascript

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,480
the the this is a great segue into

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,240
uh contributing to the project if you go

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
to github slash view component and go to

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,840
the

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,360
pull requests um

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,480
you can see if you scroll down there's a

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,159
css encapsulation pr it's

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,440
877 i think

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,600
seven seven six seven seven yeah yeah

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,279
um it's amazing you have that in your

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,159
head but you actually been working on it

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,360
since march so

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,039
yeah yeah so so this is a proposal we're

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,240
working on this is actually

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
quite out of date at this point because

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
we've kind of gone back to the drawing

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,400
board internally

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,320
but one of the things we're looking at

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
is you know you know i said we were

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,799
taking ideas from react and putting them

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,919
into rails

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,240
yeah um one of those ideas

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,840
uh well let me take a step back we

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,240
purposely started with the ideas and

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,919
react that were

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,279
non-controversial very easily ported

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,880
into rails like just

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,400
we're really kind of hitting us over the

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
head that was so clearly like a good

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
idea

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,400
yeah we've crossed a lot of those off

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
though at this point so now we're

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
starting to look at some ideas that

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
we're like

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
i don't know like maybe this will be a

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,320
good idea maybe it isn't um and one of

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,720
them is css and javascript so a lot of

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,679
uh a lot of react applications today use

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,400
css and js in some form whether it's

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,600
emotion or any of these other frameworks

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
um

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
so we started to experiment with trying

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,400
to

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,760
solve the same problems in rails so the

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,520
problems are like

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,960
encapsulation of styles like css is

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,840
global by default

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,120
it's a mess you can only those folks

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,440
watching the stream can probably only

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,440
imagine the madness that is

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,799
14 years of custom css having been

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,120
written at github

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:55,520
like um that's a lot of

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,960
it's it's just a lot of custom css so so

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,000
one of the things my team is responsible

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,679
for is like

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,360
really the technical data around that so

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,279
this is this work

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,559
is looking to see what ideas from the

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,440
css and javascript

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,440
landscape we can bring two rails through

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,000
view components and the

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
the thing that css and js ultimately

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,039
gets at is that you

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,799
are writing css alongside your component

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,880
and because you do that you can do some

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,720
programmatic guarantees you can say

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
i'm always going to scope these css

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,200
selectors

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,000
based on like a hashed identifier of the

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,919
component

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
so you'd never get global scope for your

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,360
css yeah

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
um it's kind of like the well i guess a

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,600
lot of the

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,679
the generator generated css and js

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,120
like generates that in your uh your css

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
so um yeah

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
folks if you're familiar with like style

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
components or emotions yeah that's easy

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,840
and that's what we use the reason we're

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
into it is that that's what we use on

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
the react side the uh on primer react

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,840
reason style components

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,200
okay so we're starting to really what

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,399
we've been doing with this that i think

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
is fun is that like because we're on

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,600
such a long time horizon what we're

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,080
doing is we're saying okay

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,279
react has spent seven years in this

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,799
space now at this point

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,279
yeah what have they learned and how can

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,279
we

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,720
like take those learnings and apply them

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,559
in the rails context so

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,080
one one thing that's like been really

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,080
sticky about this is that

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,159
a lot of the css and js work was done

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,480
like architecturally philosophically was

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,399
done before css variables work

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,520
yeah so so we're now over trying to

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,880
figure out this like

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,919
it's 2021. github at least

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,000
internally from our engineering

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,440
practices we assume the existence of css

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,120
variables we use them we use them for

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,200
dark mode for example without css

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,520
variables

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
we assume that they are available as a

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,600
technology for us to use

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,080
given that fact how much of the css and

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,520
javascript learnings really still apply

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,760
we don't know so we're trying to like

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,600
reconcile like the current technologies

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,159
with like the lessons from

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,799
from react and put them into something

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,559
that works

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,880
we do actually run something like this

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,320
in production today it's

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,799
very minimal but we are actually doing

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,960
some

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,559
production experiments around this work

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
are you able to say what part of the app

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,640
is uh

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,559
experimenting with it uh it's some

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,320
settings page that's buried it's it's

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,760
very trivial it's like a technical proof

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,120
of concept there's nothing like

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,799
we're not even doing anything that you

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,520
couldn't have done without it it's just

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,640
like

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,440
does the stack work got it um

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,520
it's it treads into a lot of tricky

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,520
waters like around post css

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
and web packer and like all these areas

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
where we've kind of intentionally

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,880
avoided on the

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,159
new component project but kind of feels

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
like an inevitability

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,120
like we're gonna have to deal with it

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
with assets like they're a big part of

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,360
building ui

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,559
um and that's kind of like a that's kind

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,240
of an area of what i would call

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,320
like more like research we're doing

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,080
right now which is like

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,799
some pretty pretty exciting stuff to be

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
doing as a as a rails engineer you know

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,559
with the framework that's been around

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,000
this long yeah i mean it's it's

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
it's fascinating too as well because

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,840
like my experience in rails was coming

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,120
at rails 3.2 uh and eventually

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,240
being on four so this is back 2012 2013

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,320
is when i first got that's when i got

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,360
started too yeah yeah would your

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,799
did you do a boot camp as well i uh i

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,279
did an apprenticeship at a

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,880
at a software consultancy and that's

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,520
based in rhode island called mojotec it

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,960
was right

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,720
as boot camps were starting to be a

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,440
thing yeah that they would do a couple

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,039
apprenticeships

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,559
where you just came in and they paired

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,360
you with a senior and you paired for

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,000
like

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,919
three months okay yeah just like taught

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,240
you rails it was the best thing ever

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,600
yeah there was one of those with my

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
hometown too as well

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,480
uh um yeah which uh

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
yeah i applied for that but i didn't get

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,799
it uh so i ended up just learning online

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,240
uh through like the rails guides and a

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,159
ton of other places

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
yeah that's uh that's fascinating but

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,120
also i was gonna say yeah

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,880
it's gonna be nice to be able to do

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,480
something that's kind of cutting edge

00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,919
like regardless of this like well it

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
sounds like the the css

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,760
stuff is going back to the drawing board

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,240
but it's got to be fun to be able to

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,200
like

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,559
solve problems and like event solutions

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,600
too as well

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,440
yeah i mean that's i don't know i'll be

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,799
honest man like this is a dream job for

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,480
me like yeah

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,080
the the mix of what i have right now

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,880
where it's like roughly a third on the

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,799
framework

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
a third on primer and then a third just

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,399
like helping people with the company use

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,039
them both properly like

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,240
i i'm pretty happy guy getting to do all

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,279
that

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,080
yeah no i've i agree i i feel like

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,760
um i i work on such smaller problems in

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,720
the open source world uh because i just

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,640
don't have any

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,000
uh long-standing relationships and

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,440
projects uh

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,559
currently um but i love this uh going

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,000
around and like

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:50,000
dropping issues in questions um

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,679
not so much of uh the long-standing like

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,039
back and forth uh with code

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,600
um but yeah very cool

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,720
and who else is uh working on this with

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,880
you um

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,880
at github uh

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,320
let's see the people who are working on

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,720
it with me currently

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,480
uh christian uh oddsson

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,840
uh kaihiga blake williams

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,360
and meanwhile okay cool yeah

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,120
pretty good pretty solid team they uh

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,640
oh my goodness it's just so much fun

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,519
like i took some time off this week to

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,039
go see family

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,559
post vaccine um and i just came back you

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,679
know this morning looked at slack and

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,200
they're cranking away

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,399
shipping code writing issues it's it's

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,840
it's really

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,720
that's been i think the most fulfilling

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,039
part of this project has been like

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
realizing that to execute on a vision

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,279
this big i need to work with other

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,080
people

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
and just seeing the fruits of that that

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,159
like

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,320
i mean at this point i write code but

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,320
like

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
other people are are well equipped to do

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,159
that so i i

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,440
focus a lot on equipping other people to

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,240
to make good contributions to the

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,760
project

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
whether they're in the community or not

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,799
like i regularly like

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,799
some people in the chat might even be on

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,159
this list that like if someone files a

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
good issue on the project and it's

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,559
something that like

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,519
we all agree we need especially if

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,240
something would be useful for us

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,559
internally

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,679
i'll be the first to go to email and say

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,320
hey let's just pair on it

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
i'll help you get started yeah i hope

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,279
you write the right tests and like we'll

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,120
talk about architecture whatnot so you

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,440
can submit a

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,559
um good pr that's i i do that about once

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,919
a month with someone

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,080
completely new to the project from

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,960
around the world that is like

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,440
that's some fun stuff man like yeah it's

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,039
really

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,039
it it reminds me of like how often

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
i struggle to explain my job to

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,880
non-technical people

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,640
they're like you work on open source

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,799
like what even is open source

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,120
wait your work is free why do they pay

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,039
you to do this

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,320
yeah yeah i mean there's so much value

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,120
too as well as getting like

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,000
like um who was it the the bridgetown

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,039
person

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,840
uh yeah jared's in there yeah yeah

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,640
he had he he jumped in with other areas

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,760
uh

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
it's it's cool to see like his response

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,600
here

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,520
because he's working on a project

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,119
unrelated to github

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,960
that is solving a whole nother problem

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,280
to then eventually

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
give you enough fuel or ammo to

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,159
basically say

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,200
okay let's not even attempt the jekyll

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,639
thing right now

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,240
because uh jared's having some issues so

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,159
like we should just help jared

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,679
help him solve it and then now you have

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,240
this whole another stream

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,520
a consciousness and at bats to be able

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,839
to solve a problem that you don't have

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
to

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
focus on and you can focus on the css

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,919
stuff or something else

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,280
um so it's nice to see that i see the

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,119
value in open source but i know

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
it's a uphill battle and i know there's

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,440
a whole conferences around this and

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,760
trying to convince enterprises to to get

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,359
involved in open source in a way that

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
it's beneficial to community beneficial

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,040
to you but also beneficial to some

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,399
somebody who just wants to help solve a

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,640
problem

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,760
yeah and i think that that's like isn't

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,720
that the goldilocks

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,119
question for all this is like how do you

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
like

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,240
i've never done open source before this

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,280
is my one open source product i've ever

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,960
done

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,800
like how did we get here like

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,119
i kind of think that it's really just a

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,240
factor that of the rails community

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,359
like there's so much convention in the

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,520
rails world

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,280
like we started this project and someone

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,760
came in like out of the blue and was

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,200
like

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,119
why don't we just do action mail or

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,560
previews but for components

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,440
and i'm like duh and like he's now

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,520
landed like

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,880
dozens of prs building this feature and

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,400
maintaining the feature like that's an

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,680
entire part of the framework

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,200
i have never written a line of code

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,880
in that whole part of the framework but

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,280
we use it internally

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,960
um and he just knew because of rails

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,079
conventions that like this feature would

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
make sense

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,440
yeah and this just happens over and over

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,720
and over again so like

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,599
i think that the alignment with the

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,480
community has been our kind of way in

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,680
like if you've contributed to anything

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,200
in rails you could come into this

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,720
framework and feel right at home because

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
we name things the same way we use the

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
same documentation tool the same test

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,079
framework like

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,640
we're doing a lot of the same stuff um

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,359
and it's i think it's shown there's a

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,359
lot of

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,000
a lot of people lining up to write code

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,000
just pretty cool

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,079
cool well with that we're almost that

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,560
time uh

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,000
we just had a xkcd comic just get

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,520
dropped in the chat so

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,240
i figured for the benefit of the people

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
here with us

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,000
we'll share this this we should make

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,280
this a thumbnail on the youtube video

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,440
but uh but amazing yeah

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,200
and this is uh this is uh open source

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
yeah and i think that like that's also

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,720
been a big lesson on asking for help on

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,040
this project is that like

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,240
i love taking vacations like they'll i

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
just took the last like two and a half

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,119
days off

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,480
i didn't bring any work stuff with me

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,320
and because we have

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,839
really strong community a really strong

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,200
community internally and externally i

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,560
feel comfortable stepping away for a

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,760
couple days or for a little while

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,520
because i know that

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,520
i'm not the only i'm not the one little

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,359
block there in the comic like

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
there's a whole series of blocks holding

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,079
up the

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,920
up the the jenga tower yeah for sure

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,280
yeah that's that's i mean that's that's

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,640
a wonderful thing to hear too as well

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
because like there is a question

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
i spoke at pycon yesterday and there's a

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,280
question that came up in the the q a

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,680
about

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
burnout uh because i spoke in the

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,800
lightning track

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
round so we all q and a together and

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,839
there was one person that

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,599
talked about mental health and how it

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,640
applies to programming

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,280
and uh yeah but burnout is real

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,480
uh even if it's your day job uh because

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,839
there's always gonna be issues there's

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,400
always gonna be something else to look

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,680
for

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,680
like that even if it's something you

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,359
love like it doesn't have to you

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,200
you can be burned out by things that are

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,680
your that are the highest

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,800
form of satisfaction for you and that's

00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
been a real lesson for me on this

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,680
project just like

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,040
starting to see signs of that at times

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,520
but

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,280
asking for help and luckily i'm just so

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,040
fortunate to work with people that like

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,040
i can put my complete trust in like i

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,599
have i have several people on the group

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,599
that i told you about that like

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,720
if i needed to step away for a month i

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,040
wouldn't even blink

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,839
i trust them completely and that you

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,680
know

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,920
that that makes open source sustainable

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,280
for me because it is a lot of work to

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,480
run this project and

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,560
you know give talks and and whatnot

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:33,599
that it's good to have a team behind you

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,599
