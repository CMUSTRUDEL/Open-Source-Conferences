	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
we have almost 600 contributors which is

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,799
uh orders of

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,720
an order of magnitude you know bigger

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,920
than our team and and stuff like that

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,040
um um yeah i

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,720
am the co-founder

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,720
co-ceo of forum we build

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
open source community software and we

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
started with

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,400
uh dev which itself started with the

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,240
twitter account called the practical dev

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,720
and i've been working on this for the

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,239
better half of uh you know a little over

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
half a decade

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,760
with the project in some capacity we

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,800
became a company

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,520
um in 2017

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,120
and last year we decided that the

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
project is called forum

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,039
even though we've been working on the

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,399
code base for years as just the thing

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,480
that powers dev

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
and yeah we want to build around this

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,640
idea

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,640
of open source community with an async

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,000
first dynamic helping people keep up

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
with content and you know

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,640
as opposed to a chat based uh system

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
and mostly we want to help folks um you

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
know foster and scale community online

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
and and to have it done in the most

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,240
open and transparent way possible we

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
didn't necessarily want that to be the

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,720
direction we really didn't want to own

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,119
the whole thing

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,159
and so we started working towards making

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,240
the form factor

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,360
open source and so anyone can host

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
something that

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,260
is going to have a similar form factor a

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,640
lot of the same features

00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,240
[Music]

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
you know be able to reuse all the

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,159
moderation features

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
uh you know you don't have to

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
re-implement the capacity to block a

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
user you're not comfortable with

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,840
you don't have to re-implement all this

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,040
work we put into it

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
and that's just the nature of open

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
source we want to be we want to be

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
sharing and we really feel like

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,360
within this form factor you know online

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,680
community social media

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
the nature of the whole thing being open

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
source

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,520
in order to provide transparency is

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
itself pretty powerful we love the idea

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
that the

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,439
the more success forum has the more

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,239
uh the more time is spent on a platform

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,959
that is open to scrutiny where you know

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
if we push

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
new functionality to the core code base

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,280
um

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,879
everyone's going to see it and you know

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,200
within the nature of like

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
this space in the broader implications

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
for society

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,000
we just really feel like it's a good

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
thing to be working on something

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,879
together

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,239
um in the open and to help solve

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
solve problems excellent and uh so

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
if i understand this correctly so code

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
newbies uh form is completely different

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
from dev

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
and so the posts that are here in

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,239
codenb's post they don't show up

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,000
in the dev post um yep they're

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
completely different folks can cross

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,239
post and we want to make it you know

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
easy for

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,599
for people to be able to maybe

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,360
distribute one post to multiple

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,519
communities if they want to like

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
it's currently technically possible via

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,159
apis and stuff

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,440
you know folks have been starting to

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
build some pretty interesting

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,680
third-party

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,920
software to help tie things together

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
and you right now have a browser

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
extension installed

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
yeah it acts in a similar way so this is

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,200
third-party

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,959
uh a third-party browser extension like

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,239
we created it but anyone could create

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
something similar there's no

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,599
there's no um authorization to create

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,799
something that work that helps tie the

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,959
communities together

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
but this is an example it's just a it's

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
a

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,760
it's a navbar that just shows up

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,760
next to a forum and you just added the

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,159
code newbie to your list of forums

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
and so uh now you just have this

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,519
whenever you get to a forum you have

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,840
navigation to other forums

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,920
um except uh no forum

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,680
knows uh what other forums you're a part

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,799
of it really just helps you

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,480
navigate the independent web you know

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
technically speaking this this is an

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
iframe so it's hidden from the rest of

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
the page so even if

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
a forum wanted to find out what's in

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
there that there's just not that

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,360
there's a layer of security there yeah

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,799
and

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,799
and um we so so yeah so

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,400
long story short people can cross post

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,280
between dev and code movie at the same

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
time

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,919
but um they are totally independent the

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,799
tools that tie them together

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
are you know that's the the stuff that

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,520
can help tie together the ecosystem but

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
there's no

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,479
central authority on what a post is

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
everything exists in a database and we

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,160
can we care about compatibility

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,080
and we care about um you know

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,840
moderation within the overall ecosystem

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
we're not going to promote a forum that

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,479
that we feel like

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,520
is is not being effectively moderated or

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
served in the broader

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,720
um community context but we also don't

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
have the power to unilaterally decide

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
what effective moderation is so there's

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,639
a matter of diplomacy that's built in

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,639
here that we

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
think is you know inherently a lot

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
healthier than than

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,560
you know top-down rule um

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
and yeah we're we're just sort of like

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,880
excited to

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
invent our way into new ideas within

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,639
this

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
like within the ecosystem okay excellent

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
so

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
i guess my my first question is if i i'm

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
curious if i wanted to set up my own

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,199
forum and we'd chat about this like

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
opensource.pizza is my my personal

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
project

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
uh what are the first steps for me

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
setting up my own form

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,840
uh if i wanted to get this um well get

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,440
it on the iframe eventually but just

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,240
basically set up my form is there like a

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,840
fork or a clone process

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,680
um so we have a

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,919
uh so right now you wouldn't fork

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
or clone it's the same code base for

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,960
everything so you're not going to take

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,440
this and change anything all changes can

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,800
happen

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,479
within the code itself um

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,919
so you're going to take this exact same

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,199
code you don't have to make any changes

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,520
to the code

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
and you're going to run it in a in a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
cloud environment or

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
on your own machine if you want uh our

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
instructions for doing so effectively

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
are not yet public so that's kind of

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
what where

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,720
um people have done that so like

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,639
forum dev was first built on heroku

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,520
and the the um process of hosting on

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
heroku

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,759
is is public i think it's in our docks

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
but it's really not our

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,199
our designated place we want to we want

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
to um

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
uh promote a little bit closer to the

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
metal um

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,840
containerized deployments of hero of a

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,120
forum

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,120
and we're going to be launching that

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
like within a couple weeks so if you're

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
listening to this and you're excited i'd

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
say like uh

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
wait around we have it mostly documented

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,520
i think

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,720
um as far as i know i think we're we're

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
waiting on one

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
dependency to just hit a new version

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
because we don't want it

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
to launch like right before a core

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,759
dependency

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,360
we know it's about to get a new major

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
version so we're sort of

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
just just wait playing the waiting game

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,840
a little bit on that

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,400
but um once once that launches

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,720
basically our full instructions you're

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,199
gonna be able to

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
take a containerized version of forum

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,919
plop it into

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,720
say digital ocean it's going to take you

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
know

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,000
maybe a gig of memory some compute it's

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,800
it's um

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,639
uh you know hopefully we can get it

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,520
inside one of the smaller

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,520
like compute

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
containers you know available and um you

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,479
basically take that

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,440
and you uh you run an ansible command

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
um you know basically you take a script

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,919
we we provide you

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,960
we you go to azure or

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
digitalocean or aws or whatever the best

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,199
environment for you is

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,360
we're not going to launch with support

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
for for every cloud right away but you

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,919
can also launch it

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
in your uh you know in your closet if

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
you really want to

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
it's it's open source software it runs

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,440
anywhere yeah um

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
but basically yeah you take the

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,599
container you put it in the cloud

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,879
and it mostly just works if you follow

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,240
the instructions

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,120
and you know with the code newbie idea

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
and with everything

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,479
we're trying to push here like i'm

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
really excited for

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,400
folks who want to play around with forum

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
to actually get familiar with some new

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
sort of

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,759
sis admin work that's like not too heavy

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
duty you don't need to go to school on

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,560
sys

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,840
system system administration in order to

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,440
host a forum

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,440
but you kind of have to like you know

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
install a couple command line tools and

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,800
and get going with that and

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
it's going to be pretty interesting

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
because we want form to be for everyone

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,080
you know not just developers so over

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,839
time we're going to be

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,519
trying to simplify the tooling provide

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,279
our own hosting

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
which we already do to some extent but

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,959
but not at a large scale

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,720
and the uh

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,279
you know we hope that we usher in a

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
new space for independent community that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
competes

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,839
on user experience and form factor with

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,600
you know these these 500 billion dollar

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,360
companies that that

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,000
whose business is really built around

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,120
around you know absolute consumption

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,880
and um you know with everyone who gets

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
to use this contribute back

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,760
improve the the functionality and really

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,200
invest in in the ecosystem

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,360
normalize the idea that if you're going

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
to invite someone on to your community

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
you're not telling them about a facebook

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
group you're telling them about your

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
forum you're going to give them a url

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
that

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,560
you registered and

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,000
the um yeah and so like starting in a

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,160
couple weeks that's going to be

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,279
a lot more accessible for anyone who you

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
know

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
if you've heard of digitalocean you

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,399
probably have the skills to take mantra

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,800
for them it's pretty simple if you're

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
that

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
like if you know what the service is

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
yeah

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
you probably uh can follow our

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,240
instructions and get it up and running

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,240
pretty quickly with

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
with no uh coding skills necessarily

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
um but then if you want to contribute

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
back the whole thing is open source and

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
the purpose of being open source is not

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
necessarily

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
just so everyone can contribute back um

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
but

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,440
it's uh to provide transparency to

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
provide

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,920
you know scrutiny and to give us

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,839
you know like the best layer of

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
communication we possibly can with with

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
anybody who's using it

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
what about the uh i'm curious uh and

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,880
maybe i don't know if you thought about

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
this but i know you all

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
are watching uh a sort of a nice digital

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
ocean

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,320
perhaps uh deployment path what about

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
updates

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
so as as dev figures out new features

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
like

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,000
y'all added form as uh our forms and

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,160
listings and

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
you also had like add videos as well as

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,440
another option

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
that i've seen in the last couple years

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
if if

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,279
dev has new features or code newbies has

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
new features like how do you

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,839
how do you have updates there's gonna be

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,800
like a plug-in infrastructure

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,480
so the core functionality is going to

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,440
keep getting updates

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
pretty consistently we're going to have

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,350
tag releases

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
expect folks to

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,160
[Music]

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,120
take the new code and update their

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
forums

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,959
pretty regularly um the

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,640
uh you know the notion of updating

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
something that's um

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
live on the internet has a lot of you

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
know we need to maintain

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,800
compatibility maintain um you know

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,959
everything we uh like

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,839
the whole kind of purpose of collecting

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,279
on a project

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,760
is to continue to benefit from ongoing

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
work

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,320
and uh we will

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,079
shrinking what the core project is and

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,440
there will be some plug-in

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,279
um marketplace ideas going forward

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
but mostly you know like core

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,920
improvements the core product are going

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,279
to be shipped

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,720
with the core products so you're going

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
to have to buy into something that's

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
going to

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,000
change over time gain new features

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
and we have to be respectful of the

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,120
community in that sense so like

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,079
if you're going to install and host a

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
forum

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,920
you're going to have to know that like

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
generally we're working

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
collectively to keep the ecosystem

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,519
healthy and

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,959
that doesn't necessarily mean like a

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,720
guarantee that this

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,399
view will never look a little different

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
you know um

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,880
there has to be this sort of collective

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,920
buy-in that we're not you're not hosting

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,360
you know uh you're not hosting a website

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,880
that's gonna like

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
always have your full control over the

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
look and feel

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
in every capacity we're gonna offer you

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,639
know ample ways to customize

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
but um you're sort of buying into like

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,959
this shared philosophy of

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,639
of uh of ongoing development and we

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,320
don't wanna be caught in this situation

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,839
where we feel scared to update it

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,360
because too many people are too bought

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,320
into like a certain

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,519
certain style so that's about us um you

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
know maintaining a pulse with the

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,560
community

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
and um and then just being an open

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,639
source project which

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
if we ever like shipped something that

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,079
enough people were unhappy with they

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
could fork and actually take the project

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,000
in in their own way which

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
is something we don't want to have

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,560
happen but

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
we're um you know we're open to the idea

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,480
that this

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,519
whole thing is about community and trust

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
and

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
ongoing relationships and something

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,240
we're gonna have to keep

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,920
keep leaning into but um i feel like

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
we've gained a decent amount of goodwill

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
over the years

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,550
just the fact that we've wanted to take

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
this approach

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,399
[Music]

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,320
in the future like the way uh forum is

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,720
um

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
uh is looked after could could evolve

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,639
over time you know like right now it's

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
just run by the forum company and there

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,560
could be shifts

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,639
in how things are done but uh we're just

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,920
excited that yeah you're gonna have to

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,199
keep getting updates and if you

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
stop updating your forum it may be okay

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
for you

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
but it might mean you have a less secure

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,760
version you're not going to get new

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
new patches or anything like that and

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,399
you know over time

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,760
we'll probably like stop linking to you

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,519
as often if you're not maintaining

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,199
compatibility with the latest features

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
and things like that

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,639
but it's it's kind of just like the open

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
web you know if you

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,680
if you stopped updating your blog ten

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
years ago uh

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,279
google is going to probably stop linking

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,040
to you because you won't have mobile

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:30,560
compatibility and things like that so um

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,000
it's it's it's we see it as sort of like

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,720
an interesting evolution on

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,199
on how the web can work together itself

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,560
yeah yeah

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,079
that makes a lot of sense too as well

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
i'm sure there's some there's ways you

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,279
could

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,160
sort of get automation and updates uh i

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
i i

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,440
i wrote a script for the github api

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,279
that it has a sort of upstream that

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
there's a github app that this

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,360
sends me updates as prs uh when some

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
breaking changes happen

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
and it it helps me because like it's

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,000
hard to you know

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,079
keep tabs and stuff especially if i have

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
a busy month or you know i take a month

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
off because i have a kid or something

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
like that

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,839
um so it's nice to get those things

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
automated and

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,600
but also sounds exciting though to be

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,760
able part of something bigger

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,320
and growing community with the support

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,079
of the forum company

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,680
oh yeah and the i mean the process of

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
hosting a forum is just running some

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
scripts so like

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
you're needing to type in the keys is

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,040
not necessarily

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
like these are computers you know

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,880
automation is is

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,360
part of the game and um i'm not sure

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,040
like what that next step is necessarily

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
we're sort of taking baby steps towards

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,880
getting the infrastructure

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,199
right uh but the um

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,120
you know the long term is that you know

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,000
whatever uh

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,240
whatever responsibilities require you to

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
be in the loop and to make the updates

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,759
and things like that we're gonna provide

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
that and we want to

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,800
we actually really kind of want to

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
create a culture where

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,040
folks care about the updates and keep up

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,000
with the software early on you know

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,920
while so many of our of our core users

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
are developers we actually kind of want

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,240
to keep that

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,320
that like um that dialogue

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
open and stuff like that we're not you

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,560
know rushing to make this

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,399
just like a pure one-click solution with

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,639
no variability like

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
we want folks to invent new ways to host

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,639
it effectively

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
um the core code base has to be

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,600
you know you need to maintain

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,240
compatibility from user experience

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,279
perspective

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,560
but we we expect innovation to come from

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,399
folks who are uh

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,880
hosting this and um just like how we

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
took

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
you know years to sort of shift from

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
just doing dev

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,880
to like really starting to get formed to

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,560
be a real thing

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
as long as we can continue to help

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,959
anybody who's adopting it

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,320
succeed dramatically

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,360
we're we're not gonna like take

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,160
the shortcuts to to like

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,000
to to where we're going because it's

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,880
gonna be a discovery process

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,920
okay cool uh i have a quick question i

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
don't know if you have the answer to it

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,760
but the uh

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,120
i noticed the license agpl

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,079
um which i think it's the apache license

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,520
uh any reasons uh actually no i'm

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,880
completely off

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,640
the effect i've actually never seen this

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,839
license before yeah so

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,039
this is the uh the gpl which is a copy

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,480
left license and the

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,600
pharaoh moderation is is um it's sort of

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,919
like an update for server based software

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,960
that you might host like on in the cloud

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,960
or or

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,440
whatever so the the the base of the gpl

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,240
is that it is copy left which means that

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
you

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,640
it's actually a pretty it's a slightly

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
more it's a more restrictive license

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
than

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,080
than say mit yeah and uh

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,039
you're not allowed to take this code

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,280
and to modify it and make that

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,360
modification closed source

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,880
so um which is you know like

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
people are going to debate on like the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
the values of different licenses

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
and stuff but we really feel like if

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
we're putting this

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,640
out there we want to promote the ongoing

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,880
lingerie longevity of the open source

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,080
uh and being social media software we

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,440
really want to

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,760
encourage transparency at every layer

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,679
and it's not like it's literally

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,720
impossible to

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,080
you know run certain parts of that

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,039
like certain things might happen that

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
like are not running um transparently

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,559
because there's like

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,480
you know there's a console you can open

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,000
up and interact with with the database

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
and things like that it's not

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,559
impossible but we really feel like if

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,480
the core code base can maintain

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,600
like just a real strong open source

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,600
thing going on that uh it's just good

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
for social media period where like we

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,520
can say

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,320
like hey if if you're if the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
community you're a part of is operating

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,440
on

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,559
the forum as licensed you're going to be

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
able to look under the hood and see

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,160
what's going on like you're going to

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,280
know

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,240
what is a what is affecting you you know

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
there's going to be like

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
a bit of lack of context because like

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,799
you won't see the entire data context

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
like

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,360
you know but um you're going to get as

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,280
much transparency as possible

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,559
and over time we just want to keep

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,200
leaning into this like

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,480
privacy transparency and the license

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
choice was really deliberate in that

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,000
sense

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
gotcha um that makes a lot of sense too

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
as well in the context of social media

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,400
and

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,600
the current environment of i guess

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
social media and

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
data and advertisements and stuff like

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,640
that so

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,400
um thanks for going down that rabbit

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
hole with us uh because i

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
was not aware of that that license but

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,440
uh it's got me

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,039
questioning some of the projects i'm

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,160
working on if i should leverage a

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,559
different license besides

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,039
mit um yeah i mean there's lots of like

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,799
the everything gets more complicated the

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
more you try to get into like anything

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
gpl and stuff and

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
we know there's like a ton of debate

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,799
around this

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,000
sort of uh what all of this stuff but

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,880
um we uh we felt like this was a decent

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,080
choice for us

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:21,760
and we also um we asked that folks uh

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,240
um sign a uh contributor agreement when

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,559
they're

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
when they're um when they're

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,120
contributing

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,480
uh such which allows us to potentially

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,159
if we ever needed to go in a different

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,039
direction with the license

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,000
um we are allowed we could before can go

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
in a different direction

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
and folks kind of need to know that like

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,960
that it's like

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
um it's possible for the license to

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,679
change over time but we're

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,520
we're pretty um uh

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:53,520
pretty encouraged by the idea that uh

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,880
just being a good copy left uh

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
open source thing um contributes a lot

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,000
to

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,559
like the nature of of open source in the

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,720
space

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,720
and you know there's we've so normalized

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,960
the idea of open source

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
operating systems because of licenses

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,640
like this and

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,159
the i'm no purist in terms of some of my

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
you know free and open source opinions

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
like uh

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,919
i just want to do what's best for for

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
the overall uh

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,280
social good of of the code we're running

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,280
but um

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,799
as a component of that i think the being

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,159
thoughtful about the licenses

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,440
uh goes a long way okay cool

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,080
and then since we're down this rabbit

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,919
hole um i wanted to ask too about

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,520
how the structure of the team is work

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,480
working right now um

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,880
are you getting a lot of outside

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,520
contributions or i know you're weeks

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,240
away from

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,520
shipping a sort of public one-click

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
deployable i don't know if it's one

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,679
quick i don't want to speak for your

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,840
your product but

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,360
uh an easy deployed solution so are you

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,000
getting a lot of contributions outside

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,679
of

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,200
the forum team or the company itself

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,000
so yeah i mean we've uh

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,559
we've had just about 600 different

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,720
contributors into the code base so

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,320
way more than the you know the team

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,280
itself um

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,159
but lately as we march towards uh some

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,440
of these

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,400
um uh milestones

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
um it has been like a real focus on like

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,559
our team just getting to

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,039
a certain point and we get a ton of uh

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,280
we get a ton of great contributions from

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,080
just folks who are stopping by

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,919
and uh you know we're really supportive

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,000
really trying to

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,000
um let folks uh

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,159
contribute like to things they um

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,880
uh can contribute to effectively we

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
currently have

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
76 issues marked ready for dev which

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,960
means that folks can

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,120
we feel like hey there's enough context

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,440
here that people can contribute

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:03,679
um but uh you know being like a

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,039
um trying to you know maintain velocity

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,640
be a a small enough team like we're

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,240
we're pretty pragmatic about this we

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,240
feel like um

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
the approach we take in the long run is

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,520
gonna always sort of ebb and flow

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,919
between like

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,760
opportunities when we can like really

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,400
really work collaboratively with a bunch

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,640
of folks

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
and times where like we just have to

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,320
hunker down and

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,080
and and get something out the door and

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,080
um it's always sort of a give and take

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,440
and we need to sort of learn to be

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,799
um be really good at this stuff

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,640
um and we try not to be like too

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,559
um um

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
all or nothing in terms of like what

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,559
open source is for

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,240
and stuff and um but we really feel like

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,279
our best work is in the open

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,600
and over time we really want to

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,200
keep leaning on this we have a a forum

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
called forum.dev

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,120
which is where we have more open-ended

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,559
discussions where

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,400
like we'll kind of talk about um

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,080
the nature of the forum project and we

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,000
we anticipate that being

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,080
a little bit more active once we

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,039
actually launch with the like really

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
full like easily hostable version for

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,200
for outsiders

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,679
um but we uh we chose this

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,600
because it sort of co-located questions

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,760
and and uh

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,640
uh questions for the product and nature

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,559
of what we're doing

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,159
with our you know announcements of our

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
change log and our contributions and

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,640
stuff like that so like

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,760
uh locating discussions right alongside

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,159
blog posts like was a form factor we

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,679
we want to keep leaning in on with dev

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,360
and with everything else we're doing

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,480
and um we're uh we enjoy using form for

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,640
for these purposes and uh so we have

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,640
almost 600 contributors which is uh

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
orders of an order of magnitude you know

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,400
bigger than our team and

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,440
and stuff like that um so it's been a

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,480
community

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,400
effort but you know i think like

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,320
as we evolve there's there's going to be

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
that much more opportunity

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,240
once things really stabilize for people

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
to keep keep contributing we want to

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,559
make um

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
we want to make hosting forums as cheap

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
as possible

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,919
so that that's going to mean you know

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,279
like efficient queries making

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,600
you know reducing memory like just a lot

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,080
of work into the core

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,000
code base and uh you don't always need

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,520
like context into our entire product

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,799
roadmap in order to like

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,600
contribute to this um the efficiency of

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,720
the product

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,240
the the performance and uh and the code

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,679
quality and stuff so

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,600
we have a lot of these features that are

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,720
marked ready for dev but

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,159
anything that's you know a refactor

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,360
an improvement like is uh

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:52,080
is is a huge part of like the

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,520
ongoing life of the project yeah and i

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,919
noticed in the uh

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,159
the the last commits too as well and you

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,559
you made uh alluded to this as well

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,720
uh remove elasticsearch so is that part

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,600
of the trying to keep it

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,159
efficient and cheap for folks to go and

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,120
ship this

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,320
in a couple weeks for themselves yeah so

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,600
elastic

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,480
is um a big

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,679
big dependency and removing it actually

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
you know made our search

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,840
the cert on platform search a little

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,400
worse

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,679
which you know it was a trade-off and

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,799
and we want to go back and

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,480
improve that from there but um

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,320
the uh people can you know there's lots

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,400
of opportunities to use google

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,440
and and search engines to access the

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,279
forum there's

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,279
an it's going to be an ongoing discovery

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
of just like what fits inside a forum

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,919
versus what external tools can use to

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,240
kind of

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,360
um work with form but we want to shrink

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
that nucleus

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,080
and elastic was a dependency we had of

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,400
course it is open source

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,760
it's not like uh it was you know

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,240
stopping us from

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,440
uh running good open source software but

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
it was just a really expensive

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,480
dependency and

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,279
um takes over a gig just to stand up

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,039
an instance of elasticsearch it adds

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,240
complexity in the in the

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,320
in the infrastructure and um

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,679
removing it in favor of postgres search

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,000
uh has just been really

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,240
cool to see like we want to keep leaning

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,440
in on postgres as like

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,320
the core technology really like anything

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,240
can uh evolve about the code base the

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,720
dependencies and stuff and and we really

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,440
want to try and reduce dependencies and

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,960
see what we can get out of postgres and

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,679
you know there might be a future where

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
the entire code base is is rewritten

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,000
into

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,760
you know a tiny binary that runs a forum

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
it still needs postgres to like store

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,159
the database

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,880
um right now that's not anywhere near

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,960
where we are

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,039
we're a rails app it makes for for uh

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,640
it makes it so that people know how to

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,760
contribute you know there's a lot of

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
conventions here

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,000
i think we're at a good we're at a good

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,159
happy medium between like

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,279
trying to reduce um reduce dependencies

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,559
like shrink down the form factor

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,520
and um but also like keep the

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,320
uh application like easy and accessible

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,600
and like

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,240
you know uh you know allow us to keep

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,039
developing features at a good pace so

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
um it's yeah that's sort of where we are

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,760
the

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,039
removal of elasticsearch for the folks

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,080
who worked on our team it was

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,880
you know really great work to uh to get

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,080
that done

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,679
and um the uh the core experience is the

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,039
exact same as it used to be you know

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,520
some of the features are

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,039
got you know regressed a little bit but

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
um

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,559
we didn't have like the perfect on-site

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,480
search before anyway like

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,880
no apps really seem to um yeah but uh

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,640
the it's it's always going to be a bit

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,960
of a give and take and stuff and we

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,960
elastic actually had replaced algolia

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,720
which was a prior

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
thing we use for search which is totally

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,000
closed source so

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,159
when we decided this path we want first

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,760
we experimented with moving from algolia

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,120
to elastic and now okay but

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,440
all the dependencies are at least open

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,159
source and then we're we

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
sort of looked at how much it's going to

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,080
cost to run a forum and and

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,320
we really want to shrink that down and

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,679
make it accessible as possible so

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,000
we decided that um removing elastic is a

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,600
step along the journey and any new forum

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
is going to take a long time before they

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,799
would need something like super advanced

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,080
search anyway yeah

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,039
so it's um it's all just part of the

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,840
journey and

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,720
we feel like uh this is uh this is all

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,399
gonna be

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,880
like really cool once we uh uh

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,720
once we expand the number of forums in

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,760
the universe and uh

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,399
and just uh start accelerating what it

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,480
can be

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,159
cool cool and i also wanna make note

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
that the chat has a question

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,520
but also ethan j hill just wanted to

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,480
mention that dev

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,480
is an awesome platform um and i love

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
that you all are giving access to

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,600
something like well the infrastructure

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,279
of what dev is uh

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,880
and being able to get other people and

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,200
have their communities running in a

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,640
similar platform or somewhere structure

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,000
put up a form

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,679
eventually for this little project i've

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,679
been working on and most folks in the

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,159
chat already know about this project so

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,120
i'll spare the introduction but it's

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,880
called open source

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
and it just helps you find your next

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,559
open source contribution

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
uh these are all the repos and i'm sort

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,240
of tracking and i can have like a little

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,320
dashboard so gatsby

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
um i can basically track my

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,799
contributions here

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
uh we've got something we're working on

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,039
where we're going to recommend

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,840
contributions

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,320
uh what i love about dev is at the

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,200
moment if i go into my dashboard

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,480
i've got a bunch of open source posts

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,760
that sort of showcase like

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
we were talking about good first issues

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,320
and different releases and i i never got

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,520
my stride

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,520
of trying to talk about stuff on dev um

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
but i've always wanted to have a place

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,080
where other folks can also

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,559
share tips and tricks at open source um

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,799
so like i i am so ready to um

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,360
set up an open source form um so that

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,760
way we can centralize

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,799
information um centralized information

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,679
that's the opposite of what you've been

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,960
talking about but basically

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,399
decentralized information in a

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,039
centralized place

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,039
oh yeah yeah yeah i mean the

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,600
centralization of this stuff

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,559
is important like dev exists because the

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,320
centralization

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,840
of knowledge helps a lot of people

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,840
and um people

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,200
come up with good ideas because of other

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,360
ideas and community

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,279
is so important with this whole thing

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,880
and a certain centralization is is

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,000
really important

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,120
and um our you know philosophy

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,640
is just like it only kind of goes so far

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,760
before it becomes like

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:54,080
not the be-all end-all and the fact

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,640
that like if you want to um

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,440
if you want to really like see your

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,840
curative vision forward

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
with open source like you could

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,039
certainly like

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
use dev in certain ways but then you're

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,440
just really like playing to our

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,519
algorithm

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,720
you know like i mean i'm on tick tock i

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,360
see people just like

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,200
literally like p everyone knows the

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,519
algorithm the algorithm is just part of

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,640
the

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,799
the life and and it's um you

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,559
as someone who wants to like build

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,679
community like you don't necessarily

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,679
need to do that like

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,039
entirely on our terms it can be more of

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,799
a collaborative relationship through

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,399
open source software

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,320
and um the there's a place for the open

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,600
source organization to exist on dev

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,600
because there's this like

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,000
beacon of information there's a lot of

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,039
breadth like it's a town square

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,200
you know it's not like the the

00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,880
representative

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,279
of of uh of one

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,039
you know space only ever needs to talk

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,200
to itself there's a reason to like

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,120
put stuff out into the universe but

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,960
there's a lot of context where

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,039
where you're gonna have more success if

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,760
if everyone who's part of open source

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,960
is is is bought in they know the context

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,799
they know this post is

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,480
gonna go to this space and um and

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,399
uh but you still get to leverage you

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,039
know the asynchronous communication

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,039
style

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,320
all the moderation functionality um

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,720
even all of the like really extensible

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,200
um code codeable parts of dev so

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,519
if you go to dev dot to slash codeland

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,960
um

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,440
it's an example um this is like

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
last year's codeland conference um so

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
it's a little less

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
active than like the day of uh but

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,360
nothing on this page

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,640
is built into forum or dev

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,120
per se um but uh

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
it's like a codable page that exists

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,799
within the within the ecosystem so

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,320
there's a lot you kind of get for free

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,480
within the um

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
the product but it's also it's also

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,760
codeable for spaces like this so like

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,720
this is um

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,519
i think our our most interesting like

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,640
example of how

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,000
we've used just the the codeable nature

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,360
of forum for uh

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
for some stuff that works and if you go

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,320
to dev.t.o she coded that's another one

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,240
where like things we do um within the

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
community we used to have to like hard

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,599
code

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,359
into uh into dev and it would be like a

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,280
whole like lead up we'd have to make you

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,480
know conversations and stuff and

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,240
and um but uh

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:35,040
we uh we've been able to extract that

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,800
make things um more uh

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,079
like make new and interesting things we

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,960
do like

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,919
a simpler process of of actually just

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,040
creating a page

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,679
um that's codable and uh so

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
it's it's it's been a good um

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,079
combination of like

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,240
the abstract ability to

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,200
create landing pages from scratch but

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,880
also like

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,880
grounded in um what you get

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,040
from the community so like this page

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,079
obviously um

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,440
has data that needs to be accessed from

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,040
the community

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
um or else you wouldn't be seeing all

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,839
this this stuff here

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,720
but uh it's it's loaded via an api from

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,000
within

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,800
the from with within the site and

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,560
it's it's basically like tools for for

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,480
tools for building more community on top

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,079
of community so like she coded as the

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
special

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,280
thing that exists within the space and

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,839
and um

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,280
codeland you know an online conference

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,040
which you know wasn't going to be an

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,320
online conference last year

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:42,880
like at the start of the year yeah um

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,760
and the uh the like

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
the love for having that that whole

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,920
thing

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,440
having been just part of this ecosystem

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,240
people are already part of but it's

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,040
really custom

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,560
and special for the event um i'm

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,000
definitely a believer in like the

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,880
creativity you can

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,119
you can uh you can express when you're

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,079
like when you have a lot of good tooling

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,240
and then like

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,119
just a little bit of of open-ended

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
creativity

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,400
um in code and uh we've been able to do

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,040
that effectively

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,599
and uh the coolest thing is that anyone

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,640
else can

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,800
do things on these terms and like these

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,240
are this is all through the pages

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,520
um the pages api of uh

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,119
of a forum and i kind of

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,720
we don't even have this functionality

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,720
yet and i i actually think the actual

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
api for creating a page isn't is a

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,960
public

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,880
um or like you can only do it via like

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,800
the dashboard right now but i think as

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,119
these things expand and i think people

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,960
are gonna be able to create

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,200
um uh you know projects within github

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,880
that can then like sync up with with a

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,960
forum so it's like you don't just get

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,280
the you know the

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,880
the functionality you also get like your

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,560
functionality and you can do it on

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,440
github and you can have it all work

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,760
together

00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,800
and it all lives on your domain so it

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,720
really is your

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,560
space and um i

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,160
i just feel like the more we give this

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,680
functionality away

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,760
the more it's going to be paid back with

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,160
creativity we have a couple minutes so

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,240
any

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,920
parting words for folks who want to get

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,599
involved or want to check out some of

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,880
the stuff you all are shipping

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,640
yeah i'd just say uh like besides you

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,560
know what's available and what you can

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
follow you know maybe sign up for dev

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,480
and then forum.dev

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,440
as well to kind of get a view into what

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,960
we're doing

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,920
um i just say like uh

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
be like

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,520
be there be willing to be creative with

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,760
us

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,760
think really long term like solve

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,720
problems pragmatically

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,359
uh you know we're gonna want to solve

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,960
for

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,040
you know a little bit of like the

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,720
usability burden of having to maintain

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,240
different accounts on different profiles

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,480
like we love the idea that there's this

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,520
privacy layer that we don't control

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,640
it as a central authority but um

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,640
the uh

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,480
we also are probably going to want to

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,040
have like a version of sign up with

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
forum

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,800
itself like eventually and uh but that's

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,119
not bill yet so

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,800
i i kind of feel like we're not even

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,240
ready to wanting to have

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,160
too many sprawling conversations with

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,280
the whole community but just you know if

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,960
you're listening to this there's

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,040
opportunities to be thoughtful and to

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,760
propose ideas and like we're always

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,760
gonna

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
gonna listen to this and if if you post

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,320
on forum.dev it's gonna hit the home

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,599

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,440
like other people can riff off of it uh

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,880
there's there's a lot of opportunity to

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,280
be creative and to

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
like just think about what we can all do

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,440
together

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,680
