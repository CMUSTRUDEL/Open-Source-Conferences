okay uh yeah so i'm gonna talk about

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,839
staying afloat running a big

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
open source project so eight years ago i

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,480
wrote a script to turn on the lights

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
when the sun sets

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,480
i decided to put it on git up and i

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,960
named it home assistant

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,720
fast forward to 2019 at the state of the

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
octopus which is where github presents

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,039
like the most active projects in the

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,119
world

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,880
we were the 10th most active project in

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,080
the world

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,160
in 2020 the year after we were actually

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
the second most active python project in

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
the world

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,680
we wear this with over 8 000 people have

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
interacted with home assistant

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
now some people when they hear a stat is

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,840
like whoa this is amazing this is like

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,640
8 000 people this is larger than most

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,719
companies

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,000
but what i see is like well that's also

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,360
8 000 opinions

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,360
of people you have to deal with and

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,840
things you have to do with and actually

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
if we go back to the 2019 slide

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
and we look at the projects in these uh

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
top 10

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
most of these projects are actually

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,399
backed by billion dollar companies

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
and this is great of course they're

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,280
spending their money on open source this

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,760
is great

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
but we are there also and the way we do

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
it with the home assistant is that we

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
actually also have a company but it's my

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,119
company

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,720
the way it works is very simple we have

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,320
home assistant which is

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
freely available for all the users to

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
use then

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,560
users can choose optional to fund

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
spend subscribe to nabokasa and nabokasa

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,880
then

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
hires developers including myself to

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
work full-time on making home system

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
better

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,280
there's no investors no loans so this is

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,960
a very direct relationship and together

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
with the users and developers

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
we've been able to keep running home

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
assistant but today i want to talk about

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,960
like

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
how do we keep such an active project

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
running with a relatively small budget

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
especially compared to these big billion

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,799
dollar companies

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
well when i talk about these things i

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
like to like very simplify

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,000
first step is that we have a maintainer

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
and there's

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
a amount of work a maintainer can do

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
however what happens in open source is

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
that

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
it's actually more than just writing

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,200
source code there's

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,840
issues releases bug fixes hot fixes

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,479
communication documentation keeping

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,479
everything up to date and

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,120
what ends up happening is that there's

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,239
more work than a maintainer can handle

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,000
which results in no maintainer and the

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,400
problem with having no maintainer is

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,440
a this person is probably scarred for

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
life

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,879
this person will probably tell the

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,080
friends don't do open source because

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
this sucks

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,560
um and third there's one open source

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
project that's not being maintained

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
that's not a building block we can use

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,959
in our own projects

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,239
so today i want to talk about what we do

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,000
in the home assistant

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
to kind of like you know reduce the

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,280
workload and this kind of

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,200
boils down to three categories

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,519
the first thing is just certain things

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,080
just don't do them at all

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,519
the second thing offload work to people

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,120
that are going to contribute to the

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
project or to automations

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,239
so that way it does not come on the

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
maintainers plate

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,519
and the third is to recruit more

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,319
maintainers so you have to you can share

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,800
the workload

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,400
so before i talk about all the things

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,040
that we do in home assistant

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,319
a disclaimer these things work for us at

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
home assistant

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,840
and they might or might not work for you

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
that you know of course every project is

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
different

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
i have tried to highlight the things

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
that i also think

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,959
apply to smaller projects all right the

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
first thing that's important is just

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,319
define a scope of what you do and don't

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
want your project to do

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,080
if you define a scope and you get a

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,360
contribution that's not within the scope

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
you can just say this is not something

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
we're going to implement and then you

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
just close the pull request or close the

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,280
issue

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
you can ignore all the follow-ups

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
because sometimes people want to discuss

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
with you why they

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,599
don't want to change the scope but

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,159
that's not you know be always very firm

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,840
saying

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,760
listen this pull request this issue is

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
not the place to discuss our scope

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,120
and just have another location where

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,439
people can discuss scope that way it's

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
no longer tied to a single contribution

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,680
and it makes discussing a lot easier but

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,239
the second thing is

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,959
you don't owe anyone a single second of

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
your time

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,239
see if people are discussing things that

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,599
you don't want to implement and you've

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
already stated that

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
you don't have to keep jumping into

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
discussions

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
just let it go a lot of times you see

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
that

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,560
if you keep discussing it people will

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,400
keep being fired about

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,400
fired up about it and talking about it

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,919
but if you just like ignore it

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
it tends to die down and if people get

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
disrespectful

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
just block them because you don't owe

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
anyone

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
a single second of your time and so

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
there's a great

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
open source uh there's a great code of

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
conduct you can add to your open source

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,639
project to contribute confidence

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,720
just add it and enforce it it will make

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,639
your community a lot healthier

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
and the same for social media like

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,919
twitter you know don't

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,840
interact with people you don't want to

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,759
interact there's so many people

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
that will like not take the time the due

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
diligence to learn about your project

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
starts having

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
all these opinions start like talking

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
 just block them there's no reason

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,199
you should even see those things when

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
you open your app

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
the other thing is you should adopt the

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
code formatter in linter

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,160
and have those things automatically be

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,759
enforced when people create commits and

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
with github actions

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,360
the beautiful thing about a code

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
formatter is that you eliminate

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
a whole group of discussions should

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
there be a comma here should this be on

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,560
a new line should we sort

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,800
imports all that stuff is just taken

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,280
care for and automatically implied

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
applied that way also it doesn't

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
generate extra work

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
and it just works and the same thing

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
with linters linters are great

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,880
because once you have a code formatter

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
all the annoying lint rules are

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
generally style related

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
they're all gone and then it's only

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
about like finding bugs or

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,560
bad code practices however if you do

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
find a code practice that you

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,960
are like ah i kind of don't like this

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,720
one to be a force

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
just disable it don't feel forced to

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,360
like follow a default rule

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
and if you feel like well i want to add

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
a linter but my project is not like up

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
to the standards that i would like the

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
project to be

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
every lender has a configuration file

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,319
you can actually exclude your existing

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
files

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
so make sure your limiting only applies

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,240
to new files

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
that way you can gradually adopt it and

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
eventually get to the place where

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,199
everything

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
goes to the lender

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
the other thing that's important is to

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,039
automate all the things

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
see there's with github actions it's so

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
easy to automate and there's so many

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
great things so here's a few of my

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
favorites

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,759
the first thing is dependable dependable

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
is a bot that will automatically look at

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
your

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
dependencies and will automatically open

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
pull requests to upgrade these

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,560
dependencies

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,160
you can say limited to security updates

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
or limited to like

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
or just do everything and this is great

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
because this is again work you don't

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
have to do

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,599
automation will take care of it the

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
second thing

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,440
is release drafter release drafter is

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
this little bot that

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,800
it will every time a pull request is

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,599
merged it will make sure there's always

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,319
a draft

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,919
release ready in github with all the

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,680
titles of all the pull requests are

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,440
already linked up as well

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,960
so if you're ready to do a release just

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
edit this release

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
you add some notes about it that you

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,840
want to highlight you hit publish

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,199
and it's done and then once you hit

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
publish you got to make sure that

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,039
tagging your release

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,720
is all the release chores so for example

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,880
if you're working on a library for

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,080
python or javascript just make sure it

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,560
automatically gets pushed to pipi or npm

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,840
make sure it builds docker containers

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
everything is pretty much possible

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
now of course the main the thing that a

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,919
lot of people use but i

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,520
do want to highlight it make sure you

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,960
automatically run your test suite on

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,479
each pull request

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
because every time a pull request comes

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,720
in and automatically a lot of checks are

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
being run

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
this gives early feedback to the

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,680
contributors this is feedback that

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
maintainers don't have to give anymore

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
and actually a contributor can work with

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
its own contribution on making it better

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,360
before maintainer even gets a look at it

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,680
this means as a maintainer

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,240
you review higher quality contributions

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
the last two bots are one is closed

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,520
still issues

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,280
this is a great bot that will go through

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,599
all all pull requests and issues

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,160
this is configurable it will look at

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,120
them see when the last activity was

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,879
and then it will say okay we'll make a

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,319
comment on this issue saying hey if you

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
still have this issue

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
please post a comment otherwise we're

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,720
going to close in three days

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
a lot of issues will actually run still

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,919
nobody will comment on it

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
and it gets closed this way you kind of

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,839
keep your plate clean

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
because if your issue tap gets too big

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,800
you might stop looking at issues because

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,159
it's too overwhelming

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,080
so just clean it up if you're never

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,240
gonna look at it anyway

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
every issue still happens people will

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,160
probably open it up again

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,920
the last bot i want to highlight is the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,720
one that locks all pull requests and

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
issues

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,920
this is a great little bot because

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
often when you get a comment on all pull

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,120
requests or issue

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,760
it's useless it would be better suited

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,760
if this person had created a new issue

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,360
because with the new issue you require

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
people to submit their logs their

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
version numbers

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,680
and you actually get the right

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,120
information so to just even avoid this

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,440
from happening to begin with

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,760
just lock it be done with it not a

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
problem

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,279
the beauty about github actions is all

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,800
based on yaml and

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
you can just go to your favorite open

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,760
source repositories see the automations

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,279
they have

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
and actually copy it to your own

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,519
projects so just in case you're watching

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
this back later i've included some links

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
but

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
the things we use in home assistant for

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
python javascript typescript

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
and for documentation and they include

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,440
all these things i just mentioned

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
it's really great to just copy and then

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
there's a ton more out there

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
just like because people make them

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,080
themselves you can also make them

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,080
yourself

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,320
the other thing is create an issue

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,240
template

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,399
or if you're you can ask github for

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,160
early access to the issue forms

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,160
if you create an issue template you're

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,200
actually going to put more effort on the

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
contributor to create an

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
issue but it also means that the issues

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,800
that are created are higher quality

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
you tell people make sure you upgrade to

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
the latest version please include the

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
version you're running

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,079
please include a log file i mean a lot

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
of times people think that just saying

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,120
this doesn't work it's good enough of an

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
issue

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,560
and when you have an issue template also

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,040
make sure that you just

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,320
don't come when when you see a issue

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,279
come in and people didn't fill in the

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,040
template

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,680
just have like a default response that

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,760
says please fill in the template

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,279
otherwise you won't look at it and then

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,360
your stillbot will automatically clean

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,360
it up if people don't do it

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
the other thing is invite all the

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,240
contributors to become maintainers

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,680
any regular contributor empower them to

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
join your project

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,000
because people that join your project

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,240
they will share the workload

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
that way they will also help review prs

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
and together you can create standards on

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
what

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,440
uh what works for your project the thing

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,440
is don't be afraid that people are gonna

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
merge things that are bad because

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
this is github it's git it's version

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
control

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
you know we can always revert bad stuff

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
we can pull releases

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
we can fix stuff you know even in paid

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
products

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
bugs get shipped to production this will

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,680
also happen in open source

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,959
and it's fine just fix it when it occurs

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
and move on

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,160
especially with all the animations it

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,760
will be easy to create a new release

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,160
so don't worry about it the second thing

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,480
when it comes to contributors

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,279
um is that i suggest you start a discord

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
server

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,120
that way you can easily communicate from

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,360
the home system experience we started

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
with an email with github issues only

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,560
then with the email list then with the

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,680
forum and then we chat

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,519
and with every step the bar for

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
sending a message goes lower and lower

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,320
and lower and with every step

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
the relationships among the users and

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
the maintainers because better

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
because all of a sudden it's way easier

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
to develop friendships it is

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,200
if you don't have to blast an email list

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,760
to everybody

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
um bless an email to everybody on the

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,920
email list

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,200
but instead you can just chat etc it's

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,839
easy to get like a room together etc

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,160
and this is good and you know you want

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,839
maybe open discord server for users too

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
but definitely keep some contributor

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,200
only channels because

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,519
not everything has to be open

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
see the reason not everything has to be

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
open is

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,399
we're open source our code is open our

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
development

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,760
contributions as they get reviewed

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,480
except it's already open

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,000
and but it doesn't mean that everything

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,800
all the communication channels have to

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,399
be open

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,399
because why would you allow a random

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
person that has never contributed to

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,279
your project

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
to give your opinion on something that

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,760
like on a big direction or

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,240
something that it's just not necessary

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,040
you need to find a balance of course

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
but yeah definitely keep something uh

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
keep something closed

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
at the end you know the most important

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,160
thing is just you know take care of

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,720
yourself

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,720
and focus on the fun thank you

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,079
excellent thank you paula so much for

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
wow

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,240
that presentation um i had an

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
opportunity to talk to paulus uh

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
not before because i wasn't around here

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,040
to enter you but uh we got to talk on

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,279
the readme podcast and learn about how

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,959
home assisting got started uh folks if

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,880
you aren't aware the readme podcast is

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,760
new a new project uh put out by by

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,519
github

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,040
uh where we interview maintainers about

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
their origin stories as well as what

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,880
they're working on

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,839
today so um thanks for that paulus

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,800
and thanks for the conversation i'm

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,519
curious though your

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
your your focus around automation too as

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,160
well

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
um are there any cool automation tricks

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,600
that you use in your projects um

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,160
that maybe tie in with home assistant uh

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,720
no not right not anymore i used to be

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,880
like

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
is the build failing have to reflect on

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,800
like a light and stuff

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
at home yeah but that's just right now

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
it's like no when i'm at home

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,959
i should try to disconnect from work

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,519
right so i should try not to have open

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,519
source

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,680
pdf i even don't have notifications on

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
for discord for example because it's

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
important that when i have like it

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
should be opt-in when i get pulled into

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,360
work and not like

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
people to decide when to attack me yeah

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
yeah i mean that's a that is a great

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,680
approach to as well and also realizing

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
that we

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880

there was a panera that happened last

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
year you'll have to just research that

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
and see what that happened but if

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
