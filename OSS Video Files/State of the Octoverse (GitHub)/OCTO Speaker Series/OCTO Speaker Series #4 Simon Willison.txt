Description: 
	Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data

Every nerd deserves their own personal data warehouse - a system that gives them the same kind of analytical capability that is usually reserved for giant tech companies. I've figured out how to build one, using SQLite, Datasette and a handful of open source scripts and APIs.

I'll demonstrate my own personal Dogsheep, built using data from GitHub, Twitter, Foursquare, Apple Photos, Google, LinkedIn, 23AndMe and more. I'll show how legislation such as Europe's GDPR have made it easier for us to build our own personal analytics platforms, and discuss the way forward towards a world where we can empower even non-nerds to finally take control of their personal data.
