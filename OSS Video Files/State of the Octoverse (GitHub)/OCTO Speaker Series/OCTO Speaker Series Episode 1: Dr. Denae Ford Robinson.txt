Title: OCTO Speaker Series Episode 1: Dr. Denae Ford Robinson
Publication date: 2020-10-15
Playlist: OCTO Speaker Series
Description: 
	Golden Rules of Building Online Communities that Matter: Online communities for programmers, like Stack Overflow and GitHub, have norms that are not obvious nor inclusive to the 50 million programmers visiting monthly.

In this talk, Dr. Denae Ford Robinson, Senior Researcher - Microsoft Research will 1) offer a perspective of understanding what can inhibit participation, 2) describe what mechanisms developers are using to alleviate their own frustrations with communities, and 3) outline what on-platform mechanisms can intervene to better support engagement based on rigorous research.

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,320
hi everybody

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,760
welcome to the very first in the octo

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,520
speaker series

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,600
so glad you can be here today with us or

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
if you're watching it after the fact

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,920
thank you for watching i'm jason warner

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
i'm the cto at github

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
and earlier this year we launched the

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
office of the cto

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,680
with the express charter to explore the

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,160
unknown aspects of technology

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,399
and specifically the future of software

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
and software development

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,160
so we've decided to make that the theme

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,920
of this speaker series

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
so we'll explore how software will be

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
built or should be

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
or could be built but not with the time

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,719
frame of tomorrow

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,039
but a year from now or even five years

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,280
out

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,239
and the speakers on these topics and in

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
this series

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,920
will be a mix of academia industry and

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
open source technologists

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
we think it's very important that we get

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,559
a mix of all of those

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
so i'm looking forward to having you

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
join us for more of these talks in the

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
future

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,960
and we set up a bunch of github

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
discussions for you all to correspond

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,080
with each other on these topics

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
can't wait to hear from you so go find

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,119
all the links

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,040
on octo.github.com octo.github.com

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,479
and with that i'm going to pass it along

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,080
to my colleague uber

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,080
to kick us off thank you

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,079
thanks jason hi everyone uh thanks for

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
joining

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,479
my name is uber de moore i'm the former

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
ceo of summer

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,079
and i'm now running skunk works for

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,439
jason in october

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,720
at github we value our community above

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,320
everything else it's you the people who

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,439
collaborate on github to

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,240
advance human progress that make github

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,759
a force for good

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
when we thought about creating this

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
series of webinars

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,399
it ever seemed natural that the first

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,759
talk

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,479
should focus on that community

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,280
and also explore how we can make the

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,080
community

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,080
even better

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
it gives me immense pleasure to

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
introduce dr dene ford robinson

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
who is one of the world's foremost

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,480
authorities on this subject

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
deny is presently a senior researcher at

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
microsoft

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,239
she owns a doctorate in computer science

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,120
at north carolina state university

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,760
research identifies cognitive and social

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,959
barriers to participation in online

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,200
social technical ecosystems like github

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
and in particular her most recent work

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
dismantles

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
such barriers to participation by taking

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,160
advantage of

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,800
identity deployment peer parity and

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,319
community mentorship uh i've always

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
liked on our website she

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,440
sums up her research at the slogan

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
targeted a few

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,879
and helped the many so before we

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
uh start the talk itself a few

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,280
housekeeping remarks

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,159
if you have questions for dna uh please

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,760
use the

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,319
q a feature of the go to web webinar

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,239
app to post these i will collect the

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
questions throughout the session

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,319
and at the end of dna will answer as

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,920
many of the questions live

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,959
as possible so with that today

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,959
please take it away

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,519
awesome

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
great thank you so much for that

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,680
marvelous introduction okay

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
so again i'm danae ford robinson

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
and today i'm going to talk to you all

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
about the golden rules of building

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,080
online communities that matter

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,599
specifically from identifying barriers

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,599
to participation

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,680
all the way to designing interventions

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,360
in the yahoo answers for programmers

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,080
and beyond so any

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
building communities that matter matters

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
really determined

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,640
by how people meaningfully engage in a

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,360
community

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,959
or if they do it all so much of my

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
research identifies how people

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
engage in these online deaf communities

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,360
and how they can bring their whole

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
selves to their technical work

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,239
and to get started i want to make sure

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,600
your wheels are turning in the right

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,840
direction

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
so i want you to close your eyes for 10

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,479
seconds

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,680
and i want you to imagine what a

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
software engineer

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
looks like

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,919
okay let's be honest you're probably

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
picturing someone that looks a lot like

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,240
this

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,919
but i would challenge you to shift your

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,960
thinking to the emerging diverse groups

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,800
of people

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
learning to code and thus entering the

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
technical workforce

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
there's a global emphasis on bringing

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,320
diverse people in technology

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
but what about the resources to keep

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,479
them there so my work tackles

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
step one of understanding the

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
experiences of underrepresented

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
programmers

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
and step two designing systems to better

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,600
support all programmers

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,600
essentially targeting the few to help

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
the money

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,440
and there's definitely quite a few who

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
need help um but my work focuses on

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
these two large communities for software

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
developers

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,639
so that's stack overflow and github much

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,680
of my work in the past i started with

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,759
stack overflow and

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
slowly transitioned to github so i'll

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,199
talk to you about both

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,199
but i'll start with stack the workflow

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
so for those of you who may not be

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,240
familiar

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,720
i mentioned stackoverflow being the

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,880
yahoo answers for programmers

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
but i went to this drive home that's

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
essentially a q a platform

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
where this is one of the 20 million

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,440
questions that exists on the

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,120
platform and one of the 30 million

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
answers

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,560
and as you can probably guess from the

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
millions of posts

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,759
there are a lot of people who contribute

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,479
but there's also quite a few who don't

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,120
and to really drive home that example i

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,800
want to

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,440
give you the perspective of this persona

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
aisha the programmer right so let's say

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,560
aisha is a

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
programmer a developer at a startup in

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
the bay area

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
and she's working on this code snippet

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,639
and she encounters this air that she's

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
not familiar with

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,880
so she constantly pays her air into bing

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,319
because we're on brand

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,080
um and lo and behold one of the top hits

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,160
is stock overflow so i you should find

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
this question scrolls down to the answer

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,840
and finds out well

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,039
this answer doesn't quite fit for what

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,039
work for my solution

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
so she says you know i'm just gonna i'm

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,759
gonna write my own question and get a

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,520
better answer

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,039
um and she finally messes up enough

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,160
courage to post

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,759
and then something happens uh we want to

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
figure out what happened to aisha and

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,759
other developers like aisha who

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
decide to engage in communities but then

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,479
don't um

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
one reason could be that she does not

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
see other users who

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,599
look like her post questions so on stack

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
overflow you can see

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
the avatar and the name of the

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,160
individual

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,400
who post the question and ask the

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,120
question

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,800
likewise on the in the community you can

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
see that there are modals that pop

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,720
up that say to prevent thanks and me too

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
from our new users um we protected this

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,599
question we blocked it

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
so she's not really familiar with the

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,639
community expectations

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,639
and what belongs in this community

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,759
also aisha may think her question is a

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,440
duplicate because it posts in the

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
when she types her title the list of

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
other similar questions pops up

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
and you see that there are also ones

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
with negative scores

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,199
um but also low answers so this can be

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,919
quite discouraging taisha

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
so these are many reasons uh why she may

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
not be posting

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
but there's also a lot of people who are

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
like her who

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,000
experience similar challenges because

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
it's like the world is watching them

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
when they're posting and messing up and

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
asking silly questions

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,800
well they're they're not quite wrong uh

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,680
on

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
stock overflow 50 million people visit

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,199
the site monthly

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,960
um so you should see people are coming

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
there to build careers and understand

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
programming questions

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
however only 12.9 million of those folks

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
have accounts

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,240
so against a small percentage of people

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
who actually actively engage in this

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
community

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,440
although many lurk so this breakdown

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
gets a little bit more discouraging when

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,599
we're referring to

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
uh different demographics so from the

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,279
recent stock overflow

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,719
developer survey from 2020 we're seeing

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
less than nine percent women and

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,640
non-binary

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
people and this is reasons that's

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,919
important because in comparison to large

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,279
tech companies there's like our average

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,640
around 20

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,640
so there's a star difference where you

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
can be online in any one you can be

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,519
anyone you want to be

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
however you're still discouraged people

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,320
are still discouraged

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,320
likewise if the third of the users are

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,440
engaged in this community

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
they have less than five years

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
experience so this goes to show that the

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
surge of interesting programming

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
uh is not over yet there's quite a few

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,399
people who are interested

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,680
um and feel comfortable who are actually

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
quite a few people who feel comfortable

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,279
actually engaging technically

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,040
and those who don't are missing out on a

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,360
huge economic advantage

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,440
so there are job postings that if you

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,240
even have the presence on stack overflow

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,680
you can get paid 30 an hour thirty to a

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
hundred dollars an hour if you have

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,519
twenty thousand points on stock overflow

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,480
or even own a popular open source

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,720
product

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
so again there's just these

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
opportunities that people are missing

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
out on

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,519
um and especially our underrepresented

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,279
developers in these spaces

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,560
so the problem i'm really trying to

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,720
drive home here is that

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,920
novices and unrepresented groups

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
encounter challenges

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,519
when participating in online programming

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,760
communities

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
but what makes it really hard to be able

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
to identify these challenges of these

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,600
groups

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,519
is that we want to do it without

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
ostracizing these people without

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,080
stereotyping them

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,839
so we want to be mindful of the

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
methodologies we take when studying

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,480
these groups

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,800
and today i'm going to be talking about

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,920
different ways to empower and identify

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
challenges people have in these

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
communities

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
um by setting up these golden rules we

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
should focus on

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,519
and how we're building communities and

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,640
how we want to be able to sustain

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,399
communities

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,000
so the first one i talk about is

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
identifying barriers

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
later i'll talk about you can provide

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
legitimate peripheral participation

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,480
through mentorship and i'll explain what

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
that means

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,640
um and then also we want to be

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
intentional about how we use identity

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
if that's how developers are evaluating

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
each other

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
so first i'll cover these two research

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
questions um

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
for this identifying barriers golden

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,160
rule

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
so we wanted to figure out what barriers

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,279
do women face with engaging on stock

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,040
overflow

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,360
and later how these barriers vary by

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
gender so we started with women because

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
the squeaky wheel gets the oil

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,040
women are women and underrepresented uh

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,560
genders are the people who are facing

00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
challenges where we see that there are

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
low

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,640
uh representation in this community of

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,720
these interviews we did service

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
expanding it to you beyond binary

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
genders as well

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,320
so we started off with semi-structured

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,079
interviews from 22 women

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
we even had one of our participants

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,240
identify uh being in the stack overflow

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
top 100 of all time

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
and they had a range of demographics

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
some were students some were

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
professionals

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
we had a big good bit of lurkers and

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
some active users

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,040
and essentially we asked them about

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,120
their personal issues of the community

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
how people communicate on the site some

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
incentives that may encourage them to

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,200
participate

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,760
and and what are some that may encourage

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,800
others to participate

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,959
i'll spare you the analysis details

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,959
but long story short we conducted a

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,240
thematic analysis on the transcripts on

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,279
the interview transcripts

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,320
identified 327 barrier statements

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,000
which resulted in 14 barriers to save

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
you time i won't go through all 14

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
barriers

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,040
but i'll cover three um and three of

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,399
them actually resonate with a lot of us

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
in the audience even outside of

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,200
programming communities

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,760
so one participant mentioned

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,480
uh that i don't feel like my expertise

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
is enough

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
for me to actually post an answer on

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,000
stack overflow that is

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,480
that will be of any help to anyone else

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
and this we call this qualifications

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,560
barrier

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,839
but this sounds like something we've

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,959
heard in other offline communities as

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,800
well in process intro

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
right not feeling like i have enough to

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,959
bring to the table to

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
be here so we see it's interesting to

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,040
see here

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,560
that a lot of these challenges that

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
we'll talk about that people face in

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
online communities

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
they face them offline as well but i

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
guess

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,360
as researchers and scientists we

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,680
expected or some folks expected

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,519
that being online having control of your

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,560
identity can empower people but it also

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,399
can have disadvantages as well

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,440
another barrier was this onboarding

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,440
hoops so one participant went on to say

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
i feel like everyone else already knows

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,720
what it is to post

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
um and i want to stay away from that

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
extra work to figure out

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
how to use it just figuring out what the

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
etiquette is and all the little social

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
things too

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
are just kind of unspoken and kind of

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,120
daunting

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
so this sounds familiar um we heard

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,720
aisha's story earlier right these

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,560
unfamiliar noise people are facing

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,160
and it can be quite discouraging

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,360
finally um this last barrier which is a

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,519
sphere of negative feedback

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,839
participants mentioned you know it's

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,600
hard enough to ask for help

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,040
but then to ask for help and then get

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
rude help

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,200
you're kind of like never mind you kind

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,320
of gotta forget it um

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,040
and we uh call this this conflict

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
fatigue

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
right of just always being disappointed

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
when you're asking for help and

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,920
you already had a must-have enough

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,720
courage to do it and you have these

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,320
scars

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
right and how do you overcome them

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,000
essentially so participants really

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,399
describe scenarios like that as well

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,040
so finally after we identified these

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,360
barriers

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,399
that existed we wanted to figure out how

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
they varied across

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,279
genders right so for the purpose of this

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,000
work for our analysis we included

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,079
a binary gender of men and women but i

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,639
do want to note that these barriers did

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,800
exist

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
for people across the spectrum we just

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,279
use these binary genders

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,720
for our stat analysis so we conducted

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
the wilcoxon ranks them

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
and i just wanted to itemize the

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,320
barriers here and show you that

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,399
these barriers are not dimorphisms it's

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
not that all women

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,079
said that the fear of negative feedback

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,480
is a challenge for me it's not that all

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,240
men

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
said the stranger discomfort were

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
challenged with them there is a mix

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
across the spectrum for all these

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
barriers

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
um and i just wanted to really highlight

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
that these are challenges

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,120
that exist although we targeted the few

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,639
we're finding that these challenges

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,920
resonate with the many

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,279
and can disempower that many um so our

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,040
observations from this

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,800
two observations i want to highlight are

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,240
that there are two types of language

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
that contributors

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
experience this unwelcoming atmosphere

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,720
and this

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,240
uh boys club this idol boys club chatter

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,079
participants described it

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
as they want to engage but they don't

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,279
really feel like they belong

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
likewise people had helpful intentions

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,240
where participants wanted to

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
to contribute but didn't feel like they

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,519
can and

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
based on how challenging it was for them

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
to find opportunities to either

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,199
post questions that would be valuable or

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
even provide answers that people will

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,839
find insightful

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,360
finally i do want to highlight some of

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,360
the amazing

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
uh why it's important to kind of do this

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,759
type of work so

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,320
jeff atwood who is a founder of stock

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
overflow

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,600
kind of acknowledged the work and how

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,160
this can really help

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
novices engage in the community so at

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,680
the time they were working on

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,720
a couple features about uh highlighting

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
new contributors and

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,000
highlighting the code of conduct um

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,519
likewise what's been really helpful uh

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
or something that i like to do with most

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,360
of my research is

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
blog about each of the papers that get

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
published and the

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
research that we're doing because let's

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
be real

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
software developers are not going to

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,279
read our long research papers i mean

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,040
most scientists don't also read everyone

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
else's features papers either

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,560
so we wanted to put it in a digestible

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,240
format so that people can

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,839
the developer specifically the community

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,480
we're trying to target can give us

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
feedback

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
and tell us what type of interventions

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,120
they want to see or

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,279
how they resonated with some of these

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,680
findings and you can find the blog on my

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,040
website there at blog.dnaport.me

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,920
and you'll see other developers

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,160
commenting on content and research as

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
well

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,959
okay so next step next important rule

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,680
is providing mentorship as in empowering

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,880
people

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,959
to engage so i already covered a bit of

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
this novice experience where i mentioned

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,759
that

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,959
questions are ill-received where there's

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,600
negative threes and

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,199
zeros on question scores but there's

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
also these questions that don't feel

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,480
like they follow community etiquette

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,399
so from a blog that was shared someone

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,400
commented on facebook and said

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
more often than not my posts get down

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,439
voted because i didn't know

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
how to follow some arcane etiquette and

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,000
again

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,959
people are interested in computing or in

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
contributing

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,360
but don't know how so another person

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
commented and said is there some trick

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,600
to making it worthwhile

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
to post on stack overflow and what's a

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,600
way

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,199
to find value so this uh begs us to ask

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,000
this research question which is

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
how can users engage novices to ask well

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
receive questions because we know there

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
are people in the community finding

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
value

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,120
we know that there are people trying to

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
find value where do we bridge that gap

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,280
how do we bridge it

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,320
so to understand that we're looking at

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
stack overflow as

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,760
a community of practice where learning

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,760
is peripheral

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
and people are learning by watching

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,200
others do a task

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,559
so comparable to see uh to have people

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,400
engage on wikipedia

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
we can check the edit history and see

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
what people have edited

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,360
and there's also features like this

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,600
wikipedia tea house which

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
allows you to guide novices through that

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
first experience

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
and through how to contribute so for

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
here we're looking through mutual

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,919
engagement

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
where newcomers can watch experts engage

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
and

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,039
learn from that

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,760
to understand these design principles

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,280
more concretely we designed this pilot

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
on slack and again this was in

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
collaboration with stack overflow

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,400
so we worked with christina lustig

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
jeffrey banks at the time

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,559
christine was one of the first

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,320
researchers that stacked overflow and

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,200
jeffrey banks was our developer

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,120
who's helping us build out these systems

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
um we conducted a pilot

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,640
and we learned a lot a lot of things

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,120
went right but also some things went

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
wrong

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
um but what we did wanted to know moving

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
forward was that we found out how

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,840
valuable it was

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
to allow mistakes in a private space so

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
giving newcomers opportunity to ask this

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
elite questions

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
figure out the norms of how people

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,919
engage

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,679
in a space a safe space to make them

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,160
like it's okay to mess up and to not get

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,440
it right

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,120
on the first try um also in this space

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,320
we found that it was important

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,200
to provide formative and timely feedback

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,400
so again we didn't helpful for novices

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
to get help

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
to post a question and get an answer

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
like two days later

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
no i've been posting the question i need

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
the answer or not right um so we went to

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
make sure they were getting feedback

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,720
similarly how they get the feedback on

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
stock exchange

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
and finally we wanted to make sure you

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
were adding value to have people already

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
use the community

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,039
so stock overflow there's already you

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
post a question and you get an answer

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,640
but so we didn't want to do exactly that

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,160
we wanted to teach people

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
how to do that so teach them the fish

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,960
not fish for them so we didn't want to

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,039
answer the questions

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,039
but help them to ask better questions

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,840
so from this pilot we decided that our

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
next implement this feature

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,440
uh called collaborative editing on stack

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,720
overflows platform

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,120
and it had two core components

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,840
first was this collaborative question

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,240
draft

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,480
where here you can see that there is the

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
same type of markdown text you use to

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
enter your title

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,360
into the list of tags in the body of

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,000
your question well we just recreated

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
that in

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
one of the staff overflow chat rooms

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,760
right we just had a dedicated space

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
well then we call it a help room to

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,919
discuss and edit those types of drafts

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
um so it's kind of what i really want

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,240
important uh what i want to point out

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
here

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
is that we are using existing

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
infrastructure

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,480
right and building on top of that and

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,360
explicitly calling it the safe space

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
um this help room a place to empower and

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,840
i think that's important

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
as we think about the new communities

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,720
that we build in the future like how do

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
we take advantage of existing

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,520
infrastructure

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,600
but reshape it for something intentional

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,200
so to test out this intervention of how

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
these collaborative drafts work

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
we conducted this just-in-time

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,960
mentorship study where we had over 70

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,159
000 eligible novices

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,960
um we had 63 mentors

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
the 70 000 ended up going down to 520

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,600
who actually entered the room and

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,760
engaged with mentors

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,799
um but we learned a lot and we saw some

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,760
interesting results

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,760
from that help room so over 30 days we

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,120
saw that the mentored questions

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,880
had a 50 score increase on average so 50

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,640
higher score than the questions that

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,200
were not mentored

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,360
so using stock overflows very complex

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
analytics uh combinations that where

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,200
negative scores are bad

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,200
anything that's negative is bad and

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
anything that's positive scores or you

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,120
can upvote the question

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,480
uh is good uh we saw less bad questions

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,159
and more good questions um

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,000
so it was just really interesting again

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,720
to see how the community

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
perceives you so the reason upvotes are

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
important is and down votes are

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
important because that's how the

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
community receives your question how

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
they find value in your question

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,880
so we wanted to measure based on the

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,880
metrics that currently exist

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,799
uh one of the also interesting findings

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,840
from this work

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,960
is that we conducted a lot thematic

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
analysis on the

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,200
types of dialogue that mentors have with

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
novices and we saw that mentor suggested

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
some pretty high fidelity for

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
improvements

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,600
um i won't go over all of them i just

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
highlight this culture of asking

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,440
um so what mentors did suggest other

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
things like formatting

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,440
community triage such as where the

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,280
community uh where this post belongs

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,039
which community this post belongs in

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,720
and how to frame your question how to

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,720
add the right structure to it

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,720
but this culture of asking was quite

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,320
interesting so i'll highlight one quote

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,520
from a participant or from a couple

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
participants

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,840
um so in the help room one mentor

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,720
actually says the novice

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,880
you know you also may want to edit out

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,600
thank you at the end of your question

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,559
i know it seems polite but people on

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,679
stack overflow

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,520
object to it and this is just a uh an

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
image of another question that has thank

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
you very much and also has a negative

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
score

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
i'm not to say that the thank you very

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
much is the reason it had a negative

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
score

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,520
but it's interesting to see that you do

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,679
see questions like this on the platform

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,039
um and then the mentor followed up and

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,320
mentioned to the novice

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,679
um while it's good to be social

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,159
it's kind of just fluff on a q a site

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
and what was really powerful quote this

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,159
powerful quote from the novice said you

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
know

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
okay thanks for your help and i hope

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
this time

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,760
people won't attack me um so it's

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,640
interesting to see first that you know

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,640
people have

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,840
these dialogues these banters that

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,080
happen in the comments

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,960
that can be discouraging and sometimes

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,960
we brush them off

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,000
but what we notice here is that this

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
novice mentioned that

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,520
you know they felt attacked they felt

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
targeted it felt a little bit more

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,039
personal than it needed to be

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,480
um and it was interesting to have that

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,440
document and figuring out like

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
okay we're adding value somewhere and

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,640
now this is

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,960
uh less than three questions are finding

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
it valuable

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,159
so looking forward to where that study

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,480
goes next so

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
um one thing last final thing i want to

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
highlight from the study

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,039
is that mentors use identity as a signal

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,240
in some way to empower each other

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,720
so at the end of one of our chats we saw

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,799
that

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,799
a mentor after they helped the knox with

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,039
a question had said

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,440
hey you know i noticed your name are you

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,200
from egypt by chance

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,559
and it's funny because i think christine

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,559
and i were both in the help room at this

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
time when it happened and then the

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,279
novice

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
said you know yeah actually i am i

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,240
thought i picked up on your name too

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,840
we thought it was going to be some type

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,480
of code of content

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
uh violation of privacy but it was kind

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
of interesting to see here

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,480
how the mentor and an office the manager

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
may have been selecting that novice to

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,679
help

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,400
based on their location so stock

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,720
exchange

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,440
exactly you can see your country your

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,400
name

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,960
as users describe them to be on the

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,679
website

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,880
self-reported information so interesting

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
it makes us think about

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
the ways that identity can be an

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,679
advantage and how people are

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,720
using that as a signal to engage

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
or a signal to choose who to help and

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,520
who to empower

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
so that they are not the only ones

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,000
engaging

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,360
i do want to highlight some of the

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
impact from the just-in-time mentorship

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,720
and how valuable some folks from the

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,799
community saw

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,400
so jay helen who at the time at sac

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,640
overflow was the executive vice

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,279
president of culture and experience

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,120
really acknowledged how this mentorship

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,000
or this coaching experiment

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,600
forged a new experience for novices and

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,720
kind of resulted in this

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
question asking template for novices um

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,000
and figuring out testing out new

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,279
interventions right it really encouraged

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,440
the spirit of

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,640
um let's do a study let's test out and

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,520
see what works

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,440
so julia social at the time was also a

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,919
data scientist that stock overflow

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
um really open up this program for other

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,799
people

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
to conduct other studies on stack

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,679
overflows platform

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
so at the bottom of my slide it's kind

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,720
of hard to see there but i'll be sure to

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,799
post these slides publicly

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,039
and you can see that there is a link as

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
a call for papers essentially a call for

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,240
academic partnerships

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,760
so i want to encourage all of your

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,080
scientists listening as well to

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
um reach out to these organizations and

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,880
their studies and i found that it was

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
really helpful for us

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,000
for the blogs that we shared um to

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,240
connect with

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,679
uh industry at that time and i just want

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
to make sure that everyone

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,080
takes advantage of those opportunities

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,799
to do impactful work

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,480
and finally we're currently talking to

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,240
github discussions team

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,480
to support newcomers so those who were

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,480
tuning in into the

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
the what was that satellite that just

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
passed there were

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,720
representations talking a lot about the

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,640
new opportunities to empower newcomers

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,480
and support maintainers and we're trying

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,960
to figure out how some of these concepts

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,400
of legitimate peripheral participation

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,640
which is just watching others and

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
coaching others do that first task

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,760
can help people feel more engaged and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,760
find value in their contributions

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
so one of the last golden rules i wanted

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,159
to

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,559
touch on for the main meet of this talk

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,840
uh

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,799
was being intentional about identity and

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,279
this work was mostly done um on github

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
so

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,400
i think a lot of people may be

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,320
interested in this findings

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,799
so simply put pull request

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,039
excuse me all the decoupled process of

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,480
submitting code to repository and having

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,559
it reviewed

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
where the main points of the process

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,960
we're going to focus on we're really

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
this

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
idea of when you submit your pull

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
request like you submit your code for

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,480
review

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,760
and then when it's merged um

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,000
however there's quite a bit of my

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,640
clarity in the decision making process

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
that happens before is accepted um

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,600
before people

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,440
merge or close or before they accept or

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,039
reject your pull requests

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,720
oftentimes the decision can be made

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,679
behind the scenes and it's not explicit

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,039
to the contributor

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,159
or the project owner um so i'm really

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,000
trying to figure out

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,320
explicitly what types of signals people

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
are valuable or finding valuable

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
and which ones we should be amplifying

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,120
or which ones people are already

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,520
amplifying and focusing on

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,360
um should we divert their attention so

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,600
specifically using the context of github

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,320
where your profile image is very visible

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,039
um so on the github about your profile

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,039
page in 2019

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,480
it highlighted that your profile is

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,440
about your repositories you're

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,039
interested in

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,600
the contributions you've made and the

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,799
conversations you've had

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,480
but is that enough and is that all

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,520
developers are using to interpret

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,840
a story about a pulver request so this

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
is

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,960
an example of a profile page on on

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,399
github

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,559
are there refined details that people

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,559
are using are the indicators of a

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,039
popular repository

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,320
uh the contributions you made in the

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,039
projects to

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,080
cut a project that you've contributed to

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,159
are those actually interesting to

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,440
reviewers

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,600
um or is it the language

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,679
of the repositories the density of your

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,600
contribution heat map

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,600
or is it the context of the code that

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,440
makes more sense

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,559
so to understand more of this process of

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,399
signals i'm really trying to understand

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
how programmers review and trust

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,000
technical signals from each other

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,600
so we're in the study uh where if if for

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
pull requests in the single commit of a

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,720
pull request if

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,159
it was truly a meritocracy then the only

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,240
thing that should matter

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,679
is the single commit the couple lines of

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,720
code from

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,240
the pull request but

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,760
it may be valuable that the peripheral

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,399
technical information is interesting too

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,320
which is what you see in blue here

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,480
but also social signals which are in

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
green um which are things that tell you

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
the identity of the user

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,360
where they're from their popularity

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,120
based on their repositories and

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,720
followers and following

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,559
may also be valuable but in fact we even

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
see it may be valuable based on this

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,039
experiment we conducted

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,559
where before accepting or merging this

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,720
pull request

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,240
or deciding to accept their merge this

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
developer went through

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,559
and looked at how to look back at the

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,120
profile page to make a decision

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,399
so i'll run that back one more time so

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
there's the single commit the pull

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,360
request

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,679
that's me that's my my hair in the

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,600
background they click on the profile

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
page to go back through and look at the

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,799
avatar image

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,240
the contribution heat map and the recent

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,720
contribution activity before making a

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,720
decision

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,720
so i'm really interested in in the

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,159
initial question for this study really

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
are how do programmers

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,159
review pull requests where do

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,080
programmers think they look versus where

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,399
they actually look

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,919
um and what strategies they use but i

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,799
won't cover too much of the strategies

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,159
they use yet

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,840
i'm going to talk about that for some of

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,039
the vision work

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,799
but i'm going to try to zoom through the

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,480
technical details but i think it's

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,960
important that i show you

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,200
um so from our sample we actually had

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,640
the large samples over 42 participants

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,520
and they all reviewed two

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,120
uh profiles and two pull requests but

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,200
for the sample for this paper we

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,840
actually used 20 participants

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
and where we had uh over 11 i think we

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,919
had about 11

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,799
uh pull requests that were reasonable to

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,720
accept

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,399
uh or unreasonable to accept and nine

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,000
that were so neither they should have

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,200
been accepted and 11

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,240
that should have been declined however

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,919
we only saw 12 correct decisions so like

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,360
12 that were true accepts or true right

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,880
um and we also seen that there was also

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,960
though we have our code signals which

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,320
are the primary contribution developers

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240
should be looking at

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,080
there's also a comparison between how

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,600
often they're looking at code signals

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,600
and some of the social signals even

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,760
though they make up less of the content

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,840
on the page

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,360
so i'll just show you this but i don't

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,320
need you to read this figure it's hard

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,480
to read

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,720
uh what i do want to highlight again

00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,559
here is that the code signals which are

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
ideally the primary technical

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,440
contribution developers spent majority

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,840
of their time

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,519
looking there secondly the technical

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,640
signals the peripheral the peripheral

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,559
information

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
but then finally the social which is the

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
smallest amount of entity

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
but a screen real estate the smallest

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,880
amount of area of interest

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
um but should also be the least

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
important if things are in meritocracy

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
but i did want to highlight this idea

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,399
that or at this point that we saw a 5

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,840
out of 20 of our participants

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,279
spent 48 to 62 percent of their time

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,120
fixating

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,480
as in their eye movements focusing on

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,360
technical signals

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,640
and above average time on social signals

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,320
it's important to note this because

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,679
social signals again make up the least

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,200
amount of areas of interest on the page

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
and to figure out how developers

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,559
actually found this valuable

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,880
i wanted to compare i asked them you

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,279
know what signals did you find valuable

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
and which ones did you actually look at

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,720
from what i had from

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,519
our eye movement data so this is the

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,279
ranged

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,559
uh stacked chart here a dot plot here

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,120
um the orange here highlights the code

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,840
signals

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,720
so we saw at 73 reported using the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,559
co-snippet

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,159
to make a decision which ideally should

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,000
have been 100 right

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,640
um 45 percent uh noticed using

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,320
the uh previous contributions the other

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,640
peripheral technical information

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,519
and honestly only one person only one

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
participant

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
mentioned using the avatar image

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,039
although all

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
all participants did so the way to read

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,240
this chart again

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,039
is this is the post survey where

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,720
participants

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,720
list how many uh contributions and

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,399
uh avatar or areas of interest they

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,399
focus on and then

00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,919
what we have here is the eye movements

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,159
of how much people focus on

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,399
so if there's a the way you read this is

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,320
that if there's a large distance between

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,000
both items that means the big

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,120
discrepancy between what people

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,679
reviewed and what they said they

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,240
reviewed and we see there's a big

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,080
difference

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
between how people are honest about the

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,240
social signals they're reviewing

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,519
versus what they actually reviewed and

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,600
this is not the call

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,200
developers are liars that's not the

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,399
point here the point was that there are

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,159
social signals

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,480
that are being used so does viewing this

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,559
content necessarily mean that this

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,639
information influence the decision well

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
we're using the i my hypotheses that if

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,800
you're looking at something

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,240
that means it's you're tending to it now

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,119
we need to figure out to determine how

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,320
much value it

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,679
is but the major takeaway here

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,359
is that people are using their social

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,200
and human capital explicitly

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,720
people are using the technical values

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,560
that people have and bring to the

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,639
platform but also using

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,480
the social ones as in what they look

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,040
like their name

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,720
um the avatar image so we want to if

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,399
people are using this maybe we want to

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,320
be strategic about how we deploy

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,159
identity and how we give people control

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
over that identity

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,159
so there's a couple open questions here

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,960
um how do signals

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,800
change based on the code attributes

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,000
peripheral code attributes like

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,440
if i change what country i'm from or the

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
names of the projects if

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,839
the project i'm doing i submitted my

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,000
pull request on is about games

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,359
does my resume does my profile page show

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
that i've already done a lot of other

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,520
games

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,119
does it matter does that previous

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,760
experience matter

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,800
um but we should really think about how

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,839
we can build tools

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,920
to better reflect contributions or

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,359
or should we should we be directing

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,240
developers attentions

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,920
one way or the other um but at the very

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,000
least we know we should be able

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,400
to be intentional about how we design

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,079
systems to facilitate this process in

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,079
open source communities

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,079
this really business to ask the question

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,240
um again

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,440
what does asking for help in the future

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,320
look like

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,400
um and i really like to draw on this

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,359
quote from bogdan vaselescu who's

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,680
another researcher

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,880
studying this space at carnegie mellon

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,800
and

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,160
this quote he says is the software is

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,320
being developed by

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,920
increasingly distributed and

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
increasingly diverse groups of

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
individuals

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,680
i would posit that how our programmers

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,960
identity is presented

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,560
will become increasingly influential um

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,359
i mean we have not evolved to be able to

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,119
control our identity automatically

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,839
our fact that communities have been

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,240
emphasizing it so i really want us to

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,960
like

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,920
really give ourselves some far out there

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,680
thoughts and

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
space to be creative and think about

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,720
different ways we can evolve as a

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,880
community

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,560
so as online communities evolve we see

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,280
you just having more variety

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,800
and levels of privacy and control and

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,960
how they share content

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
but this is also evident when we're

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
asking about

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,119
questions or asking questions in a

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,640
private team to help communities so

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,079
sometimes i'll ask private questions to

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,119
my colleagues because i feel more

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
comfortable

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
um think about people post on social

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,680
media like on instagram and facebook you

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,599
have

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,440
the ability to post to a close group of

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,880
friends

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,560
um but with that being said can we now

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,000
enhance the control of how we ask

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
questions or who we show our pull

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,079
requests to

00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,720
to specialize audiences

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,880
can we take advantage of this anonymity

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,480
right this segmented anonymity of like

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,160
we're only going to show

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
different parts of our profile page to

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,680
certain people because we feel

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,640
comfortable with them

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,119
uh should we do that how how can we do

00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,200
that

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,800
that's a better question i think we move

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,320
past should i think we know that

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,000
having control over how you share

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,040
yourself is important

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,480
um but further as our traditionally

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,800
technical spaces

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,839
like github become more social so here

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,480
you see that there's

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,760
the uh you set your status and you can

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,359
have like an icon

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
i kind of mocked up that close friends

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
thing but i want us to think about how

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
we share different parts of ourselves

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
with others

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,240
but as our traditionally technical

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,160
spaces like github become more social

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,000
and as our traditionally social spaces

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,160
like facebook become more technical

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,800
here's someone asking for java sdk is on

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,560
facebook right how do we

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,000
manage this context collapse across

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,520
platforms

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,359
does this allow us to bring more of our

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,280
authentic selves

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,800
to our technical work through the image

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
of people pinning

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,440
cute photos of their children to their

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,440
profile page on github

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,440
so i'm interested in studying how

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
programmers

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,200
so

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,040
there was a study i did in 2018

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
about

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,440
hope you obviously hear me there's a

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,720
study i did in 2018

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,640
about understanding developer signals

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,000
um and their identity and we found that

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
connecting individuals through an

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,800
identifiable

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,680
marginalized identity

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,560
awesome marginalized identity can enrich

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,880
the experience

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,640
of being the only one and thus

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,400
encouraging empowerment

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,000
but how can we create that for

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,079
marginalized identities

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
that shared only oneness was what people

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,640
find valuable

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,400
right um but simply put if marginalized

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,800
people are not engaging in the popular

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
deep

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,480
programming communities that we are

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,000
engaging in then where are they seeking

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,079
help

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,920
where are they going for help more

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,440
importantly can we have our communities

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,119
look more like that

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,520
so there are communities like ask

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,520
questions.tech which brands itself as an

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
inclusive space to ask technical

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,720
questions

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,800
likewise our studio has been intentional

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
about encouraging developers to always

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
be civil

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,680
in their community and those python

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,119
tutor tool which kind of highlights

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,359
different countries and regions people

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,520
are coming from

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,599
um can we make our communities can be

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,119
intentional about the rules

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,160
explicit beyond just the code of conduct

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,280
uh and even empower developers beyond

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,440
those communities

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,040
so another question here is how can we

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,280
better empower

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,720
global south programmers so programmers

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,480
from these emerging regions to

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,160
contribute to open source

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,400
so to be specific on grid hub

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,400
they're seeing a growth of developers

00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,480
from emerging contributing countries

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,599
so this is from the october survey from

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,400
a couple of

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,160
october report from a couple years ago

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,839
um and what we're seeing is that

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,280
the emergence some of the places that

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,440
are on this list

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
the regions is common for people in

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,560
these regions to have mobile devices

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,839
rather than a laptop

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,839
so with the emergence of github mobile

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,640
and with opportunity to create even more

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,319
devs for these from these regions

00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,319
further in the stock overflow developer

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,160
survey from the past couple of years

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,480
visual studio code has been ranked as

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,400
one of the top popular environment tools

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,319
with over 50 percent of respondents

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,160
claiming to use it

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,680
if majority of developers are using

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,760
visual studio

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,000
does this create a unique opportunity to

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,920
grow and encourage developers to from

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
these emerging countries to be builders

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,280
of these systems um

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,280
to be contributors builders of platforms

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,920
you know other unique opportunities to

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,359
empower marginalized developers

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,640
to build these extensions basically

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,480
but can we even be a little bit more

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,720
explicit about that

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,839
can we intentionally craft opportunities

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,000
to invite diverse perspectives to the

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,839
table

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,839
be equitable with the resources to build

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,960
and then inclusively sustain

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,200
participation

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,000
or give the resources to the same

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,200
participation

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,599
as a contributor i'm interested in

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,760
seeing

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,440
what this looks like then it's important

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,359
to note that it's not the job of the

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,319
marginalized populations to build these

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,560
systems

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,319
but it is important to us as allies and

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,839
as researchers to advocate

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,240
to foster spaces that can make this

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,800
happen

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,079
um and that as i'm starting to close

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,599
here i wanted to

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,880
really highlight and when we think about

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,000
how do we it's our jobs our

00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
responsibility

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,280
to treat others the way we want to be

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,839
treated which is the original golden

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,040
rule

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,040
right but there's more

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,880
there's more voter rules that matter and

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,480
i'm actually kind of curious to hear

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,920
your golden rules that matter if the

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,200
communities that you've built whether or

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,000
not you're a developer

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,520
or your online facebook group or your

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
online technical community of how you

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,359
talk about your professional work

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,359
um there are some rules like be

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,200
welcoming which i know

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,560
the code newbies community that saron

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,119
has developed is really

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,200
intentional about this um there's rules

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,480
like making governance explicit so amy

00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,280
zhang who's at the university of

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,119
washington

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
and jay nathan matthias who's at cornell

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,640
are looking at different governance

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,800
models of how to empower developers

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,400
um develop forms of legitimate

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,560
peripheral participation

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,720
i talked about mentorship so if you're

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,800
steinbacher who's at northern arizona

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,680
university and amita sarma who's at

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,920
oregon state

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,839
are looking at a lot of amazing ways of

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,880
mentorship for newcomers and how to get

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,839
newcomers started

00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,480
and their pathways so there's a lot of

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,920
ways

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,440
and rules that we should be considering

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,400
for how we build our communities and

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,599
some apply to

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,079
our specific communities more than

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,839
others one of my

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,200
golden rules as a researcher and as a

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
ally to figure out how to support

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,000
developers in this space

00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,839
is to have amazing collaborators so here

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,880
i want to give a big shout out to all my

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,440
collaborators

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,160
and even my more amazing interns and

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,079
visitors

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,760
virtual visitors we have this summer who

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,079
are working on amazing work to

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,440
empower developers through open source

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,319
software through

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,079
social impact projects social good

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,160
supporting developer communities for

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,000
blind and low vision programmers

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,760
also for supporting developer identity

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,839
through youtube the machine learning

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,440
models and onboarding developers even in

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,800
the offline space

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,839
so to close i want to

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,440
do a short recap that online communities

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,440
there are a lot of unfamiliar norms that

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,920
developers and newcomers are

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,680
not really familiar with but there's

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,319
interventions and we can design

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,240
systems and we can build rules in place

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,880
have rules in place to empower people to

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,640
join

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,560
um such as just-in-time mentorship what

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,400
i talked about earlier

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,839
but as we think about the rules that we

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,240
may already have set in place

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,680
what are the new ones we can build up

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,000
where how can we be intentional about

00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,839
identity for example as a rule

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
and attention about editing look

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,319
different for every community

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,760
so i'm really curious to hear what you

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,560
all have already started

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,000
um what are you thinking about and i

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,440
empower you all to

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,599
do the work to make it happen

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:05,839
so with that i'll close and i thank you

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:05,839
all for your time

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,520
thanks very much today i'll say our

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,000
tremendously

00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,960
thought-provoking uh talk um

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,400
for all the participants are you uh do

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,000
you have an opportunity to

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,119
ask questions uh as i

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,839
said previously please use the

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,839
uh cure

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,839
uh oh i think i lost your audio there oh

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,640
good decide to go to the rural sales

00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,160
community

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,200
i'm sorry i kind of lost your audio

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,200
there i just got you back

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,240
okay wonderful thank you all right so uh

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,760
you mentioned these golden rules uh how

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,960
did you decide these were the rules that

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,839
the community should follow

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,839
uh where did the

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,720
rules come yeah so yeah so the rules

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,760
really came from talking to people in

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,800
the community and

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,119
looking at literature right so we know

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,359
that

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,599
in offline communities uh offline

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,599
technical communities is important to

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,280
have empowerment for folks so think

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,280
about how a large tech

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,800
organization or any tech company that

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,839
there are these affinity groups to

00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,920
empower

00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,839
women or to power lgbtqa plus people

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,119
right and empower black developers

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,040
latinx developers

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
and we want to figure out how to build

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,400
systems that support them

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,680
so looking at literature from the

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,599
offline spaces

00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,880
and talking to developers like having

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,240
conversations

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,599
um face-to-face hard right now but zoom

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,119
and go-to meeting are great

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,680
opportunities and teams because we're on

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,680
brand

00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,440
uh are very helpful resources for that

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,280
so i would encourage community builders

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,680
to talk to their users and receive that

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
feedback

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,280
great um so you also mentioned the

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,800
mentorship mentorship program that you

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,800
did with stack overflow

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,359
what do you think could make that such a

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,880
big success is it something we can

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,480
replicate elsewhere yeah so i think what

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,400
really made that really awesome

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,520
our work with the stack overflow program

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,760
is that

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,680
we were explicit about who we wanted to

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,760
help and we figured out which challenge

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,480
people had in the beginning

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,760
and figured out that from that work we

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,040
were able to outline

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,960
what were the specific things

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,640
participants mentioned that were

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,800
valuable in their experience

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,640
and when they tried to post for the ones

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,400
that didn't quite make it over the hump

00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,920
we also find it valuable to talk to

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
those who did make it over the hump

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,920
so we were able to have perspective of

00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,160
the lurkers and the active users

00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,200
and be explicit and extract their

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,119
responses

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,800
and use their suggestions to figure out

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,160
or interpret their suggestions

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,079
when they weren't able to describe them

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,319
in full context

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,160
to build those systems so the mentorship

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,760
program it was an amazing collaboration

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,559
with stack overflow and it really came

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,559
from

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,040
writing the blog right so wrote the

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,720
paper jeff atwood tweeted about the work

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,680
um but when they tweet about the work

00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,200
and they talk about it they're not

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,040
talking about the long paper

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,040
right they're talking about the blog

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,400
which was helpful and digestible

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,240
so i think it was helpful that

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,839
developers were also

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,440
able to receive and give feedback on the

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,119
program because we asked them in the

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
meta stack overflow community

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,160
we were like we're building the system

00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,920
what should it look like

00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:03,030
getting feedback at all those stages was

00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:06,069
very helpful i think

00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:06,069
[Music]

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,960
for a researcher to use media can

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,119
[Music]

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,960
okay i think you were saying the

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,079
motivations for writing the papers or

00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,280
writing the writing the blogs to

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,960
supplement the papers

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,880
correct okay

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:37,920
yes so why why are you using blogs

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,040
lastly uh

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,040
as a way of communicating

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,119
yeah so the the blogs the intentions

00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,680
behind the blogs again

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,680
um they started off as a selfish reason

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:54,480
for myself to figure out

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,400
how i need to digest the work how can i

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,920
communicate the motivations of the

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,920
work and make it impactful um likewise i

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,839
wanted it to be an opportunity

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,119
again to reach the community that i was

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,839
trying to help

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,839
and i think as researchers and allies in

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,079
these spaces we're trying to

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,440
build systems for people but if the

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,760
people don't want them

00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,559
if they don't find it valuable if they

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,240
don't see

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,760
that your work is happening then what's

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,520
the point um so

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,440
that's just my perspective of how i like

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,440
to do this type of work

00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,520
so although all the developers in the

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,000
world are not reading my blogs

00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,000
um if they wanted to they're there you

00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
know i can at least take an attempt

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
to reach them because i'm trying to help

00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:45,650
[Music]

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,839
how

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:09,839
i'm sorry i couldn't hear that last one

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:09,839
is anyway you can type it in chat

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,599
you talk about the golden rules as they

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,079
are today

00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,079
do you think the rules will change and

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,920
if so

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:32,000
yes so i think i think rules do change

00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,839
um and i think it's important that the

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
rules also thing i did not know is that

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,119
the rules change with the community size

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,720
right if your developer community if

00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,160
it's just your project your open source

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,920
project and there's only five of your

00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,839
buddies working on it

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,160
then the rules may be a little more

00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,160
implicit and if you just got started on

00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,240
the project into such a small group

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,680
then they're going to grow as your

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,000
community grows

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,599
as you attract more developers as you

00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,760
bring new perspectives from

00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,760
different regions um but i think it's

00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,800
important to at least have some type of

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,960
rules set up

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,800
so when you're inviting people in they

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,680
know that they're structured here

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,520
they know that they're they have

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,119
mechanisms in place to make them feel

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,200
safe if something ever happens and they

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,800
don't feel supported um because the goal

00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,440
again is to make

00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,119
everyone feel supported um and even if

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,760
it's just your buddies at the first five

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,280
group

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
um eventually you might want to grow

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,040
that project and you want to already

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,720
have an

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,839
environment there that's welcoming for

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,960
that so i definitely see rules changing

00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,240
over time for each project for each

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,800
target demographic of people you're

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,520
trying to bring

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,520
to your project
