we look at the future of development

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
developer experiences and try to figure

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,480
out how to make

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,520
development faster safer easier more

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
accessible

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,760
add fine jazz

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,920
different our guest is

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,760
github star sean wang better known by

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,039
his internet handle swix

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
and we'll also be joined by uh brian

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
douglas aka b

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,520
dougie who is a developer advocate and

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,640
educator my colleague here at github

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,760
so excited for that discussion

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
um i first met swix at a conference

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
in the before times before the corona

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
almost two years ago

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,320
when he was giving a talk about state

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
machines for building clis

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
i knew of him in the context of his

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
famous

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,640
uh learning in public essay um

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
uh and the talk that he gave was a

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,720
fantastic demonstration of that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,680
diving into an area where he had

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
relatively

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,759
little expertise and making sense of

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
that territory and

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,520
jumping back out to explain it to the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,079
rest of us

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
after his talk he confessed to me that

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
he

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,040
he's actually a refugee from programming

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
excel for finance and i think

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
coming out of that background swix

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
excels at finding that place of empathy

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
for

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
developers in the middle of the

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
unglamorous the

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,720
the hard parts of development the parts

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
that we don't like to show off to one

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
another because

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
they don't make us look smart they don't

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
make us look look cool

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
his work normalizes the feeling of i'm

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
stupid right now which is

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
very much a part of every developer

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
journey and

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,160
with which i identify very very much um

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
i think that's what makes his thoughts

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
on community building

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,360
so relatable and so topical

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
um

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
developer facing businesses have to find

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,879
a way to channel

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
empathy into action and swix is figuring

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
that out

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,440
in all of its messiness in public for us

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,879
to see and learn from

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,640
um in fact the reason i reached out to

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,720
invite him onto the show is this recent

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
post that he he wrote called

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,400
technical community builders um and uh

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,080
looking critically at at how that's

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
different from the way devrel has done

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
today

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
and i think this is a very interesting

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
take on the future of of

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,840
of this business function for developer

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
facing businesses

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,519
um okay so before i bring him on

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
uh i'll remind everybody that we have a

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
code of conduct uh it's really important

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
to me that

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
chat is a place where everyone feels

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,319
welcome so um please make sure to

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
make that possible and without further

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,640

um fantastic um swix you said

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
that you uh wanted to give sort of uh a

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
little bit of uh

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
an upfront um sort of uh mini talk about

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,360
uh this before we dive into this

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,360
discussion um

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,639

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,280
us

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,800
i can't i can't actually see the screen

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
because i just have my

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
slides full screen so just pause me if

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,840
there's anything

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
i just wanted to i guess set some

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,360
context for people

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,720
who may not have read the post uh you

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
know i think you and i

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
and and dougie like we we've all sort of

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,040
talked about

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,639
uh community for a bit so we may have

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,440
more context than others

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,800
and so i just wanted to you know whip up

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
a few slides just to set some context

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
and then we can actually talk because

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,919
i'm very inspired by what github does

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
and

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,199
and i'm definitely learning a lot from

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,759
what um you know

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,440
uh you guys do for for community okay so

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
why invest in developer community a

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
little bit i feel like this is a bit

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
obvious but

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,800
but the reason i write like i would

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,720
normally never write something like this

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,120
because it just seems obvious

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
but the reason i write about it is i do

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
a lot of conversations with startups

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,039
and um sometimes for investing

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,880
sometimes just to give deveral advice um

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
sometimes you know

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,320
marketing or whatever other network

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,360
i can offer to startups i i often do

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
that um

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,639
but uh in in the past week or so like at

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
least

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,320
when i wrote that blog post in one week

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
i had three conversations that all ended

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
in

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
can you help us find somebody to build

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
developer community and i was like okay

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,919
this is

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
this is not just like one-off thing uh

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,080
this is a trend that

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,479
a lot of startup founders are feeling

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,320
and there's no one really kind of

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,400
dedicated to it there are people of

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,600
course but it's not like a

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
an industry trend yet so i decided to

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,039
write a blog post about that and that's

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
that's why i guess we're here today to

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,880
talk about what's going on

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
um why community is becoming more of a

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,639
thing it always has been a thing but

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
it's becoming more of a thing and maybe

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,479
professionalizing as well

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
um so a bit of context about me i think

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
iran already

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
introduced me quite a bit i did change

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
careers at age 30

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,160
but i definitely owe a lot of my career

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
change and learning to code and all that

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
to community right i joined the free

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,240
code cam community the coding blocks

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,520
slack group and podcast was also a very

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,919
big part of

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
companionship through the journey of

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,080
learning to code which is a very rough

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
one

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,280
even for me um and uh um

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and then of course i also did a boot

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
camp which is a

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
paid community but uh some one that's

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
very very focused on getting you hired

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
um

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
and that got me into two sigma nullify

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,360
aws and i work at temporal um

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
i think uh what i'm better known for

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,680
maybe

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
in the community space is is my

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
volunteer work in

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,000
this react subreddit where i helped to

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,199
grow uh the subreddit from 40 000

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,199
developers to over 220 000

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,440
before i stepped down um i stepped down

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,520
to uh basically because i

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
started moving my interest to another

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,479
front-end framework as felt

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
uh and i started that from zero uh to

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,160
now it's like

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,599
eight to nine thousand people um and i

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,000
also run a paid

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,800
community for learning in public so i

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,759
wrote a book

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,599
people like the book and then we ch chat

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
about career related stuff in in our

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,759
discord and in our circle community

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,599
um so that's my community credentials i

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,440
guess i should uh preface that

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,880
uh i guess i'm also i had to put this

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
here because uh github

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
at github universe did this uh really

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,960
cool

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
um octocat thing here so i just redid my

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
profile as a github

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,560
octocat which is really fun um and

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,039
i did i am was pretty honored to be

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,960
invited as a github star um which i

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,400
think is a way that github recognizes

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,919
community members as well which

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
we can also talk about like how do you

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,199
recognize and promote and

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
uh you know i guess you're you're super

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
fans and

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,599
and what does that really do for you um

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
okay so

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,879
uh i'll just i'll just blast through a

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
few points and then we can we can

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
set it up for whatever you guys want to

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
talk about

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,280
um so to me i i think the the main

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,280
articulation that i want to have is that

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,319
community is increasingly the moat of a

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
lot of developer

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
companies so developers have always

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
self-organized communities like irc and

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
bbs's

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
but now companies entire companies have

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,839
communities where that's their entire

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,760
mode like github is essentially git

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
uh plus a social network and it's real

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,919
like anyone can all forget you know but

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
it

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,959
it it's a it's a very it's very hard

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
proposition to replace a social network

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,000
and and you find that the same for stack

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
overflow there's a question and answer

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
side

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,680
anyone can build that but you cannot

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,920
build the community um and

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
say for hacker news so it seems like

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,200
it's very

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,640
you know a very key mode and you would

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
think that a lot more companies should

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,399
be

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,720
focused on that um but it doesn't seem

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,080
so at least in in terms of hiring when

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
you look at job titles and stuff like

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
that

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
they're more focused on like content

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
creation and marketing not so much

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
community and i think that's changing

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
right now

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
and that's why i write about it um so

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,440
that's the real question like whose job

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,279
is it anyway um

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,560
there are community managers but

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,120
typically

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
we had one in lfi um they are typically

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
focused on

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
grooming the forums um and social media

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,600
like maybe making

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,440
um inoffensive posts or whatever um

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
they they can do it they're capable of a

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,800
lot more these these are just sort of

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
stereotypical

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,880
uh tasks that are assigned to community

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,240
managers and then developer advocates

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
have a bit of community as well they do

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
a lot of content and outreach

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
to other communities so it's not so much

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,399
forming your own community rather than

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
um that's how do we reach out and and

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,560
present and be a part and meet

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,800
uh developers where they are rather than

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
uh draw people to us

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,480
which there is a lot of as well uh but

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,399
they they maybe don't have a as much of

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,440
a focus on sticking around and making

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,279
uh interrelationships customer success

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
is support documentation solutions

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,240
engineering all these are you know

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
community of people who pay you

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
uh and marketing mailing lists webinars

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
conferences these are all

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
you know isolated communities of people

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,800
who don't yet

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,079
pay you but could pay you and then i

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,760
think there's also you know

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
apart from function functional split

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,000
there's also sort of

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
org chart split and i do find that a lot

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
of people who are

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
sort of directly responsible for

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
community are

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,680
at the lower rungs of the of the org

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,160
chart rather than at the

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,079
at the upper rung so it's pretty weird

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,079
um that it's just splintered all over

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
the place it's not really organized

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,480
no it doesn't seem like sort of an

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,839
organizational priority in a lot of the

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,440
companies that i've seen um so the the

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,640
main realization for me is that

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
community is basically part of the

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
product and in fact in a lot of

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
companies it is the main part of the

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
products but it's under resource

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,200
comparative products

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,760
uh or engineering um

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
and i think something that is key is

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
like maybe we should not call it just

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,320
community management even though that's

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
a default title

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
so i i offered a few suggestions like

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,720
community developer or community tumblr

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,399
tumblr is a word from

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,040
i guess the circus um i i took it from

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,959
an alex hillman post blog post but

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
essentially a tumblr is someone who gets

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
conversations going in

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,920
and pieces out so a lot of times

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,839
community manager

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,360
does a lot of the the heavy lifting um

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
but you need to in order for a

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
functional community to to form into

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,720
something that has many-to-many

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,720
interactions instead of one-to-many

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,240
um you you need to get you need to have

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,440
someone to create events

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,640
where people feel safe and

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,079
and inspired and motivated to share and

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
to help each other out

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,680
um my preferred term right now is

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,360
technical community builder

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
because it's very similar to technical

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
product manager which is an actual job

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,079
title uh

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,600
at microsoft in amazon and a bunch of

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,560
other places

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,959
and it has an emphasis on technical and

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
the

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
and there's a question of like must they

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,079
be technical of course not

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,279
uh of course you can have very very good

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,000
community builders and community

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,240
managers

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
who are not technical at all but i think

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
people who are technical have this extra

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
dimension

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
which they can really empathize with

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,399
developers on

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,200
and connect people solve their solve

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
their problems right away

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,720
basically just you know be one of we one

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
of them like

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
when you when you talk to someone who

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
fundamentally empathizes with your

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
problems as a developer

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,279
you share more and you you have deeper

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
discussions

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
um and and then the other question is

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,279
why must the title be different

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,279
um i posit that it's very similar to to

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,279
the once in a lifetime upgrade in status

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,279
impact authority and career prospects

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,040
for ops professional when the devops

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,720
movement got started like devops

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,480
used to not be a thing now it's a very

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,839
highly in demand thing

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,079
and that's because it was a rebrand of

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,880
existing skills that were that that were

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,040
around but

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
you know repackaged with with new

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,839
technology and a new focus

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
in uh in a lot of organizations that

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,360
they

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
that they realize that they need to

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,519
invest in it um so i think a similar

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,680
movement needs to happen and you you

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
can't really rebrand something by

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
calling it the same exact

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
name so so that's why that's why there's

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,000
an opportunity to rebrand

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
uh this discipline here okay i'm very

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,959
influenced by

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
this model from comsort which is which

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,360
is essentially the opposite of what i

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,120
showed you earlier

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,959
where community used to be at the fringe

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
uh and you used to have all these

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,880
other other things sort of in control of

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,440
community

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
um and here and and the community-led

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
model kind of inverts that where

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,839
community is at the core of everything

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
um and from your insights from community

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,480
and

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,320
building relationships uh you you spin

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,399
out marketing you spin out products you

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,880
spin on sales and and so on and so forth

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
um and i think it's very interesting

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,120
migration

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
from periphery to core which i've

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
been told actually is the same thing

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,440
that's happening to data science data

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,199
science

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
at least in income in the companies that

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,480
i've worked with

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
used to be sort of a fringe thing where

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
like it's a bunch of

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
geeks you know uh messing around with

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,000
their

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,600
uh with their analytics to like now it

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,079
actually is part of the the reporting

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,680
process

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,519
that generates a lot of product and

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,360
sales and marketing insights

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,720
um and i think i think community can can

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
do that with humans

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
uh not not less less less data but you

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
can you can have a lot of data with it

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,839
as well

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
um so the question is why invest in it

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,519
and really i think

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,639
uh my my fundamental assertion is that

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,720
traditional marketing support

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,279
isn't cutting it um this is the

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,000
traditional idea of a marketing in sales

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,760
funnel you have

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,079
awareness evaluation and conversion and

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,240
we as developer relations people

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
definitely advise towards awareness for

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,320
better or worse

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
um but i think it is only one part of

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
the picture and it's very transactional

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,639
right

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,240
you start at the top um and then you you

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,760
come out at the bottom as a as a

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,040
salesperson and then and then you're

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,959
they're done with you

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
uh you i kind of wash my hands off you

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
and i and and you're handed out to

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,800
someone else

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,480
um the problems here are a few few fold

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,920
right like marketing

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
especially in developer marketing has

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
extremely long cycles

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,880
in traditional digital marketing you

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,720
need to touch uh

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,320
you know the the traditional advice is

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,760
that someone needs to hear about you six

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
to seven times before they even check

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,800
you out

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,399
for me i know a lot of technologies i

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
ignore them for a year

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,519
just to see if they stick around and if

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
they're still relevant after you then i

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,320
check them out

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
so try to do marketing attribution on

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,480
that impossible

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,839
um so very very difficult um and and not

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,399
within any

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,759
performance evaluation time frame and

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
then also what happens after i convert

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,920
right what happens after i come out the

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,160
funnel

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
do i feel supported there do i do i grow

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,600
and succeed and all that

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,600
um so the solution is to change from

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,079
mostly transactional finite games to

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,000
relationship based infinite games and

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,440
this is the bigger picture that i see

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,519
kind of there's marketing and sales

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,680
going on here but then

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,880
you it exists within a broader scope of

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,360
community that kind of

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
catches all the other stuff that isn't

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,680
really handled by marketing sales

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,560
we idan actually has loaded up the orbit

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
model which we can

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
i'm sure we're going to talk about so

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
instead of the funnel which is a very

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,519
linear approach

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,360
um the orbit model like kind of

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,360
is isn't or so it characterizes the

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,880
people around your company as

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,880
uh people orbiting your company and they

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,240
may be in wider orbits or they may be in

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
closer orbits

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
sometimes they may drop out sometimes

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,680
they may come back in it's a very

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,880
infinite relationship model where

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
they're just constantly orbiting and

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,040
you're just trying to draw them closer

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,519
with

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,399
uh more and more gravity towards your

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,759
your software

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,040
or your community um the reason i think

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
it's important for startups in

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
particular is that it's a very big part

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
of crossing the chasm

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,920
because there's a small set of people

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,160
who actually pick uh

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,240
technologies based on pure technical

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
merit and there's a large set of people

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,800
who

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,320
pick technologies partially on merit

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,680
partially because there's a strong

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,319
ecosystem

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,439
and there's a very very big steep gap in

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,480
between that

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,520
and people who can help companies cross

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,760
this gap

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
can deliver a lot of value for for the

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,959
companies involved

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
um and and that's a that's a really core

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
insight i think

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,640
okay there's even more reasons uh in my

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
blog post i don't have time to

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,240
go into all of these but uh we can talk

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,520
about them in a discussion i don't want

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
this to be a lecture

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,880
and i will refer and i have the last

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,280
part on why now

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,799
and i'll send people to the blog post if

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,080
they want to see it but that's my

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,559
short little primer for my thoughts on

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,559
community

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,320
fantastic um

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,520
that was a solid that was a solid uh

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
introduction

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,280
one one thing that really uh uh strikes

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
me about

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,080
uh what you're calling out here is that

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,080
i can't i can't highlight another area

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
where there's a business motion that's

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,960
so central to success

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,760
which is um which is so undefined like

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,799
you think about

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,520
most most functions in a business like

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,480
marketing or engineering or product and

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,360
if if i took

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,039
you know 10 random people and asked them

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
you know what does this job entail what

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
does success

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,320
look like and and how does it contribute

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,000
to the success of the overall business

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,240
and i'll get 10 answers that are more or

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
less the same

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
and here i think what's what's sort of

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,280
special and maybe

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,440
is um in in in a difficult sense

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,039
is that um uh i don't think that if i

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
ask 10 people like you know

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,160
what's the purpose of this business

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,200
function what does success

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,480
look like what does the job entail

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,039
um what level of talent do we need to

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,080
hire in order to accomplish this well

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,760
um even you know things as boring as

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,400
like you say sort of like you know

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
where on the totem pole like you know

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,360
who

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,039
who does who's responsible for this and

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,960
who do they report to

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
that level of of definition i don't

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,919
think i'm going to get 10 answers that

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
are mostly the same i think i'm going to

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,120
get 10

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,240
wildly different answers that um that

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
don't resemble one another

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,679
yeah if i could add two as well um this

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,679
is something that's come up

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
really recently for me because i shipped

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,120
a youtube video yesterday

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,799
um focused on like what the future of

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,960
devrel looks like so

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,240
think about community and how that sort

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
of changed even in

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,559
us being all remote um there's no real

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,840
like structure i think the um everything

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,720
everybody can kind of do something to

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
move the needle

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
but i think the folks are doing really

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,440
good jobs is when you look at that model

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
of the orbit

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
the folks as you bring more and more

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,919
people closer to nucleus

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,559
they stick around longer and i think one

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,840
thing that swix and i had in common

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,600
is that well a couple things we had in

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
common like i was part of that react sub

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,120
subreddit as well uh we also spent time

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,880
at netlify um

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
so like i've saw a lot of the same stuff

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,679
that swix has saw and what he's i

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,360
agree with everything that he said too

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,679
as well and the things that i think i

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
saw

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
successful at netflix that we had a

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
community of folks who were just really

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,240
excited about the product

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
and we found ways to bring them closer

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,520
to the the inner circle

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,200
to the point where there are identify

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
employees who now

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,200
who who came from that community so when

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
you think of like recruiting or not just

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
actually using the product but

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
if you're looking for your next advocate

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,720
it should come from the community that's

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
already existed

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,000
yeah i one of the points that i made was

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
that if hiring is your

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
biggest problem uh just like 99 of other

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
startups

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,919
or companies in general it doesn't have

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,080
to be startups um then building a strong

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,559
community helps you source very

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
much higher quality of employee than uh

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,200
you know just picking any random

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
developer off the street

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,400
uh i mean yeah like there's there's uh

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
in the post you you actually highlight

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,600
that there's this sort of a litany of

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
of uh of benefits and i don't remember

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
all of them off the top of my head but i

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
remember as i was reading through the

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
post

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,000
excuse me uh i thought that there was

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
um a lot more there than i expected you

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
know like i expected going into it just

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,799
like

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,640
well what benefits am i going to see

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,400
from from doing this well well

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
you know i'll do a better job at

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,080
outreach i'll do a better job

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,840
at uptake of my product um

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,360
but you know i hadn't thought of the

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,720
hiring angle even though that's

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,320
you know it's playing right there in

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
front of us you know if you build a

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,159
strong community you have

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,720
um um a very like high quality pool in

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,120
which to

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,559
to sort of fish for for for for

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,320
stand-out employees

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,480
um that it's a source of of um

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,400
not exactly free marketing but you know

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
it's like you have a chance of growing a

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,720
class of evangelist people that are

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,720
going to go out

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
and spread the word about about what

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,520
whatever it is that you're doing

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,840
um i i've even sorry

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
i've even gone one step further so i

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
took the hiring

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
thing to the extreme so the com the

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
startup that i work at right now

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,360
temporal uh we actually started listing

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,159
jobs for our customers

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,679
so that we can help them hire based on

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,480
based on uh through us

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
um so so like okay if you don't work for

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
us but

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,559
just come work at one of the con want to

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,919
come to one of our customer companies

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,280
um and it's just like a it like we win

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,080
if they win you know what i mean

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,039
and and it's you can just take this to

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,280
an extreme level

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,480
where you just start becoming a de facto

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,520
recruiting agency

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
um if you're really good

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
but i do i do think that like you know

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
if you do a really good job of community

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,280
actually

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,039
you're the the person's membership in

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,240
your community actually outlives

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,760
their uh present employer um and that

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,000
that's a really strong community

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,520
that's like okay i'm i'm first and

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
foremost a member of your developer

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
community

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,440
then secondarily i just happen to be at

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,080
this company right now

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,760
um but you know i do i do have my

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,120
primary network within within your

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
community that's a really strong one

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,159
it and i guess could i add uh actually

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,320
get some clarification too from you swix

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,280
uh when you talk about these um terms

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,440
like devops

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,360
who like everybody knows what devops is

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,640
now it wasn't an unknown thing you know

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
ten plus years ago

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,120
um but when you build a community

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
like what are some sort of like ways you

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,840
can avoid those pitfalls because i know

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,799
every time i go to an event and i join a

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
random slack

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,159
channel for just that event like i leave

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,200
that slack channel as

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,159
soon as it's done so like i'm curious

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,799
what your

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,480
your thoughts are um as far as building

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,840
community from scratch

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,679
wait are you saying that this is a

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,520
problem with devops or are you just i'm

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,640
sorry i use devops because devops is a

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,919
very clear term there's already

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
established community

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,799
but if i started b doug e conference

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,679
everybody join the movement like it's

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,520
going to be a challenge

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,039
because it's going to be me and maybe a

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
couple people in chat

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,559
uh so like how do i make sure that this

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,640
is not another community that's

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
become stagnant or stale like i want to

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,799
create the next device i got you

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,360
i got you i got you yeah um i think so

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,360
you and i

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,960
of course we're very informed by an lfi

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
experience uh for anyone who doesn't

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
know

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,520
uh uh vidagi actually started the whole

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,480
death row practice

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,320
at nullify and i basically you know was

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,919
one fourth of his job

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,960
after he left um anyway uh

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,400
and something that nullified then which

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,919
was brilliant was that they didn't

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,480
create the nullify movement they didn't

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,919
create the

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
the netify conference they create the

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,360
jam stack movement uh in the jazz

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,440
conference and and i really i like this

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,440
idea that you build something that's

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,919
bigger than yourself like you build

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
a movement that other people can evol

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,840
get involved with

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,200
and see themselves in to the point where

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
they start competing with you and you

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
have to be okay with it

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,320
if you're so mission driven that you're

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,159
okay losing

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,080
because someone did your job better than

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
you then you

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,840
then you've really found something

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,840
that's worth building a community around

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
because otherwise it's just you're

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,640
building a cult i guess

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,080
where it's standard around you um and

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,440
and so i i really like

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,840
that for example i'll give you a

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,720
concrete example which is at i think our

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,880
second

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,559
jam stack confident nullify we invited

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,760
people from microsoft

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,520
competitor in in some ways who did not

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
use nullify at all did not pitch nullify

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,400
at all

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,640
but just presented their ideas on jab

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,400
stack and we invited them as a speaker

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,039
um and had yeah i mean i i i think

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,880
that we should have more and you know uh

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,200
competitive competitor companies also

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
visited the conference as well i think

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,080
we should have more of that i think it

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,159
shows a fundamental

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,679
level of security that you're like okay

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
i'm not threatened by you or

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,960
like i care about this enough that um

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,880
you know there this is

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,799
big enough that multiple players can win

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
in this space that's

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,320
a real community whereas um you know a

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,440
lot of other

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,480
times you're just kind of running it to

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,039
um as a feeder service into into into

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
your marketing funnel

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,080
yeah i like the the thought about

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,039
building a community that's bigger than

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
yourself

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,640
um and i think like speaking from

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,000
github's perspective because i was a

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,279
long time user

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
recently employed at github in the last

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,960
three years not really that reason but

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,400
in startup worlds that's that's kind of

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,480
that's like forever ago

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
um but what i'm getting at is like the

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,799
whole

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,799
git collaboration open source protocol

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,000
like i don't i like that github didn't

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,080
sort of try to strangle it

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,840
and try to own it completely there are

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,559
other competitors are doing a great job

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,120
in having collaboration tools around get

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,320
up get

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,039
uh just get in general and

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,159
that sort of funnel of new users

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,120
community

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,720
conferences slack rooms discords uh it's

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,760
been helpful for me in doing my job

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,440
because there's already established

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,360
community that i can just

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
go in and not try to take leadership on

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,000
but more of like hey i want to learn

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,919
from you as well

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
yeah totally totally i i do think that

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,919
at some level there's

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,200
there's a transition from like okay this

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,039
is bigger than yourself but then

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
at some point you're you're big enough

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,480
that you are a community on your own

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,159
um and i think you know once you're past

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
like 50 million

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,200
developers you can have your own

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,640
community that's totally fine

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,799
same thing for like salesforce and

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
dreamforce and aws and re invents like

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,679
we all

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,039
you know huge companies have their own

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,480
conferences and that's totally fine

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,919
but i think when you're getting things

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
off the ground it's a totally different

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,320
story

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,799
yeah um

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,600
i think i think you you you touched on

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,440
something

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,960
interesting there about um picking

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
you know it's always it's always hard to

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,880
sort of stay away from

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,840
um like blatant advertising when it

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
comes to

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,600
like developers like you know who do i

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,880
work for what is it that they make

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
that's obviously going to be a central

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,520
part of the discussion if you know i'm

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,960
representing

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,399
you know company x or y um

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,399
but you highlighted that you know for

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,760
netlify the story was not

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:06,880
um it was not nfi it was

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,480
jam stack for github it wasn't

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,559
um uh look at um github and

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,679
and uh and our specific web app but

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,399
the um the collaborative nature

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,559
of open source specifically powered by

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,080
decentralized version control

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,880
um and like you know the git

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,559
uh is important um the pull requests are

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,880
important the rest of the stuff that

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,960
gita brings is important but it's not

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
um that's not the thing that's going to

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,200
emotionally resonate with

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,799
with people on its own not unless you

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
have such a

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,760
you know so much of a better product

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
that it's like oh my god people are

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
wowed by just the existence of this

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
thing

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,080
um which is great if you can pull that

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,520
off like more power to you you know

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,360
um uh i think

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,000
you you touched on this sort of linear

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,240
path okay

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
like you have a story you tell it um and

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
you think about this

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,960
this path that that you want to take

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
people a journal

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
journey that you want to take people

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,080
along um that starts in sort of

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,480
marketing territory and ends in sales

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,960
territory hopefully um

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,080
uh and then by contrast you know coming

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,880
back to the

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,080
to the orbit model um one of the sort of

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
assertions you made there is that

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,360
the urban model is not it's not strictly

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,120
linear that it has these other

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,640
dimensions it has this love dimension

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,679
basically like a measure of

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,240
of activity um and reach as a

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,440
as a as a measure of influence but when

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
i still look at this

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,120
uh this model it's still talking about

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,039
these sort of concentric rings of

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,039
you know you start at the very outermost

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,279
orbit you know as just an observer and

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,480
ostensibly you move move your way into

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,039
the middle that still

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,320
seems like a relatively you know linear

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,760
journey to me

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,720
um uh i think it's curious i you know

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,120
that they that they put advocates at as

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,159
the the closest the innermost ring

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,840
um uh versus contributors

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,840
because when i think about sort of like

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,200
where where do i spend

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,440
the maximum amount of energy um it's in

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,799
contributing it's not an obvious it's

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,080
really easy for me to advocate i can

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,559
advocate

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,159
react until the the cows come home and

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,840
you know all i got to do is write like

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
nice things about react but contributing

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,520
to react

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,559
that's already like a an effortful

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,200
activity

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,279
um so i'm i'm curious sort of uh you

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,279
know

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,880
about that that journey like what do you

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,360
think

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,120
is it is it really about getting people

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,600
to contribution is contribution just

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,679
sort of

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,360
like a left turn on this does this make

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,240
sense to you i don't know i'm curious

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,240
what you think about this

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,880
ah i feel like they've probably written

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,919
this up so i'm actually looking up the

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,440
the

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
the writer right now because this is

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
probably a better question for uh

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,600
patrick woods who came over this model

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,039
uh but i agree with you on principle at

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
least in the open source context

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,720
uh the people who number people who

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,080
contribute are far less

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
than the number of people who advocate

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,840
for a thing and uh maybe that that

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,679
should be the inner circle

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,360
um i would say that it's less linear

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,080
because the the whole point is that you

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,360
can

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,279
jump in and out of different orbits um

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,399
depending on your life situation or just

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,600
whatever project you're working on

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,640
that's totally fine

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,840
it's not considered a failure um

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,000
yeah i don't know if dougie has any

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,240
other yeah i do have some thoughts

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,519
because i i know patrick and i know josh

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,679
uh pretty well

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,600
and uh i have been able to rub shoulders

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,080
with them so the founders of the orbit

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,039
model

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
are the orbit commun uh company as well

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,159
and um

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,279
i talked to patrick on his podcast which

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,519
is called developer love

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,279
in episode one you can hear way more

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,600
detail what what i go into

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,440
and right now but the one thing that i

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,840
had to figure out when i joined github

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
as a developer advocate and at the time

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
we had advocates but no one actually had

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,360
the title

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,120
at the time at github so i was given

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,880
the reins to do developer relations at

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,200
get up figure out what that meant

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,159
and um at that time i had to sort of

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
figure out

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
also what that meant but also give a

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,000
talk at developer devrelcon because we

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
had a

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,760
speaking slot and i i call myself the

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,360
beyonce of github

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,240
and i do that tongue-in-cheek and i joke

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,200
around about that but i do that because

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,960
like i don't play i don't play beyonce's

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,919
music all day every day like i don't

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
you know i don't know how to play the

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,080
backing tracks on bass or anything like

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,919
that

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,600
so i'm not really contributing in that

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,799
sense but i will tell you about beyonce

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,919
and tell you her story

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,000
uh and i think it's the same thing of

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,960
open source like i made a contribution

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,120
to node.js

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
back in november it was a really painful

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,840
process i learned a ton

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,679
and my contribution to node.js was that

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,960
i write blog posts i did a contribution

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
on the repo

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,600
but the difference is when i get on

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,600
stage and i show you how to write a

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,159
script in node and i go around and i

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,200
share

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,000
i'm like why note is still great despite

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,120
deno or dino and all these sort of rus

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
compiler times

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,240
like i'm still advocating for node.js

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,200
and i think

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,240
if you can bring more people to the sort

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,080
of inner circle

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,000
um i think that's that's always going to

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
be super helpful and if you have people

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,880
who are going to be

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
the mouthpiece i guess what i'm getting

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,080
at is my job at github

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,320
is not to be the number one developer

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,000
advocate in the world my job is to build

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,240
more developer advocates

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,039
so if you can advocate get on github on

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,480
behalf

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
of github and i don't have to be

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,039
involved then that's an

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,080
entire automation automated process now

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,760
you can argue

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,200
contributions i can automate that and

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,720
it's going to grow and sustain

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
the project but there are a lot of

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,760
github projects or sorry open source

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
projects have lots of contributions that

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,960
you've never heard of

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,039
um so like until someone tells me that

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
exists or i see it on the trending tab

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,080
uh it's going to be a hard sort of a

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,840
hard

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,279
thing to focus on to try to get more

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,159
contributors when no one's actually

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,159
knows about this project

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,120
right there's there's definitely i mean

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,960
that's definitely like a like a hurdle

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,000
um um to be crossed in terms of just

00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
like you know

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,039
um where do i even hear about this i

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,679
mean obviously there's

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,279
there's you can think of that as i'm

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,919
sure not coming from a marketing

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,919
background

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,000
you know i'm sure those entire textbooks

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,320
about sort of the phase of like you know

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
how do i get people to even know that i

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,000
exist before

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,839
i like you know how do i i wedge the

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
door open long enough for me to attempt

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,599
to get across like

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,960
and here's why you should care about me

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,919
um

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,280
there's a whole phase of of of just

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,839
spreading the word

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,480
um that's why that's why i think you

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,359
know

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,119
we i do i do think that we do need

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,520
technical community builders whatever

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,800
the

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
you know whatever you call this thing

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,679
they they probably need to be technical

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
because they need to have that technical

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,320
leadership

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
of like i authentically went through the

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,079
same journey that i'm telling you

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,599
that i'm you know hoping that you also

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,520
go through with me on this

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,040
um and and this is something that

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,520
non-technical community managers cannot

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,399
do

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
so it's like a weird thing where uh you

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,280
have to hire

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,879
someone on a who like has a software

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,599
engineering background or like is it you

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,359
know

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,200
pay them like a developer but then put

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,960
them on non-technical things which is

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,480
community is less technical right you

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,520
know i i don't know

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,560
it's a weird job it's just there's like

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,440
the authenticity

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,640
to it too as well like i would not know

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,000
how to be a developer advocate if i

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
wasn't a developer first

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,119
so like i always put myself in the

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,760
mindset of like if i had to use this

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
thing

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
and it takes me 12 minutes to get it set

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,040
up like i'm probably never going to use

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,640
it again so like how can i advocate on

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,880
the behalf of this product

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
to make this better and how can i bring

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,119
that information back

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,760
to whoever makes decisions at this

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,320
project

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,760
company maintainer level or whatnot and

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
um it's just like i i just

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,800
still think it's one step more than just

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,960
contributing

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,640
keeping the lights on uh it's more like

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,119
hey i want to also bring that feedback

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,599
how can i improve this and i think

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,480
the the roles inside the community i

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
think technical

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,160
community manager it's a great role

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,599
because it actually touches

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,960
all those different pillars and

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,480
specifically in the overpowered model i

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,800
know we're focused on that but

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,520
like being able to you know turn it on

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,720
turn it off

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,480
and also know how to listen as well um

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,160
are very valuable uh like

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,640
attributes that i would love to have on

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,079
my team at github for sure

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,119
and we do have those by the way i just

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,119
just want to set the record

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
just to be just to be up front and clear

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,520
so um i think

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
i think we're all dancing around a

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,640
little bit sort of um

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,320
the the the bigger question of

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,040
um uh what are the qualities like what

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,119
are

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240
what does success look like for this

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,800
role how does it

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,240
how has it changed like you know if we

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,599
if we called the role previously

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
developer relations and now we're

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,480
calling

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,760
it um uh this subtly different

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,320
name around um technical community

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,119
building

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,440
and sort of the the the stewardship and

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,560
the shepherding of a community

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,119
um what um

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,880
what's success how is success different

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,800
in in this sort of like uh

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,079
slightly different like mental model and

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,079
and what's different

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
in the day-to-day like you know if if

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
previously

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,119
you know previously i was doing devrel

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
and that meant i was doing

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,119
x y and z with my days in order to

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,240
succeed at my job

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,160
um and contribute to the success of the

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,200
business

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,160
what does that look like in this sort of

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,880
new mental framing of community building

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,800
as opposed to

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,200
simply developer relations

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,400
yeah um so i can give a crack at it and

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,359
then i'm sure dougie has

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,480
other thoughts um you know at amazon i

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,200
can tell you directly

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,240
the the kpis that we were reporting and

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,839
were sort of

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,680
to the outside world that's that's the

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,359
only thing that they expect out of us

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,599
which is number of views on the content

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,359
that we produce right

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,359
very depersonalized you're just a number

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,480
to me um did i get a thousand did i get

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,200
ten thousand did i get a hundred

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,200
thousand

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
um i did a better job it was a bigger

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,119
number great

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,320
uh but there's no relationship there

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,119
there's no

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,560
measurement of quality like was was did

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,599
they just like glance at the title or

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
did they actually read the whole thing

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,720
and try out the demo

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,240
um there are different weights for

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,400
different um

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,400
you know actions that people can take

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
and and we do try to track that

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,160
but it's all a joke like it's no

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,680
everyone knows that it's kind of a joke

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,440
um you know it's a proxy to what we

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,560
really want which is people trying you

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,680
out and

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
seeing if they like you um and you know

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,599
short of

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,079
standing over their shoulders you can't

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,040
really get that

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,119
so so i think what i what i do what i do

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,680
like is that orbit is trying to

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,200
innovate on that by measuring uh you

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
know what they call love which is just

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,960
the intensity of activity

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,680
um which is kind of the the same thing

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,720
but tracked on a per person basis

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,400
um and and and so just

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
in and that opens up the possibility of

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,680
like uh having more of like a crm model

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,400
which is very much

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,200
the sales idea of like um you know have

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,720
have an idea of

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
the customer journey from beginning to

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,760
end and uh

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,079
suggest or automate engagements um as

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,240
they as they come along on the journey

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
um which which is less it's just a lot

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,800
less transactional like and

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,079
even at nullify um like i was

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,800
when you get to the point of like

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,320
attaching utm tags to your post

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,240
to see the the response of of

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,160
your campaigns um that's just you're

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,000
just marketing you're not their bro

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,520
um i mean uh and so so i i definitely

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,200
care a lot more about the relationship

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,599
aspect and how much you can

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,880
you can cultivate just by um

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,599
understanding the customer journey

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,440
rather than

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,160
treating them as uh sort of faceless

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,160
uh numbers

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,800
yeah to add to that too as well like i

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,599
i'm all i'm definitely against trying to

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
look at views

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
and uh how many people are in the stream

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,200
right now because i think that's

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,119
you you've sort of lost it at that point

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,640
but i think what success looks like

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,400
is the names that i see in this chat

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,760
right now i see a lot of familiar names

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,040
so how many of those familiar names so i

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,960
see next time

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,640
because those are my and i don't even

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,400
know this term tumblers

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,520
that you mentioned in your slides um

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,319
because i've seen this around but i

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,400
didn't know what that was

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,440
the party corgi chat has tumblers and i

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
didn't know what tumblrs were

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,000
until today um but i guess i have an

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,440
anecdote too as well from

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,839
netlify um when i was there and uh we

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,359
we were sort of bottom growing and we

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,680
had this opportunity to speak uh

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,880
speak and also attend and have a booth

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,319
at react rally

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,240
and it would have been super easy to say

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,240
hey can you fill out this form

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,520
and we'll send you we'll get your email

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
and then you have a chance to win

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,160
you know this thing at netlify um and

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,119
instead my approach at that conference

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,119
which was like one of the first

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,599
conferences i ever had any sort of

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,880
marketing advertising whatever uh my

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,560
approach was

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,560
come to the booth uh we had a nintendo

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,400
switch on the on the booth table

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,160
and then we had a bunch of stickers and

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,160
the thing was if you

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,680
switch to nullify which is like it was a

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,200
pun really um

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,040
and then we'll give you a chance to win

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,119
the switch and the step was

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
all you had to do is scan a qr code and

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,480
then click the deploy to notify button

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,880
that was on that that website

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
uh or sorry it was a github repo you put

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,160
click the deploy notify button

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,319
and then inside the site you deployed

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,800
from netlify after 15 to 30 seconds it

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,240
took

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,160
i happened to be a gapsby site so we

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,079
were like on brand for the conference

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,480
uh then you read the website you just

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,079
deployed and the instruction says

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
click this button to tweet and if you

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,040
tweet that would actually put you in a

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,640
hashtag and i had a node server that

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,040
would then pick a random person

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,240
so we did this for three days um we gave

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,280
away the switch by the second day

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,200
because we had enough people

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,200
i think the conference was like 600 700

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,240
and we had about 325

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,240
people who participated um and then

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,760
after the first day we knew we engaged a

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,000
community because the next day

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,520
two or three people came and said hey uh

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,119
i clicked the button and then i saw what

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,000
you deployed and it was a gatsby site

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,000
and at the time

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,599
gatsby wasn't even 1.0 so like nobody

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,960
would use gatsby at that time

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,640
and uh they're like yeah i switched my

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,200
entire blog to gatsby uh

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,680
and it's hosted on lfi so then we know

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,200
hey this person's actually super engaged

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,560
this is this is my next advocate like

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
i'm gonna whatever you need i'll give

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
you

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,640
a sweater t-shirt even if you don't win

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,079
the switch like i will engage you

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,400
and give you everything you need to

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,240
continue down this path

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,760
and uh that was the focus and like for

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,359
marketing it looked great

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,359
uh but we didn't have the sort of

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,119
traditional fill out this web form

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,119
it was this click this button use the

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,319
product if you don't want it or if you

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,880
want to delete the repo

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,520
by all means github at the time github

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
had all

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,560
your information like we weren't even

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,240
collecting your information um

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,319
so like the goal is just really just try

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,640
it take it for a test drive

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,319
and then if it works out for you uh we

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,880
have this forum we have this community

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,280
we have

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,040
github issues like this jump in where

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,160
you fit in

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,240
yeah and then we also i think potential

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,200
uh enterprise team customers this was

00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,240
after brian left

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,599
but um you know uh we also had like a

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,200
separate process for

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,720
potential customers to highlight to the

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,040
sales team where we actually

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,920
scanned their badges and took down info

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,240
and basically

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
fed in directly to their crms or

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
whatever

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,880
and that was pretty good because like we

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,319
were able to capture a lot of uh really

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,760
useful detail that

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,440
gave our sales people a really good head

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,280
start

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,560
yeah and you just don't know who you're

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
who you're chatting with to as well

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,319
because that that story i just shared

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,599
about being out react rally uh one of

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,800
the people who walked up and said hey

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,280
this is actually pretty cool

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,560
um that person was max toy burr and max

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,839
story berg

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,280
a lot of a lot of people know him he

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,800
used to actually work github for time he

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,440
built a whole product got acquired by

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,880
github

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,520
and now he's at gatsby as well

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,440
coincidentally um but i never met max i

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,920
just knew who he was i knew of the story

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,359
uh and then we connected and like he

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,040
didn't like he wasn't like the number

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,079
one netflix fanboy i'm pretty sure he

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,680
didn't walk away

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,280
shipping everything to netlify but we

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,520
made that connection so

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,800
every time i had a conversation with max

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,319
or he remembered me

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,920
that was like a nice serendipitous

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,680
moment of like oh yeah we met at that

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,520
one time that when i did that thing

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,880
and like you just can't put a metric to

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,560
that of like

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,000
what big names do you know that well

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,040
like at the time max was like he wasn't

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
even a big name

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,400
but like you just yeah you can't

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,800
quantify that you can't put a number to

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,960
that

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,400
you just kind of have to go with it i

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,000
mean it probably contributed to

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,640
the react to docs being on nullify as

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,400
well yeah probably

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,000
yeah it's so it's a domino effect and

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,119
there's also like a density effect

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,640
like one person using it all right cool

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,400
two people all right cool but then like

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,359
three prominent people then it starts to

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,520
become a thing

00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,040
you know um so i like that concentration

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,319
of like uh

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,480
presence uh which which also points to

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,720
it being more of a community right so

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,880
um yeah i i don't think i don't think we

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,640
gave it on like a lot of like numbers

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,640
we're just like we just talk about

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,319
people is it's a very natural thing

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,000
yeah and the one thing i did want to add

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,960
too real quick is that the one thing

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,920
when i joined github

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,680
my biggest goal was i spent four years

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,200
in san francisco and i only needed like

00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,119
a handful of github employees

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,640
never i went to the github office and my

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,319
goal as a get up employee today and a

00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,440
developer advocate is i want to put

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,040
via face to a company that has an octa

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
cad for a face like i want you to know

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,920
who to reach out to

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,359
and if it's me or if it's not me like

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,720
i'll give you the right person

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,040
uh and that's like one of my goals at

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,440
github um to do to be an advocate

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,520
for getting you the right router you're

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,359
the writer

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,640
that's that's interesting i mean like

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,000
you know there's a part of

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,599
of my brain in the background it's like

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,119
you know like the true win was the

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,000
friends we made along the way

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,920
um uh that's the subtitle of the blog

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,640
post

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,599
exactly um it turns out that um uh

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,160
uh um it's interesting though that

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,920
because the

00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,520
the this role that you you just

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,720
described this thing exists it's called

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,359
an ombudsman

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,640
and um uh if you're sort of familiar

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,400
this i think it comes out of the

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,319
military like you know this is

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,480
like the person that the families at

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,960
home are in touch with in order to like

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
you know

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,040
reach their their loved ones that are

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,160
deployed wherever and have any concerns

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,200
or whatever and so that

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,680
there's a there's a sort of like a name

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,079
for

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,079
for for this role of like you know

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,400
liaison into the company an

00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,079
actual human that can you know step in

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,480
and maybe not

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,280
help you solve your problem directly but

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,880
at least

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,400
point you in the right direction like

00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,839
you know attach you to the person that

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,040
can actually help you

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,040
uh move forward um but you're

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
you're right in saying that there's like

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,640
you know these aren't

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,240
you haven't really given me like hard

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,560
metrics um

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,000
like you know if i'm now going to pitch

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,680
to a company like hey

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
here's what i'm going to do for you

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,680
they're going to be like okay like you

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,480
know

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,680
what are what are the what are the okrs

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,720
what are the kpis what

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,040
what is the thing that you're going to

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,440
be measured on how do we know

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,880
that if what we're doing is succeeding

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,000
there is a company that actually

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,240
does that which is um weaver.ai

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,319
they call it community qualified leads

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,079
and they take a very salesy model to to

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,839
this like

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,200
direct attribution towards sales and

00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,200
marketing and all that

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,720
um and so yeah i mean once you have the

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,000
tracking system in place you can def you

00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,560
can absolutely do that and if you need

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,920
to

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,400
quantify in that way then absolutely um

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,560
yeah you know i i i don't necessarily

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,319
feel that strongly because

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,640
um it tends to be then become a fight

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,640
for

00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,920
whoever is the last touch who gets the

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,559
most attribution

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,680
um which makes it a very political thing

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,760
sometimes between

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,040
departments and sometimes that sounds

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,440
like it's going to set up all the wrong

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,800
incentives

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,319
it's like when you're like you know at a

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,839
store and you get mobbed by like you

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,800
know i was like no i'm the one who like

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,520
you know did anybody help you today well

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,720
um yeah it's like uh so for me i don't

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,240
know if you guys have played kerbal

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,920
space program

00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,200
no only only only heard of it

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,520
okay i'll just give you like the rough

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,240
intuition uh when you when you start off

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,559
trying to uh get the rocket from off the

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,079
ground into into orbit uh you're very

00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,040
concerned with all the tiny little

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,200
mechanics of like

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,520
what degree tilt you're doing what um

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,920
what your yaw is and pitch and whatever

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,440
um and your velocity and your weight and

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,079
and the stages that you do

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,119
uh but once you're basically kind of at

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,160
velocity and

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,680
in space you then only care about uh

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:17,200
your like dv um well i forget what uh

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,200
the the the calculus is

00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,240
but like you only care about your high

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,599
level metrics

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,440
and you don't actually care about the

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
low level stuff because you're you're

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,680
you're beyond that you're kind of

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,440
cruising at a speed where um you you

00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,119
should just

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,640
move the big controls that actually

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,200
matter and then and leave the

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,800
leave the minor attributions uh to to

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,079
like random noise or like it's going to

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,119
bubble up if it actually becomes a

00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,000
problem

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,119
um and i i think that that's how large

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,760
enough communities should be managed

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,640
like

00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,400
um as long as as long as your efforts

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,319
are growing at a decent rate you can

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
trust that it probably will trickle down

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,280
to

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,240
whatever you don't really have to be too

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,559
precise about

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,599
how exactly you attribute it that's at

00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,440
least my intuition

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,800
um it's gonna it's gonna bother me now

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,359
that i don't remember what the it's like

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,440
dvd or

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,640
something like that your delta yeah

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,480
delta v or

00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,760
yeah anyway i'm sure someone in the chat

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,559
is yelling at me

00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,359
um i have a question for you guys uh if

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,440
if you want to

00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:16,720
entertain this so there's a there's a

00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,760
problem in my mind which i haven't

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,480
resolved which is

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,960
this idea of a super user um so at net

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,440
lift

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,599
netlife we call them network friends uh

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,680
at github you call them github stars

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,559
uh stripe has drive community experts

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,720
these are an aws aws community builders

00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,920
these are basically unpaid uh super

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,280
users which you

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,559
give some kind of you know perks

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,480
uh but they're kind of your external

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,240
third party advocates

00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,640
uh what do you think about them how do

00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,640
you make them effective um

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,079
and and basically everyone is new to

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,240
this game like github

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,119
stars program is like a few months old

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,079
um right

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,440
or maybe a year old yeah since september

00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,119
what's your what's your what's your take

00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,480
on on these kinds of programs like what

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,960
what is what are

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,040
what's their role uh compared to you

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,079
guys

00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,880
yeah i could speak on partially behalf

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,880
of github

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,000
uh and something that i've always also

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,359
put a lot of thought into before

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,200
i got i could help because i was trying

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,920
to it's ironic because i was trying to

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,480
help build

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,359
what was now in the network friends um

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,040
and uh

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,839
but i i just didn't have time before i

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,160
left to actually see that do

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,960
what it is today uh but i had that same

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,559
thought of like

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,559
what it's kind of the reason i gave that

00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,280
talk on uh so being the beyonce of

00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,760
github

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,200
is because beyonce has a super fan group

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,680
uh and they're called the beehive

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,040
yeah yeah they're as intense of if you

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,440
go after beyonce

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,800
the bee high will show up and um and

00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,480
it's not not as that intense but it's

00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,960
like when people came after her after

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,839
she had

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,040
the baby like people you know snow had a

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,319
really great skit where

00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,079
there was like someone who admitted that

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,280
they didn't they didn't like beyonce's

00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,280
song and then they just the beehive

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,720
showed up

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,640
yeah and it's the same that we saw with

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,920
the um the uh

00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,480
k-pop stands like bts

00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,319
that's a little like more extreme but

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,720
like there's a group that will go to bat

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,480
for you

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,920
and like my job is to really go to go to

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,319
bat for the hive so

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,040
to answer your question like success

00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,960
looks like

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,040
these are the folks that are creating

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,720
the courses writing the books they're

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,480
they're on the forefronts of creating

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,480
the youtube videos when

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,000
the thing is announced like it's the

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,280
opportunity to give them as much

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,640
information as they want so if they want

00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,000
to monetize that they can

00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,680
if they want to grow community around it

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,839
they can uh but it's

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,880
simply like they're doing a good job uh

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,920
and we want to make sure that we're

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,319
catering to them

00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,280
uh because you don't if if someone's

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,480
already doing

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,240
like my job for me like i'm all for hey

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
let's let's have a coffee let's let's

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,640
learn

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,400
what are your blockers how can i unblock

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,920
you uh in the future or

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,920
are there any features you're looking to

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,800
like to ship like let me introduce you

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,040
to pm

00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
and let me let the pm get your feedback

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,720
directly so like you

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,240
just take the company directly to the

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,559
source of the the growth

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,839
and uh that's that's what i see it as

00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,599
and um i've seen

00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,599
very i've had similar talks to other

00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,119
leaders of these sort of groups

00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,680
and that's usually what their goal is is

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,359
like this help empower folks uh through

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,640
the people who are empowering their

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:18,160
product yeah

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,040
yeah i like that i

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,720
uh i'm like strongly reminded of um

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,240
there's a post from

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,440
way back in the the dinosaur ages um um

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,720
uh about success being a function of of

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,400
being able to grow

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,400
a thousand uh superfans um

00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,760
and that if you can find a way to to

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,040
reach that sort of threshold and it's

00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,920
thrown out there i think in the same

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,240
sense as

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,040
um i don't remember uh who coined the

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,200
like you know

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,640
mastery comes at ten thousand hours or

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,400
something like that is sort of like a

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,319
order of magnitude like when you reach

00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,520
this uh um

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:55,040
uh this this tipping point then that's

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,960
that's a signal that like you know what

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,960
you're doing is working and maybe

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,079
maybe this is the the kind of metric

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,440
that um

00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,960
that we're looking at it's not views

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,760
it's not posts it's like you know how

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,800
many

00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,960
how many engaged super fans are are we

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,960
creating how many people do we have

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,640
that love the thing that we're doing so

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,599
much that they're going out of their way

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:20,319
to spread that to more people and

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,480
looking at that is sort of

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,839
the uh like you say about the kerbal

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,800
space program sort of like you know the

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,119
gross levers

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,280
of of success not the little like

00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,880
fine-tuning adjustment dials but like

00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,480
you know the big steering wheel

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,640
that indicates that like we're doing the

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,760
right thing um

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,880
um i don't know i mean the this

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,280
this question of like you know what has

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,760
been the impact of of github stars

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,800
um this has only existed i guess now

00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,200
since uh

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:51,839
uh uh w since september september yeah

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,760
so if this is like a hot minute old um

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,720
or maybe it's like a thousand years old

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,319
it's unclear yeah and actually i i think

00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,680
the official launch was september we

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,720
actually started formating this

00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,680
uh form uh i guess making the formation

00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,240
of the stars

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,359
uh around may uh june and i get to have

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,079
like a very clear

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,599
impact that we i saw uh from my end uh

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,119
which we we watched this feature called

00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,559
the github profile readme

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,800
uh it's a feature everybody has access

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,720
to but at the time we had this sort of

00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,720
under wraps and like a super alpha and

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,520
we do for all features at github we have

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,440
the staff ship

00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,680
that we call it which is like alpha

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,440
alpha or whatever comes before alpha but

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,200
um that's what we we how we test our

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,240
features so get up employees all

00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,760
leveraged it and

00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,920
it sort of like came out of nowhere as

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,240
far as this feature goes and

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,079
with might have access to it we were

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,119
able to get this in front of stars

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,480
um pretty early on to the point where uh

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,240
we actually had to get upstar who

00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,599
created some content on how to build

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,040
your your profile readme

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,440
it was like pretty cool like within a

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,000
week of launch and um

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,760
that basically is the de facto tutorial

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
on how to create a profile readme

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,359
uh because it was so early this came out

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,760
and um

00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,680
uh this individual monika which i guess

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,720
i can i can name them as well

00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,720
they are now like they're they're

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,319
seo wise like that's the post like it's

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,240
not the docs.github.com

00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,599
and like that's success to me that's

00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,839
like seeing someone

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,839
when in the source in the sense of

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,359
content and engagement of the community

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,200
and now as a point person when it comes

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,040
to that feature

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,319
that's that's actually really a really

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,680
great it's like you know i know that

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,640
i've succeeded at this job

00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:28,160
when when other people's like you know

00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,920
results outrank mine on

00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,640
on on google then success um

00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,520
um that's fantastic uh we actually have

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,720
a question me

00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,960
a question here from uh jeremy feel um

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,720
what's the feedback for for a feedback

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,920
loop for these super users

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,040
um like um

00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,200
there's sort of a follow-on question

00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,440
there should the company be monitoring

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,160
the output to manage their message

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,640
um i'd argue that you know you can't

00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,839
manage

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,800
other people's message otherwise um you

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,280
have to pay them a salary um

00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,680
[Music]

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,720
but um but there is there is sort of a

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,640
question if this is

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,760
if this is part of what you're trying to

00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,400
do as

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,880
a community builder is to build up this

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,000
front line like top-tier

00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,440
set of of super fans um

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,760
how do you help them succeed at that

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,880
like what ammunition are you giving them

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,960
um

00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,400
and how can you influence i guess sort

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,359
of like what did i mean like i launched

00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,200
a new feature

00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,040
what i really want is for my super fans

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,960
to go out there and create content

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,720
that shows off like you know what this

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,400
new feature can do maybe use it in ways

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,160
that i didn't even think of

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,520
show how it fits into like a million

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,160
different workflows

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,599
and each of those super fans also they

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,200
have another foot into whatever

00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,920
communities they came from so

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,839
you know you say like react svelt view

00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,280
whatever all these front-end frameworks

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,839
i'm going to have super fans from all of

00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,680
these different sort of walks of life

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,200
and each one of them is going to take

00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,160
the new thing that i did and

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,920
show like this is how it matters to the

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,319
view community this is how it matters to

00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,359
the

00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:07,359
whatever community and that's um uh

00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:13,119
i think a very different thing so what

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:13,840
do what do you both think about that

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,559
i like it

00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,920
[Laughter]

00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,440
yeah i don't know if you if you had

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,960
connections to the aws community

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,839
builders when you're aws

00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,400
um yes yeah yeah we i nominated some

00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:29,680
yeah

00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,720
awesome yeah so at github we mentioned

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,720
the github stars

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,799
uh but we have other groups as well like

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,160
we have um some members of our support

00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,400
team that also have

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,760
a support community uh github is very

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,440
like we have 56 million

00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,960
developers worldwide which is sounds

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,640
like a flex it is

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,640
but it means that we just have multiple

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,640
groups um so

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,559
another group that you might not know we

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,000
have is we have a group of open source

00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:52,559
maintainers that we talk to on a regular

00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
basis

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,680
and it's actually a structured

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,040
conversation and a group

00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,960
and we get feedback from some of the

00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,760
largest open source projects that you've

00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,760
heard of

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,119
um and it's very important for us to

00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,520
actually treat them

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,960
with this uh well not treat them i'm

00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,000
gonna say treat them with respect but it

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,240
really is respecting their

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,839
time providing getting their feedback

00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,440
directly to the source of the people who

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,480
can actually impact that feedback

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,599
into our our platform um but as far as

00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,119
structure goes

00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,799
the structure looks like we have a

00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,119
monthly meeting with all the stars

00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:25,119
everybody's invited and we call these

00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,000
the stars inside calls and like the pms

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,319
will show up

00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,440
and talk about some really early ideas

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,280
of features

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,440
and they get to see the features sort of

00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,640
develop over the course of time until

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,000
it's ready for beta

00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,240
and at that point stars are like oh i

00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,720
knew this was coming out i'll use this

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,119
i'll

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,559
incorporate this in my team at work or

00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,960
i'll write some content whatever you

00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,000
want to do with that you just have some

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,040
interactions

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,599
and that's why we did the stars

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,000
conference which is again it wasn't a

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,880
huge public event it was more just for

00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,799
the stars

00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,240
um so it's the point where i think i've

00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,520
even used switch you'd

00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,720
mention like oh i didn't know this was a

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,079
thing i never heard of this before and i

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,640
was like because yeah we just did it and

00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,000
it's

00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,480
it's only for the stars it's not meant

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,520
to promote github in any way it's just

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,680
to give you access to all the

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,319
information

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,960
we even had a astronaut in swing by yeah

00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,240
we didn't

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,240
have an astronaut from nassau

00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,240
but in addition to that like we did have

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,000
we do give the opportunity to have some

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,920
unfiltered conversations too as well so

00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,680
one of the requirements for stars

00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,599
is to sign an nda and it's just so we

00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,960
can have some really free-form

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,680
conversation about

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,160
github the platform but also complaints

00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,520
wins

00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:37,440
everything across the board yeah

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,480
candor yeah i mean i like it i i it's a

00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,920
it's hard to organize

00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,280
i think it's a full-time job actually if

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,880
you do it if you if you want to do a

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,160
good job of it you know

00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,559
and again points to this thing becoming

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,599
because it it probably is not who i mean

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,799
i don't know who handles it but it's

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,839
probably not developer relations

00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,079
handling it

00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,880
uh it's it's just like a it is no

00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:59,040
production

00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,640
oh it isn't okay um yeah you know

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,480
i think i think this is a growing field

01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,680
where we're all sort of uh

01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,200
defining what different categories of

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,119
activities we can invest in

01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,720
uh this is one of them another trend i

01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,920
see a lot is people building

01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,960
universities

01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,960
um like apollo building an odyssey

01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,240
um nullified building jam stack

01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,559
explorers um

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,839
i forget who automation academy from

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,520
angie

01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:25,520
angie yeah well she yeah she's the og

01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,359
and then uh you know github has had labs

01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,599
or i forget what you what you guys call

01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,119
it

01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:35,760
um github.com

01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,480
yeah yeah i i tried to go through it for

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,480
actions

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,839
but i didn't really get very far to be

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,280
honest um

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,119
but i think i think you know like people

01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,119
are building like lms's like custom

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,000
custom lms's for for their learning and

01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,799
i think that's another

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,240
investment in community anyway sorry i i

01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,920
don't mean to ramble i just like these

01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,680
are all really cool trends

01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,359
where i think uh you know it's part of

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,799
the whole future of deveral thesis i

01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:00,240
guess

01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:01,680
fantastic um we are at time even a

01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,280
little bit over time

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,440
so uh um uh i think we could

01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,520
probably keep jamming on this uh for a

01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,799
while i'm going to

01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,119
uh throw up a banner on screen there's

01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,160
an

01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,520
uh a thread in octo discussions where uh

01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,520
if people have uh uh questions or maybe

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,880
uh swix if you can drop some interesting

01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,400
resources in that thread

01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,640
yeah so uh folks who uh are maybe

01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,559
uh coming at this later from the youtube

01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,680
recording or uh who didn't get a chance

01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,960
to ask a question you know and think

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,760
about it later when they're like oh

01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,720
falling asleep

01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,400
oh wow i should have asked this um um i

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,559
can drop in and uh

01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,400
and ask those questions and and and get

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,280
some follow-up engagement
