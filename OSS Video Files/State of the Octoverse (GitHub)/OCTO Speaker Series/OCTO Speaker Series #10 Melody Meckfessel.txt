Description: 
	How Visualization Is Changing How We Work With Data

The rising complexity of modern software and data is pushing the limits of human understanding. While open source collaboration is connecting millions of developers and collaborators, we need new ways to explore data and make better decisions. Data visualization is changing how we understand and sharing insights about the world.

Melody Meckfessel is the CEO and co-founder of Observable, the destination for data visualization. Observable empowers people to explore, analyze and visualize data on the web, together. Melody is a hands-on leader with decades in engineering at both startups and enterprises. Prior to Observable, she was a VP of Engineering at Google.

[Music]

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,559
hi

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
good morning welcome to the 10th episode

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,720
of the github octo speaker series

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
octo looks at the future of software

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,600
development and investigates ways to

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
make development

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
faster safer easier and more accessible

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,279
in this speaker series we invite guests

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
to help us look into that future

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,480
people with a unique perspective on

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
tools for thinking

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,680
and the craft of software and there's

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
probably

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
no more ubiquitous tool for thought than

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,239
the notebook long before computers

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
thoughts were organized in notebooks the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,320
messy process

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,160
of discovery was catalogued in notebooks

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,800
the notebook as a construct

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
occupies the spot closest to software

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
that isn't software

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
a place for creators to get their ideas

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,480
out of their heads

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,359
so that they can evaluate them spot

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,039
connections

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
and enable others to follow in their

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
footsteps

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,520
when i think about it i'm not exactly

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,200
sure what to label as the first

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
modern software notebook um uh ipython

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
was the first repel

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
that i saw that unlinked the

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
presentational aspects of a notebook

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,640
from the back end which executed the

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,040
code that i the code that i wrote

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,799
and when i look at most notebook uxes

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
today they're all to some degree

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,040
uh derivative of the the ipothen or the

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,799
the jupiter notebook uh i have cells and

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,759
i can use them to write text

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
or code and the output of running those

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,360
cells

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,200
can include graphics in some senses and

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,040
repple is a kind of notebook so

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
one key property of software notebooks

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
is in the tight feedback loop

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,240
and asking questions uh and immediately

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
seeing answers

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
but the second property and maybe the

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,960
more interesting one nowadays is that

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,560
notebooks are shareable artifacts i can

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,719
show it to another person

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
and download some of my thoughts into

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,399
their brains and this is where the

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,920
exciting developments are happening in

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,560
the space

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
so today i'm super thrilled to welcome

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
melody mack vessel ceo

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
of observable to the speaker series if

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
you haven't seen observable

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,959
it's on the cutting edge of notebooks

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
it's

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,760
javascript-ish based uh in terms of its

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
uh the language that it that it affords

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
you to write in

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
but because it runs in the browser it

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
makes it

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,800
very very easy to create visualizations

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,120
to work with data and to tell stories

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
and to share those stories with others

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
and a lot of the work that they're doing

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,120
now is in sort of figuring out

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
how to take this sort of notebook ux

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,640
that

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,720
that jupiter forged or blazed a trail in

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
and and take it into the future make it

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,760
multiplayer

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,959
make it more accessible um

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,840
we are taking questions as usual

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,040
in this octa discussion thread so please

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
absolutely jump in

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
and ask questions and i'll remind

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
everybody that we have a code of conduct

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
and we take it seriously please be kind

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,159
and welcoming

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,159
and with that hello melody

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
hi welcome to the actual speaker series

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,920
thanks so much for having me

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,360
oh thanks great to be here for coming

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
and sharing yeah

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
um i'm looking forward to hearing all

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
about uh

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,400
data visualization notebooks through the

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,159
lens of of the work that you're doing at

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,879
observable and in general

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,000
right and uh seeing seeing observable

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,840
abused into

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
into a role as

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,840
yeah exactly yes i will give a caveat i

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,959
will be using observable for this entire

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
discussion

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,080
uh so what you're seeing is is uh an

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
expression of the notebook that you just

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
mentioned

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
fantastic great what's the the new the

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
new phrase not not eat the dog food but

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,200
drink the champagne

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,200
there you go there you go we've got a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
lot at observable we do that a lot and

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,959
observable

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
well thanks so much for having me uh i'm

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
looking forward to sharing

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,319
a bit about how visualization helps us

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,280
as humans and people think and work

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,000
and uh so my name is melody i lead

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,879
observable

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
with my co-founder and friend mike

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,840
bostock

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
mike has done some pretty cool things in

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
the visualization space

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,919
namely he created uh d3 in

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360
collaboration with the community which

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
is an open source visualization

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,440
framework

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
just had its 10-year birthday slash

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
anniversary

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,320
uh in february and i'm super grateful to

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,479
work with the entire team

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
at observable i worked at google for a

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,600
number of years

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
i worked at startups and enterprise

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
companies

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
on the software development side and one

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
of the things that

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,639
really intrigued me at google was just

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,680
the ability to work

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,320
at scale around data

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,080
with software developers that were using

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,880
the services

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,160
you know just milli million billions

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
large numbers

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
of data uh and you know if we think

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
about

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
uh open source collaboration that's

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
happened happening in the world it's

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,600
connecting millions of developers

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,919
and collaborate collaborators but it all

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
revolves around source code

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,199
and we know that we don't make business

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
decisions by

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
staring at a screen and staring at

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,720
source code we we make those decisions

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,680
by looking at data

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
and i believe if we could work with data

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,840
in a way that's transparent

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,199
and collaborative uh and connected to

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
our environments

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
we can dramatically increase our ability

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
to understand the world around us

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
uh and to share that understanding with

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,479
each other

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
and with many of our teams so observable

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,680
it's a place

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,840
where you can explore data and think

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,320
with code we do that in a notebook it's

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,360
a live reactive javascript program

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,639
uh i think the very interesting thing

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,840
that uh is happening is the community

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,319
development around visualization and

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,680
uh i believe that visualization is an

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
essential tool

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919
uh for software development so all the

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,720
examples i'm going to show you today

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,080
are from the observable community so

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
you're going to see code you're going to

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,840
see

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,520
data and i really hope that you walk

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,000
away with an understanding

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,479
of how does data visualization impacts

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,600
how we think and how we work as people

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,080
and i i also just a little bit hope that

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,759
um you start to think about ways that

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,600
you can bring that into your life

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,000
and into your work so as a kid growing

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
up

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
uh it's funny you talk about the

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
physical notebook that we write notes in

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
and we and we do analysis and we work

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,039
through our ideas i used to love to

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,039
spend time at the library as a kid

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
this is a photo from the national

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,319
archives and

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
just filled me with wonder just to be

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
able to read and learn and explore

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
uh and i think it's one of the main

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
reasons that i got into computers and

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,360
computer science and software

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
development to be able to create

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
something

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,680
um to be able to explore the world

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
and many years later i remember walking

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,120
into the first

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,319
data center and seeing all of these

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
computers

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,639
and all of the sort of physical

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
expression of the machines and the

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,720
network equipment and the hardware

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,560
and just the amount of data that was

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
being generated by the world software

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,240
and so it just reminded me of the scenes

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,440
from the matrix of like just kind of

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,880
blowing your mind

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,840
about the explosion of data in the world

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
so yes data there's just way too much of

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,720
it

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,440
and we can't decouple the rise of

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,560
software from the rise of data they're

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,440
interconnected uh we have to

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
explore different formats um we have to

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
understand

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
them of the environments for managing

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,000
data are becoming more complex

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,639
we have on-premise data within companies

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,160
and we have it in the cloud in different

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,520
formats

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and the solutions that we need to

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,560
wrangle that data are also increasing

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
i talked about the different languages

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,199
that

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,199
we you know different tool sets that we

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,919
need to pick to do the task that we're

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,960
trying to do with the data

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
so from the last uh github octoverse

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,440
report which was incredible

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
lots of great insights there uh 56

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,240
million developers in the world

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,280
increasing to 100 million by 2025

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,960
and that's just that's those are

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
astounding numbers i mean you can look

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
at analysts report and see that

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,479
software development's the number one

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,680
job but i think um

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,800
what i would offer is that we these are

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,039
all the folks we're

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,320
at the root of this explosion in data

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,159
and it's it's ever increasing

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
and it's not just software developers

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
right there's a

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
tremendous amount of diversity of people

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
involved in

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
exploring and analyzing and making sense

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,560
of data

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
they we the people identify as

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,080
developers

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
data scientists analysts decision makers

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
collaborators entrepreneurs

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
students teachers all of these folks

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,399
work together and collaborate

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
uh and as software development is

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
becoming more ingrained in all these

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,839
workforce

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,519
it's it's more so than ever uh and

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
and this is increasing because software

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,920
development's becoming more accessible

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
and it's an essential part of everything

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
that we do

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,160
so i like i like formulas i like to

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,720
apply formulas here's a simple one for

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,880
you

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
which is okay if there are 56 million

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,640
developers in the world they're

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,040
increasing

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,360
we we have to work together right most

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,360
of the software in the world was

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
uh it's either open source or it's built

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
on open source we're collaborating more

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,320
around that software and that can lead

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,040
to complexity

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
so let's not underestimate our role in

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
adding to the complexity

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,680
in data and software

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
but this complexity it you know it hurts

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
us in

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,200
in multiple dimensions uh it hurts us in

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
terms of correctness

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
so the software is not doing what we

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
want it to do

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,560
which can lead to not so interesting

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
data outcomes it can be unstable it can

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
be buggy it can be insecure you can look

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
at

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
pretty serious events that happen when

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,279
we don't understand what our software is

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,600
doing

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,279
and it slows us down in terms of

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
dependencies

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
as our projects grow as our dependencies

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
grow

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,079
it's difficult for us to make sense and

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
to sort of wrap our

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
wrap our heads around it i love this

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
quote

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,160
by nancy levinson uh we are attempting

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
to build systems that are

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,760
beyond our ability to intellectually

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
manage so this is

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,959
our you know our cognitive ability

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,720
to uh understand what we're building and

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
uh i think there's a lot of wisdom in

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,240
this for us to just take a pause and

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
think about

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
if we don't do something about how we

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
can improve our

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,760
understanding of data and of the world

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,120
the complexity will keep

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,000
overwhelming us and you know cost cost

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
is a tricky thing

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
like it doesn't happen all at once we

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,240
know this it creeps up on us over time

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,160
and um you know i just think about going

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,760
out in the sunshine and feeling the

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,720
warmth of the sun

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,480
as a you know just human experience but

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,079
you don't feel that sunburn

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,839
until it's too late right and

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,720
i think that's true of the software that

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,839
we're building and having to manage

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
so for me you know thinking about

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,079
visualization

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
i always have to start with the people

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,560
that are

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
exploring the data to get to that

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,279
visualization and it's not

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,079
easy i mean it's not easy to do software

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,560
development

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
in the environment that we're in uh but

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,240
then having to interact with data and

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
with code together to make sense out of

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
it it's

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
it can be overwhelming it can be

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
confusing uh

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
there's so much urgency in the world to

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
understand and make decisions

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
based on data and what you can see

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,000
within different companies

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
is this fragmentation happening like

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
when people

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,000
uh are feel a sense of urgency

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,519
um what can happen is that they start to

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,639
come up with their own metrics on the

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,399
data

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
we start to lose things like data

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,760
governance

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,519
coming up with competing systems within

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
companies to make sense of data

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
and all of this all of these behaviors

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
that people have

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,000
the intention is to gain the insights

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,680
and to make the decisions but

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
the behaviors is it actually that

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,560
urgency creates

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,240
can can create fragmentation and that's

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,040
not good because we

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,760
um we lose that connection with the data

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,959
and our understanding of it

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,800
so uh you know the power

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,320
this quote the power to understand and

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,240
predict the quantities of the world

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,000
should not be restricted to those

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,000
now those who are people with the

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
freakish knack of manipulating abstract

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
symbols which is really computer science

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,279
and software development and my main

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
point here

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,720
is that this understanding of data our

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,200
ability to explore and analyze data

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,760
should not be limited to a select few

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
number of people everyone has to be

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,519
empowered

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
to interact with data from software from

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,480
applications

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,480
about the world and about ourselves

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
so but first we need to talk about how

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,040
we're doing all this

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,519
so if we understand the challenges and

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,320
we as humans have as it relates to data

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
and visualization is a way out of this

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
confusion

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,480
and being overwhelmed for us we have to

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,000
first look at

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
the environment that we're interacting

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,120
with i mean the web right

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
sounds may be silly uh but you know

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,519
it has changed everything about how we

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,120
communicate and connect and are

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
influenced by each other

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
we're live we're connected we can run

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,800
code with one click and we can share it

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
with anyone

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,959
uh out there javascript

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
you know um octoverse and 11 million

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
javascript developers in the world

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,880
most popular language on the web and

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
increasing it makes interactivity

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,760
possible

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,639
it makes uh the ability for us to

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,240
explore and analyze data possible

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
and there are a lot of options out there

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,760
around data programming

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,040
and visualization and i think javascript

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,440
plays an important role and we'll

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
continue to

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,639
uh and coding with data i mean

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,639
so it's complicated uh you know

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
there are multiple languages out there

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
there's lots of tools for us to choose

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,040
from the ecosystem is moving

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,000
very quickly and there's a lot to keep

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,959
up with

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,680
so we definitely have our challenges uh

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
in front of us

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,839
as we try and explore data and bring

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,279
visualization to it

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
but i do think there is this like

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,040
trifecta of

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,360
amazing improvements in the browser

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,600
uh using javascript and the web that

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,480
come together and it's this combination

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,320
right now at this point in time in in

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,000
software development and in the world

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,480
that makes data exploration and data vis

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
possible uh in the browser and it gives

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
us all this ability to explore and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,440
create together to collaborate

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,440
in notebooks uh in the browser uh and to

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,320
see each other's work and to be able to

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,079
communicate

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,639
more effectively to get to those better

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
decisions

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,199
so you have that trifecta and then here

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,199
comes

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,360
you know visualization libraries on top

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,040
of that things like d3

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,959
and other tools for building dynamic

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,160
data visualization and it has led to

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,440
this renaissance

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,360
in information visualizations on the web

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,759
in the last decade it's brought the

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,160
power of data exploration

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,040
out into the world and it's closed this

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
loop for us

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,519
of the environment that we're in to be

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,519
able to make sense out of data together

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
i think it's empowered a lot of people

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
millions of people in the world to gain

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,800
more insights

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
by having these libraries available now

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
they're not you know it's not easy you

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,639
have to do the work

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,130
but i think we all can be part of making

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,480
um

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,800
[Music]

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
this combination of work that we do on

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,399
the web in the browser

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,160
using javascript and or other languages

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,720
and using the libraries themselves to

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,000
help our

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,320
to help ourselves do this work so

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,040
i believe visualization is a tool for

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
thinking

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,240
for all of us and it's it's a means to

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,480
an

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
end but that means is the insight that

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
we gain

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
we can use visualization to generate

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,560
ideas to improve

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
our research and our creation we can use

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,959
visualization to explain things to

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,199
support how we learn and how we teach

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,360
uh and and through it we gain the

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,920
insights to make the better decisions

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
and there's kind of this this this path

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
of like

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,959
there's the data that we're exploring we

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,279
collaborate on that data

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,000
in order to communicate and then to

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
drive change

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
from that to drive positive change and

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,720
improvements from that

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,320
so but the bright shiny thing at

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,000
observable you know we may call it the

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,039
bright shiny thing that the viz

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,799
itself uh or maybe it's the squirrel

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,160
that you know the thing that's out there

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,760
that we can pay attention to

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
but let's talk a little bit about the

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
data science process itself like why do

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,520
we do this

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
whole process i mean visualizations kind

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,640
of

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,839
it can be the thing at the end right it

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,240
can also be the

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
the expression and the exploration along

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,199
the way

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,440
so we we we do this process right to

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,600
to understand to collaborate to

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,520
communicate to drive change but

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,919
you know we form a question or a

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,360
hypothesis and then we use the data to

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,240
test it

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,480
through statistics and through that

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
visualization and it's a very iterative

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,840
process

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,799
just like software development each

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,640
iteration

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
involves transformation it involves

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
modeling involves

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,919
the visualization of the data and it's

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
that iteration that drives the creative

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,360
process

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,679
our goal through this entire process is

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,240
a new understanding

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,760
and um you know if if

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,320
most of the time when we're looking at

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
data we we don't actually know what

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
we're looking for

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
at the beginning and we have to make it

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,679
up as we go along

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,360
uh in order to support that creativity

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
we need expressiveness and that

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,520
expressiveness comes through

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,679
writing code um for this task so we

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
can't just focus on the visualization we

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,640
actually need to engage

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,960
in uh the entire process of

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
analysis and data wrangling and

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
exploration

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,600
uh and how the visualization assists in

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
that uh

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,880
but today you know the data science

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,880
process it's

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,080
in many cases very siloed it's a

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,720
different toolset

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
than software we're using us as software

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,840
developers

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,440
uh and a lot of times it can look like

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,919
throwing things over the wall

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
uh and shipping static content so losing

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,600
the interactivity and losing the

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,440
iteration that happens in this process

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,960
uh i don't know about you i love to

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,200
choose your own adventure stories

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
as a kid and i think it's very

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
applicable to

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,679
uh data exploration and visualization

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
where we

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,120
all get to decide on the past that we

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
take through the data and it's plural

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
right we take

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,919
multiple paths through the data and we

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
reach these decision points in terms of

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,200
where we're going to go next and what

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
question we're going to ask next and how

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,960
that gets expressed through the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,440
visualization

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,360
so uh visualization offers us an

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
opportunity to move beyond

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,520
the terminal and the static text that

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,559
source code that's in front of us

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,600
uh to have more ways to collaborate uh

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,160
and more ways to ask those really tough

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,080
questions

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:46,320
of the data so that's a little bit about

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,760
how how we think i want to talk next

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,720
about how it how visualization helps us

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,799
in our work

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,919
so i'm going to share some examples now

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,919
from

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
software in the software development

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,440
space how visualization helps and then

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
i'm going to share a couple

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,640
of customer kind of more businessy

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
examples

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
of how visualization can be used to help

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,320
people connect

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,679
and make better decisions so you know we

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,679
can use visualization

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
in our own software development in just

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,039
about anything i

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,960
really believe this and i would

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,120
encourage you to think about

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,080
creating database and data exploration

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,559
just as another

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,120
flavor of software development right so

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,000
we may identify as a back-end developer

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,679
front-end developer full stack um

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
database is another type of software

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,240
development

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,559
uh you know we're writing code to

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
interact with data

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,960
so i'm going to show you a bunch of

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,240
examples just to kind of maybe inspire

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
you to think about it

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,840
a lot of these are github-centric so i

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,520
hope they'll resonate

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
this is an observable notebook that's

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,360
embedded in

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
the notebook that i'm showing you uh to

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,200
explore

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,480
uh how code is organized and you can

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
kind of zoom back

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
and this is for observable standard

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,120
library but you can kind of just

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,280
visually look at this and see oh okay

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
like i can kind of get the relationships

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
that exist

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,200
in this code um and maybe spend some

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,120
time exploring and learning

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
and then maybe have some questions maybe

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,760
i'm trying to think i'm gonna go write a

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
p

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,080
another piece of code here and this is

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,919
going to help me be more effective

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,360
maybe you don't want to look at it as

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,640
that force director grab but maybe you

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,960
want to look at it as clap

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,799
as a collapsible tree where you can i

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
mean this is a simple example but maybe

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,799
you want to be able to

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,640
explore in a different way and that's

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,120
how you visually

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
can understand the code base more

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
effectively

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,080
maybe you want to look at file sizes and

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,159
you want to explore and so you can start

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,760
to bring some interactivity i'll just go

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,880
back to the top level

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,120
and see the relative sizes of

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,039
the code tree and kind of drill down and

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,720
take a look and understand what's there

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,240
and learn to be more effective

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,240
maybe at the next piece of code that

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,080
you're going to go right

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,919
or maybe you want to see it in file size

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
bubbles i mean there's just so much

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,080
diversity and expression here

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,120
that we can bring to our understanding

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,600
of code

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,320
that can inform our work in so many i

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,760
think really interesting ways

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,640
that take us beyond that kind of flat

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,520
text

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
on a screen this one i think is really

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,480
cool

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
it's showing the relationships between

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,159
code

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,240
so you can see these edges here for

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
imports between source and target

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
so if i was looking at this i'm like oh

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
wow look at all of these relationships

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
around the data classes well you know

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,640
that makes sense

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,080
but maybe i'm gonna am i gonna make some

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,960
code changes there maybe i'm going to

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
think twice

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,400
about what i'm going to do when i get

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
into that code

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,600
and maybe i can see there's some areas

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,679
which are pretty independent and

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
isolated

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,679
but maybe you know i'm asking questions

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,280
with my team around

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,280
new pieces of code we're going to write

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,039
refactoring to make the code better

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,720
and this visualization is going to help

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
us have that discussion and start that

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
collaboration

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,120
so a lot of things that you can do like

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,480
visualizing integration tests

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,080
or looking at how

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,760
code throughput and the rate of changes

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,440
this is an example from someone in the

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,880
community of some pull request analysis

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,520
and showing showing those visualizations

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
uh over issues and time which is pretty

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
cool

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,559
uh it's kind of like there aren't any

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
limits it's really about

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,760
what you want to do and the types of

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,320
questions you want to ask

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,000
so i'm gonna this is a visualization

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,880
around the d3

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,279
um code contributions and you can kind

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
of

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,200
let me go back here if you can see this

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,120
and then i'm gonna press

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,159
play and this was a while ago

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,279
oh what's happening melody

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,279
um okay

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
uh it seems like the notebook may have

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,400
crashed but um

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,400
you know real time demos uh it shows a

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,270
graph of contributions

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,480
um let me just see if i can get it back

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:18,000
[Music]

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,159
see demo real time let me see if

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
i can there we go let's see if it'll

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,880
come back thank you

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,200
in advance for your patience uh

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
okay here we go let's see what happens

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,520
it's this is d3 over time you can see

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,919
the year

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,039
and things start to really okay let's

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,720
whoa look at that

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,799
look at all the contributors and you can

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
start to see um

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
you know just the different

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,120
contributions so there's a lot of really

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
fun ways to do this

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,840
um to understand what's happening in the

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,080
code base and that can inform us

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,360
uh when we're you know trying to make

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,400
decisions about what we're going to do

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
with the code

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,720
so here's another brett victor quote

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,559
which i think summarizes it for

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
for software development for me people

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,080
understand what they can see

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
if a programmer can't see what a program

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,000
is doing she can't understand

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,919
it and i think that's where the power of

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,799
visualization can come into our software

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,960
development

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,880
we have these questions about our code

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,679
we have questions about dependencies we

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
take

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,039
we have questions about how to make

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,960
things better how can we use

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,559
visualization to do that

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,520
it's super powerful and an example of

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,960
that

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,320
can be when we look at you know

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,520
how algorithms run and um and just

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,400
actually observe it

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
and maybe in some way have new insights

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,279
around

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,240
what what decisions we want to make in

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,400
the software that we're writing

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,520
so uh let me just show you a couple of

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
customer examples

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,799
in terms of using visualization to make

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
better decisions and

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,039
collaborate and i think it it does when

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
we're having to interact with data

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,240
together

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,320
and it changes how we work and it

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
changes how we collaborate so

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,159
people come together to work in teams

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
and they have very different roles data

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,080
scientists data analysts developers

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
what we want to do is break down the

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,000
walls to enable all those people to

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,279
collaborate more effectively

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
so let's look at a couple different

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,760
examples stitch fix

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,120
clothing service recommendation service

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,480
big in data science um you know

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,600
uh i'm not a big shopper so it's awesome

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,039
get close close delivered what they did

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,240
was they brought together

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,360
uh different um different roles in the

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,080
notebook

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,520
to give more autonomy and to increase

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
the speed at which they were making

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,320
decisions

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,279
so they you know they created notebooks

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,000
and they were able to iterate on their

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
models

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,159
and tweak and visualize it and then

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,000
share it broadly within the organization

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,760
so they kind of broke down those those

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
walls in the garden that was separating

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,760
people from collaborating

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,960
um trace uh which uh

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,840
is trying to uh trying to just

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,400
increase productivity within their

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,400
organization uh

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,679
they were using notebooks this is

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,799
actually from their public

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,000
i think their public website uh to do

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,440
uh analysis on different areas of the of

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,480
the business and stitch together

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,039
different visualizations to decide uh

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
on um yeah just decisions that they were

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,760
making

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
uh across multiple parts of the

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,720
organization

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,840
summat which is as a bio pharmaceutical

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,360
company

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,640
was uh trying to not just

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,840
make better decisions but reduce cost of

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,200
operations and so they felt like by

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,360
bringing different people of different

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,840
skill sets together in the notebook

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,520
against their own secure private data

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,120
they were able to be more

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,000
effective and empower more people this

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,720
is an example

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,399
of them looking at how they connect um

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,159
you can kind of see it here

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,080
connect with the right patients for um

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
the projects that they were working on

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
and they were able to have this level of

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
autonomy that enabled them to move much

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,080
much faster than before

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,600
so you know this was the hierarchical

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,399
edge bundling one that i showed you

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,399
which was

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,320
more on a software structure well this

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,720
is being applied to

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,320
uh to people and decisions that they

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,039
were making around connecting

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,000
with the right um people that were in

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,120
there

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,240
in their um yeah in their business so

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,919
it's pretty cool to see the different

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,200
applications that you can bring to

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,880
visualizations and again like all of

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,840
this is with the intention that we have

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,159
more insights

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,600
through those visualizations we're able

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,640
to make more sense of it

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,760
um because of the

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
visual aspects of understanding the data

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
and that leads to better communication

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,960
decision making and hopefully improving

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,480
improving the human experience so

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
that's a little bit about visualization

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,200
how it helps us think how

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,320
it helps us work but how about how it

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,159
helps us collaborate uh so if we know

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,360
that there are more developers

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,159
in the world that have to collaborate uh

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,960
and the complexity is a natural outcome

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,440
uh

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,399
you know it it can be pretty easy for us

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,520
then to spend

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,240
all of you know our time on technical

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
matters

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,279
if we're balancing the churn we're

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,799
trying to figure things out that can

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,679
take all of our energy

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,279
and i would offer that we need to we

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,960
need to check ourselves and challenge

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,919
ourselves to stay focused on the

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,799
insights

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,480
and on thinking um are we asking the

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,880
right questions of the data

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,200
is this the right data uh to be looking

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,000
at uh what are we trying to understand

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,399
together

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
and if there are more of us now how do

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,600
we shift our behavior

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,480
um to help find those answers together

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,960
so i don't know i was big into drama um

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
in

00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,640
in uh back in the day and

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:04,080
uh i just um i had a drama teacher who

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,399
really wanted us to use improv uh and

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,520
something recently struck me about

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
improv

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,039
there's two rules of it you have to

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,120
agree uh

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,559
you don't have to agree you have to

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,559
acknowledge maybe i should say you have

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,120
to acknowledge you have to say yes

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,600
and then you add to which is the and so

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,880
it's the

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,880
simple yes and and i think there's so

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
much there's so many similarities

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,399
between improv

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,880
and software development whether it's

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,360
proprietary software or open source

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,159
this idea of how are we in flow with

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
each other

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,520
how do we bring creativity and

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,399
positivity and fun

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,320
and not have to go it alone so i pulled

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,279
this from the github website you know

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,480
this is a pull request flow and i just i

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,520
just want to offer like

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,080
we still spend so much of our time

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,919
in software and in data exploration

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,720
coding alone

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,799
so we write the pull request right and

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,039
of course we send it out for review

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,919
and we solicit input but a lot of that

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,960
is still asynchronous interactions

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,960
and this that that async sort of way

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,320
sending and waiting is really

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
challenging when it comes to working

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
with data

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,159
because there's there's a lot of latency

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,799
there and it's

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,399
it's hard to get in flow with someone

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,440
when we have these sort of back and

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,559
forth

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,120
so uh i don't i don't know if familiar

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,799
there's imposter syndrome there's kind

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,240
of different expressions or ways of

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,480
talking about that

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,519
um one of us is called one of the

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,399
imposter syndrome

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,320
sort of personas is called the soloist

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,679
this was definitely my default

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,360
uh in software development and uh

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,880
this idea that you have to do it all on

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,399
your own and i think actually if you

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,039
look at the workflow around software

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,399
development it actually reinforces this

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,559
so while we're working on that pr alone

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,000
um our teammates help with that but you

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,559
have this sort of ping pong

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,760
um of waiting and it reinforces that you

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,519
kind of you kind of

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,880
you got to do a lot of the work on your

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,039
own

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,200
so how do we come out of that and we

00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,120
come out of that by

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
building shared experiences together

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,320
creating things together

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,240
uh this brene brown big fan um

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,240
trust is a product of vulnerability that

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,760
grows over time and requires

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,240
work attention and full engagement and

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
you know okay so if we don't do the

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,320
async

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
back and forth um and we try and come up

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,720
with a process that

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,880
that supports our creativity even

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,880
pairing and real-time collaboration can

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
be super intimidating

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,559
because we are making mistakes in the

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,640
presence of someone else

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,159
uh and there's so much vulnerability in

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
creating with someone else and i think

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,640
we need to find another way

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,000
we need to find a way to normalize uh

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
that software development

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,559
and data exploration and data vis as a

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,279
way of

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,000
of developing software is really messy

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
and and

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,320
we are humans and we are messy and i

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,120
think it could be pretty amazing to

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,440
normalize that

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,159
so this is a clip of some multiplayer

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,799
editing

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,640
uh that happens in the notebook where

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,360
you know really we can kind of watch

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,320
our teammates avatars as they're just

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,360
writing code

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,039
and as they're communicating and you

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,159
kind of can get this mind melt that

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,559
happens where you're like

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,519
oh okay like we're gonna go do that

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,279
together

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,240
and then if you take that to data

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
writing code together to explore data

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,399
and you can see the

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,360
impact of your code and interacting with

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,080
the data real time in the database

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
and riff and make mistakes together and

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,000
just

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,919
keep iterating i mean this is a

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,840
visualization around weather but it's

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,159
you know you can apply it to anything

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,399
it's pretty cool to be able to

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
sit together especially in the world

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,640
that we're in now

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,080
uh where we remote collaboration is so

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,240
important to be able to

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,440
to do this together and to be with each

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,640
other uh

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,679
in this way so uh

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,240
improv the beauty of yes and

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,720
uh we have the ability to literally

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,399
create

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,919
things out of nothing with the other

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,040
people that we work with in software

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,359
development

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,320
and i think all that creativity can come

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,240
out in d

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
in our exploration of data and our

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,560
creation of data visualization if we can

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,960
get over our own intimidation

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,720
and tap into creativity for ourselves

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,000
and for other people

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,000
and i think this is the way of open

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,079
source software development right

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,839
build it put it out there someone sees

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,359
it someone gets value out of it

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,240
they add to it uh and and i think at the

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,720
root of this is

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,879
with data visualization is really

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,159
finding ways that we can change the

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,879
the frequency that we as people connect

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,280
and create together

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,000
so i want to show a couple of examples

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,359
of

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,599
how uh you know um

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,520
data visualization is leading to more

00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,119
data storytelling

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,000
and we can use visualization to tell

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,720
stories about

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,359
our world we are members of a global

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,280
community

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:12,240
community and we can contribute to

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,400
areas that impact all of us we are all

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,640
consuming and understanding data

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,839
and visualizations make a lot of that

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,359
possible

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
and i think the good news is that we're

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,839
more empowered than ever before

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
to share our insight and stories in the

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,680
browser

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,560
on the web um the insights that we have

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
with each other

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
so i wanted to share a couple of

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,000
different examples

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
uh this was one that was created on

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,280
observable

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,760
uh it's looking at um the coronavirus

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,040
uh reopening it's a heat map across a

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,160
bunch of different counties

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:51,200
it was done by the la la times datadesk

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,839
but you know well and i think it's

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,000
pretty

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,480
um profound to see the number of data

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,480
visualizations that have happened around

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
the coronavirus which affect all of us

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,400
and now

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,520
um you know looking at reopening and

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,119
things changing

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,800
there's a way that visualization can

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,480
communicate data

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,560
pretty quickly and effectively uh

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,880
this is a data visualization to track

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,920
legislation that's anti-trans to raise

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,000
awareness

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,280
uh and you can actually kind of scroll

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,320
through and

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,280
um see data that's publicly available

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,160
uh and you know if if we didn't create

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
the visualization

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,920
around it maybe perhaps we wouldn't know

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,960
um

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,760
some of this information so let me get

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,960
down

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,720
to here this is another example

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,400
of looking at racial demographic data

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,640
from the census and trying to look at it

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,680
over time

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:54,800
and yeah using different

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,480
different tools to bring together d3

00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,839
census data i think using

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,560
i think this one's using mapbox as well

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,760
this is another visualization that is

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,560
looking at

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,760
c level changes and the impact of the

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,240
world

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
and it's just kind of like mind-blowing

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,200
to be able to see the expression of this

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
data

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,760
in a visualization around climate change

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,280
and i think there's one more that i

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
wanted to show

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,480
yeah this was one that was done for

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,720
women's history month

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,640
uh looking at the analysis of nobel

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,720
prize winner winners

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,040
and um some interesting questions to ask

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,320
around looking at this data and looking

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,520
at the um

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,480
the reason behind it so

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,200
uh you know i think you know we can we

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,200
can apply

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,720
visualization to how we think we can

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,880
apply it to how we work

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,119
as software developers and as developers

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,000
that collaborate with many other people

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,359
and we can actually for our own interest

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,240
use visualization

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,000
to explore areas that we care about

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,280
whether it's social justice

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,280
or finance or fitness or health

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,720
or gaming there's this beautiful

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
partnership between

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
data exploration and visualization that

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,920
for us

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,119
as people it's consumable by a broad

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,800
diverse audience

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,240
and we're in a position at this point in

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,480
time to make to make it

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,720
you know to make it available and to put

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,640
it out there in the world

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,720
so with that i just i want to share a

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,000
couple of um closing thoughts

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
uh challenges yes there are many right

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,560
we know that data is not information uh

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,079
we have to do a lot of work to transform

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,359
it to make it meaningful

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,839
uh and most of our time and

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,440
visualization is spent on the data

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,880
uh we have to think about the visual

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,880
channels um

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
uh some of them are less effective we

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,480
have to think about color

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,079
and we have to do the work we also have

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,520
to think about the tools that we need to

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,839
do the task at hand

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,560
we can't just you know wave a magic wand

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,880
like doing

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,599
doing this takes time and the good news

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,160
is we can

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,599
we can do it together visualization

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,480
helps us see and understand

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,800
information in really new ways it taps

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,640
into our visual system our eyes

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,400
it can help improve our confidence we

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,760
can see trends and we can discover

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,560
surprises

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,599
and we can more easily communicate with

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,359
each other

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,440
so it's just really not surprising that

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,160
visualization is playing this role

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,920
uh in you know the charts and graphs and

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,359
the maps that we use to make sense out

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,880
of the world

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,280
it's helping us to ask really good

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,359
questions and identify patterns

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,800
and data really is the foundation of

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,640
most things in our connected

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,560
interconnected world and i believe that

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
working with data is an essential skill

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,839
that we're all going to need to have

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
whether we're a developer or data

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,680
scientist or a hobbyist

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,240
you mentioned earlier this idea of

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,000
feedback and you saw that example

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,480
of being able to get this feedback

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,280
quickly to make decisions real time we

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,359
know that

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,119
when we're writing code if there's a

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,440
tight loop in the iteration

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,359
uh we get to the we get to the insights

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,880
much faster so it helps us learn and it

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,720
helps us move on to the next thing that

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,240
we're gonna do

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,119
and we're stronger together than we are

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,000
alone right the explosion of software

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,280
um and what's happened in open source or

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
ability for anyone

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,560
to learn and share from each other to

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,560
fork that example

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,079
all that creativity happens when we work

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,599
together and i think

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,079
um the power of making

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,000
data available is is just like we have

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,760
to come back to how we help each other

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,839
how we share techniques and tools and

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,040
insights and i'm really inspired by

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,720
what's happening in the data

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,480
visualization community

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,640
um we have to empower everyone to

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,960
collaborate not just coders not just the

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,280
experts but everyone

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,520
and we need to make it available um you

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,319
know share what we've created

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,760
uh do it directly in a notebook or in a

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,720
piece of code that you're writing

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,119
and that helps us all be more informed

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,280
about the data

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,200
i think it's more fun i don't know maybe

00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,760
i'm biased like working

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,920
by yourself with some you know some code

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,599
like i think we can be inspired by each

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,359
other whatever our skill set

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,839
skill level is we can build on each

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,319
other's work uh we can learn from each

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,599
other

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:11,359
and i think there's this beautiful

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,960
network effect that happens that we all

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,599
benefit from

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,000
uh and we do that in community right we

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,359
do that in the communities that we're in

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,359
and we have such an amazing opportunity

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,920
um just i you know our brains

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,680
time they're finite i think we should

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,640
make best use of them and i think we do

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,560
that together

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,040
uh especially around visualization so

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,079
i think um i would just encourage you to

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,000
think about how you can bring

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,359
visualization to how you think about the

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,760
world to your work

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,400
and uh and hopefully that you do

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,720
together

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,079
uh share what you know and and connect

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,000
with others around the power of data

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,280
visualization

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,960
so thank you for listening and i hope

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,240
you will take a moment to check out

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,319
observable

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,640
uh the community is super inspiring

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,280
creating some amazing visualizations

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,760
and i think we're gonna ask answer

00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,760
questions

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,720
fantastic melody that was that was

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,119
excellent and

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,640
and the demo foo worked it was not there

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,839
except for that one moment in the middle

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,839
there's a little refreshment

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,960
it's not that one refresh i think that's

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,319
a that's a

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,920
that's a good low acceptable like number

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,280
of refreshes in the middle of the

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,560
live demo um fantastic

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,359
i i've been using uh observable and and

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,079
before that

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,520
uh run kit and before that jupiter and

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,319
before as as

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,040
um a means for for exploring things but

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,240
observable

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,800
is i think um one of the

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,839
first platforms that i've seen that is

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,760
actively

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,160
trying to push the notebook format

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,520
forward you talk about um these

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,119
notebooks as tools for

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,000
sharing um for both iterating like you

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,560
know the solo work

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,240
that we do alone yeah but also the the

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,880
turning around and sharing it with other

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,680
people

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,400
um and one of the most interesting

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,359
things that jump

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,240
out to me about the um the sharing

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,240
aspect

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,359
is that observable made conscious

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,720
choices

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,960
to break or change how

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,800
notebooks execute for example in service

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,960
of making it easier because

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
one of the common trip ups that i would

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,359
have and everybody has with

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,160
um with ipython notebooks is that the

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,720
cell

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,800
order from top to bottom not necessarily

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,480
the order in which the cells executed

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
and observable said you know what

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,280
anytime something changes anything that

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,079
depends on that cell will automatically

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,400
re-execute

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,200
and that was that was a difference so i

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,280
think

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,480
um one of the the sort of deepest

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,480
questions i have about

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,680
notebooks and the future of notebooks is

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,760
um

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,960
um how how do you think the notebook ux

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,160
in general needs to evolve both to make

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,359
it more accessible

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,960
to others and to make it um better

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,200
than that i think right now we're all

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,599
still sort of doing notebooks

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,040
with a rebel accent because that's sort

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,359
of like what it grew out of

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,280
we're doing television like it was radio

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,400
you know um

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,880
what would native like a native future

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
for

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,079
notebooks look like i know this is kind

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,079
of a woolly question but like

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,119
where do we where does this thing need

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,680
to grow

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,839
or change um so that more people can

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,240
derive value from it

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,359
yeah that's it that's a great question i

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,680
you're right and that

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
data flow in the observable notebook

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,640
makes it possible i mean we're always

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,640
compiling in the background

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,040
and i you know um had done some research

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,319
in the past around you know what makes

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,079
developers productive

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,760
and staying in flow is like one of the

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,880
biggest things like whenever you have to

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,480
wait for compile time

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,319
you have to wait for feedback to go

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,880
debug the error that you encounter you

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,480
you get out of flow and so there is

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,800
something magical in

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,880
the observable notebook functioning kind

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,119
of like a spreadsheet

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,960
in that uh you're getting that immediate

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,119
feedback and you're able to debug

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,280
i think there's a lot of uh opportunity

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,440
to if you think about the process of

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,880
dataviz there's a lot of little things

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,480
that you need along the way

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,079
when you're exploring data and when

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,480
you're bringing the visualization

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,680
together and i think there's a lot of

00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,119
room for improvement

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,440
in how we help creators uh

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,640
whatever their background may be to find

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,800
those little snippets

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,160
of like helpers that they can bring into

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,319
their data vis

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,839
and i don't think it has to be purely

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,800
like um

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,560
ui like i think we can stay in code we

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,160
want to stay in code essentially to keep

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,480
that expressiveness going so that we

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,839
don't have to hit a wall in our work

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,760
and i also think there's this

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,760
opportunity to help help

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,040
um ourselves and each other build on

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,359
each other's work by

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,560
having reusable components you know i

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,280
think there's a lot of

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,040
people are using imports uh there's so

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,599
many different ways that this is coming

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,960
coming into being uh so that's one

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,960
aspect of kind of bringing more

00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,319
reusability more discovery into the

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,319
notebook as you're creating

00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,000
and getting trying to get that job done

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,640
the other aspect that i would say

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,680
is that there's a lot to learn around

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,440
interacting with data

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,520
wrangling data and creating the

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,319
visualization i think there's a lot of

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,920
opportunity

00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,760
in the notebook environment to help

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,200
folks learn in the context of the job

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,400
that they're trying to get done

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,079
and i'd like to see that improve

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,200
because if we believe if we if we sort

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,480
of believe that

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
exploring data and creating

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,599
visualizations is an essential skill for

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,960
for humans for people then how can we

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,960
make that more accessible

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,319
and approachable to a diverse audience

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,000
where it's not just limited to the

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,440
experts

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
it's not just limited to the people i

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,079
mean you know more people are learning

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,640
javascript

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,119
so i'd like to see both the reusability

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,119
uh

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,440
and the learning aspect continue to

00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,400
evolve and improve in the notebook

00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,119
i'd love to hear what amelia thinks um i

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,319
totally agree and i actually had

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,440
a question running off your answer

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,480
first of all amazing talk i loved it um

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,240
i thought it was really insightful and

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,000
um i want to ask i've used

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,480
observable a lot i really like how you

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,559
can reuse like so i don't have to

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,040
start from scratch like i want to make

00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,880
this custom database but i can pull

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,559
in a legend from another notebook or

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,960
like different pieces

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,680
and i think it's gotten really easy to

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,319
create

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,720
a really complicated database and i've

00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,240
heard

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:39,280
practice practitioners kind of wary

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,720
of how easy it's becoming

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,119
to create data visualizations um and

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,000
there's a few skills that go into making

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,079
like a really good

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
data visualization there's both the

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,119
skills to actually create it but there's

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,839
also

00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,400
like like data literacy and database

00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,960
design

00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,160
and making sure you're responsible

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,520
responsibly

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,119
representing the data yeah so are these

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,839
is that something that you all think

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,160
about it observable and

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,040
do you have any ideas for how to make

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,319
sure

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,520
as the skills part gets easier

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,119
um the like being responsible while

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,319
representing a data part

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,000
um is also represented

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,599
yeah thank you so much for bringing that

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,319
up and thank you for all the work that

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,599
you do

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,000
uh in database it's super inspiring

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,839
i i it's interesting you bring up data

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,400
literacy i think about data literacy a

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,440
lot

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,079
um literacy in terms of the availability

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,240
to read to learn to read and write and

00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,400
to do that as it applies to data

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,599
there is a lot of responsibility in that

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,240
and i think

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,319
uh one of the things that i i think we

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,720
want to do at observable is contribute

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,400
to

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,079
how we increase data literacy in the

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,520
world but that it does come with

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,240
responsibility

00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,720
and i think um we can do that in

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,359
collaboration with the community

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,800
uh you know there's principles of like

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:06,079
how you present the data

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,480
right that you can misrepresent it and

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,839
i think this is a problem that works

00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,720
it's a challenge that we're seeing in

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,599
the world

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,240
how can we assist in that uh and still

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,520
support

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,880
people's creative exploration by making

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,640
suggestions around

00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,720
you know there's some standard database

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,960
principles when you think about

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,440
you know color and you think about

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,040
citing sources and you think about

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,720
showing the logic that you use to

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,400
manipulate the data these are all

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,720
important practices that i think we can

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,760
bring

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,280
into the creative process uh and you

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,960
know we don't we don't have all the

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,160
answers but i think what we do want to

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,400
do is create that

00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,520
in collaboration with the community the

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,359
larger community

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,440
you know the community within observable

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,760
and outside of observable

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,040
uh to you know to make the world better

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,400
and to make the database

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,200
better um i think what i've seen too in

00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,000
the community

00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,000
amelia is is people commenting and

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
people making suggestions along those

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,559
lines so if someone is maybe

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,599
earlier in their journey in dativiz

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,760
getting help

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,040
right like getting a suggestion about

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,839
hey did you try this

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,559
i use this you know i use this bit in my

00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,000
database

00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:20,000
and um it assisted

00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,680
um so yeah i think those patterns of

00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,599
creating an environment where you build

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,680
trust and people feel safe

00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,880
to not know how to do it right but to

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,319
learn along the way

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,640
is an important part of what we're

00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,800
trying to do and observable

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,079
yeah i totally agree and that last part

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,880
is so important of

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,440
uh being okay with making mistakes

00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,119
because i

00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,640
i think it does have a really good

00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,599
community and

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,240
um people don't tend to get really

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,200
defensive

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,240
but that's usually when uh like conflict

00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,559
arises

00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,280
yeah yeah it's a challenge in in

00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,839
software

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,559
right like developers have we all have

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,559
strong opinions

00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,920
and no i mean we could argue there's a

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,680
right and wrong way but really

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,280
there's a lot of flexibility and

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,839
creativity in terms of what we bring

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,160
into it

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,000
and so i think what i want unobservable

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,559
is to build a place that's inclusive and

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,480
where you can you can be messy and we

00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,359
can normalize mistakes when you're pair

00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,960
programming in a notebook we all see

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:19,240
that we don't know it all

00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,040
and i think there's some beautiful

00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,040
self-reinforcing

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,720
behavior when we're like witnessing our

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,079
own mistakes and someone witnessing them

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,960
and then witnessing their mistakes it's

00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,480
like it's okay

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,680
you know it doesn't have to be perfect

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,400
like we're going to figure it out

00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:36,000
together along the way

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,160
totally i i think you know

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
over the course of of my career every

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,040
time i've done client work one of the

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,400
sort of

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,839
um mantras that i that i fell back on

00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,520
was always present sketches and pencil

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,520
because um in the the medium inherently

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,319
communicates the unfinished nature

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,760
of the the thing that i'm showing off

00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,440
you know if i show

00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,960
polished mock-ups people are like oh

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,280
it'll it'll be this is

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,400
this is mostly baked it'll be ready next

00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,880
week but

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,880
by showing things in pencil everybody

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,599
implicitly buys into the fact that this

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,520
thing

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,119
is unfinished it's still a work in

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,760
progress that it's okay

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,040
to adjust and and it's okay for it to

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,240
maybe be wrong

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,480
um so in some ways

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,000
you're talking about observable as the

00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,559
the developer's pencil

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,119
you know a way not just to show off an

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,119
idea

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,720
but to make it okay to say and you know

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,200
this is maybe wrong

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,200
it's maybe unfinished it could be better

00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,400
please jump in and and make marks

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,680
together with me

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,040
but what this sort of uh um um

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,800
carries the question that it carries

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,640
right after it is then um

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,640
how how should notebooks be versioned

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,319
how should they interact with other

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,520
versioning software like git

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:55,200
i know that on github we have a ton of

00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,520
folks that are checking in you know the

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,480
numbers on uh on jupiter notebooks that

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,160
are checked into

00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:06,240
github daily or you know staggering um

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,400
people clearly want to not just have

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,760
the notebook but also be able to look

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,559
back over time and see

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,040
how that notebook evolved um i'm curious

00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,680
sort of

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,040
what you know you're right on the the

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,240
cutting edge of this you know

00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,839
what as collaboration and notebooks

00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,440
grows and especially as sort of the

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,839
multiplayer thing that you're building

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,480
takes off um what does versioning look

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,559
like in that

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,680
in that environment or are there any

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,720
thoughts that you have about that i'm

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,960
really curious

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,559
yeah that's a great question i it's

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,760
especially important

00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,119
for teams that are making business

00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,880
decisions based on

00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:46,240
the notebook at that point in time so

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,839
we do have a history and you can check

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,319
out history and you can see what people

00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,000
have done

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,760
and you can go back and take a look and

00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,040
learn from that i

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,280
think there's a lot of room for

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,319
improvement in terms of being able to

00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,400
save state

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,800
you know there's interactivity that

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,280
people bring into the notebook so

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,319
if you think about i'm trying to make a

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,200
business decision

00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,720
around some aspect of my business and

00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,680
i'm trying to understand the data

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,319
in a certain region and i want to bring

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,760
people into that decision making process

00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,240
i can add interactivity to explore the

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,119
data

00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,319
sliders filters like whatever it might

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,920
be

00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
to help folks they don't have to

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,440
understand they don't have to view the

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,920
code right they don't have to view the

00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,920
logic

00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,960
that's optional but they can explore the

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,119
data and they can ask

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,400
interesting questions and i think

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,119
there's a

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,000
what i what i hear in your question is

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,599
you know there's a next

00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,599
evolution that needs to happen with a

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,359
notebook to save that

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:48,160
to save that kind of point in time um

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,960
here's the here's the state that we were

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,119
exploring

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,640
around this data because the data is

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,160
going to evolve and change

00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,839
right and we want that we want that to

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,559
be a feature not a bug

00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,440
and we also want to understand what the

00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,200
inputs were

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,720
into that decision at a certain point of

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,319
time and so

00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,680
what i expect that we'll see in

00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,000
notebooks and what we've been thinking

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,640
about

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,280
observable is how to make that easy for

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,280
people of

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,520
again many different roles like the

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,960
exact gets the interactive data vis

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,319
right and they're playing around and

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,480
trying to make a decision

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:20,400
and the scientists and the developers

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,319
and the analysts are all providing input

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,640
and then the decision gets made

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,559
we proceed with that we may do a

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,960
postmortem and come back and say well

00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:31,040
okay like what actually happened and

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,280
like where's the data now and can we

00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,920
actually like compare and diff

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,960
the data and the logic at different

00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,400
points in time

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,160
and understand the impact of our

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,240
decision and i think that's going to be

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,920
really fun to see that next evolution of

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,240
the notebook to support that

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,960
because that's the practical aspect of

00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,040
like

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,559
you know using the viz to have some

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
insight and then making a decision out

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,720
of it

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,799
and we want to have that over time

00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,559
that's how we learn

00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,119
is to be able to go back and and and

00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,119
look at that

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,680
yeah absolutely um retaining those sort

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,480
of

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,240
snapshots um like you say sort of the

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,119
intermediate phases like i have data

00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,079
that comes in

00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,960
i've made some changes uh to how i

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,559
display it

00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,000
but then i want to be able to like refer

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,880
back to like you know what was

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,760
i thinking at this point in time um is

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,280
is something that

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,240
uh that i think is not a solved thing in

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,680
in notebooks and

00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,000
i'm really curious about sort of how

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,760
that ux is is going to evolve

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,040
i don't know amelia you've you've done

00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,079
like a ton more with

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,960
with observable uh than i have and with

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,280
notebooks

00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,440
i'm curious sort of you know as you sort

00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,119
of spike out things

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,640
how do you look back and and refer to um

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,720
you know like oh this was an interesting

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,960
state or maybe it's not the whole

00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,559
solution that i want but like there's

00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,160
one aspect of this that i like

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,839
how do you then like track and like

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,920
refer back to it is it just like

00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,760
i'm gonna clone fork the notebook and

00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,079
then just i end up with like fork a fork

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,119
of fork

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,920
a fork of one um

00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,799
forks yeah um so there's two things that

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,000
i really like here

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:10,240
there's um history as seeing

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,319
it at different points in time but

00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,960
there's also history as a fallback

00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,880
mechanism

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,160
so like one of the principles of a good

00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,920
ui is

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,280
the ability to make mistakes because

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,160
then you're not afraid of changing

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,720
things so

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,559
that's another really awesome benefit of

00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,559
keeping the history so you're like

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,319
oh maybe it should be this way and then

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,079
maybe that direction doesn't work out

00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,599
you can always go back

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,359
um and then forking i think is really

00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,920
good because

00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,839
i see database as neither an art nor a

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,480
science which i think melody you hit on

00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,359
earlier

00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,440
there's no one right answer it's more

00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,280
would this help answer our question or

00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,920
if we did it in this other format

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,720
uh would that make this one point more

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,119
clear

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,079
so forking really gives you the ability

00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,480
to build out the

00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,160
like basic like data processing and data

00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,359
structure and then like try out

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,240
different variations

00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,119
and then load them up side by side and

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,680
see

00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,119
like experientially which one feels

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,319
better

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,040
which i don't think anyone knows like no

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,240
longer

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,680
no matter how long you've been a

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,240
database practitioner you don't know

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,520
which one

00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,520
is going to turn out better because

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,880
every data set is different so

00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,160
that's something that's really important

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,160
especially with database

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,160
i absolutely agree with that

00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,520
and i think that's what makes it fun

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,520
honestly like you

00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,920
there's so many different paths that you

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:41,280
can explore and i i think it i think it

00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,280
is fun to do that together

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,240
uh we're at time i i still have a couple

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,480
of

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,000
of uh questions from the audience maybe

00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,359
you can give us quick

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,760
quick uh some quick insights um melody

00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:57,760
one of the questions that um folks asked

00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,160
is

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,599
jess martin asked what would it take for

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,400
observable notebooks

00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,240
to be deployed as part of a production

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,520
environment where's the line

00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:11,040
between observable and uh something like

00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,079
a pass for instance something like

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,280
heroku

00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:17,280
um uh or maybe sort of the more modern

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,359
analogs like for cell and nullify

00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,440
like where where does observable sit in

00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,599
in sort of the spectrum of things

00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,440
yeah that's i mean there's there's a lot

00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,760
of aspects of that so we're uh

00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,880
we're sas you know software as a service

00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,160
company um

00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,280
we have uh folks in the community that

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,480
will build

00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,359
you know web apps um in observable

00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,880
and then they'll embed them elsewhere uh

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,520
we have a lot of data journalists

00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,240
teams that do that they do the data vis

00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,599
and then they just

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:50,880
embed it in you know their um their new

00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,520
site uh and so i think there's a lot

00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,319
one of the interesting aspects that we

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,920
think a lot about

00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,200
is that there's a lot of expressiveness

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,480
there's a lot that you can do in

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,359
observable

00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,359
and uh you know there's some community

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,280
members that are pushing them i mean

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,760
very creative pushing the boundaries of

01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,960
that uh in terms of

01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,599
uh serverless notebooks and uh writing

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,720
web apps and doing all sorts of things

01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,440
uh and i know that on on on the platform

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,200
side there's

01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,559
there's more work that we need to do to

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,280
support that

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,760
and i think we're trying to really

01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,880
listen

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,280
to what the community is doing and

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,319
how we can have a positive impact and

01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,359
right now that's

01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,520
a lot of it has to do with database and

01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,200
data exploration and i think there's a

01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,319
lot of applications around

01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,160
um you know deploying to point notebooks

01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,520
in production that i think will be fun

01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,440
to see over time and

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,799
i'll be really interested to to talk

01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,319
about how we support that in the

01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,520
community

01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:54,799
um so yeah

01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
okay and uh another question from paulo

01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,480
kayak

01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,000
is there any plan to let observable

01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,920
users code in other languages that

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,119
compile to javascript like typescript or

01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,200
closure script

01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,400
um i think that's a that's something

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,799
that's very

01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,079
very popular sort of theme i'm sure

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,400
you're tired of the typescript

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,079
question by now no i mean i think you

01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,960
know we're really committed to

01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,200
to javascript and also like we want to

01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:22,480
meet people where they are in database

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:26,319
so it you know i think um

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,440
uh you know language preference

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,119
and uh applicability of language for the

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,400
task that you're trying to get done with

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,680
the frameworks that you're doing it's

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,079
really important to pay attention to

01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,240
that

01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,839
because the i think we have to plan for

01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,280
the ecosystem and the frameworks to

01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:42,799
change over time

01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,880
uh and to evolve and we wanna you know

01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,559
we wanna just like we're agnostic from

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,520
the visualization framework or the web

01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,359
library that

01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,040
that you may need to use at the task i

01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,760
want observable to be a place that

01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,319
really

01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,599
integrates and supports uh what makes

01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:58,160
you productive

01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,440
so um yeah i mean i think we'll we'll

01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,319
keep paying attention we'll keep

01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,640
listening

01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,559
uh we'll be open we're pretty committed

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,839
to javascript right now but

01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:07,839
um yeah

01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,680
yeah yeah okay i see a response well

01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:16,640
typescript is javascript but yeah i

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,440
i hear you yeah yeah extremely helpful

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,160
inference it's

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,000
it's true i mean helpful if if i think

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,920
about you know what do i want

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,599
in a notebook kind of it's i i want the

01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,319
notebook to auto-complete everything for

01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,440
me and

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:29,359
there's something very nice about

01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,760
working in typescript code bases where

01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:32,720
yeah like i type two or three characters

01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,960
and then

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,720
bam that's it the editor does the rest
