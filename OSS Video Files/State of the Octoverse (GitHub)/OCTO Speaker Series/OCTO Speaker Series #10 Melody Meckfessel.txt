	How Visualization Is Changing How We Work With Data

The rising complexity of modern software and data is pushing the limits of human understanding. While open source collaboration is connecting millions of developers and collaborators, we need new ways to explore data and make better decisions. Data visualization is changing how we understand and sharing insights about the world.

Melody is a hands-on leader with decades in engineering at both startups and enterprises. Prior to Observable, she was a VP of Engineering at Google.
