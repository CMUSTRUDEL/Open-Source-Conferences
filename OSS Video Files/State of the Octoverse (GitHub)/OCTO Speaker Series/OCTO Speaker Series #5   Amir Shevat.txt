00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
hello everybody

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,600
i'm jason warner i'm the cto of github

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,439
and we started a series a speaker series

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
that we hoped would highlight the future

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
of software

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
and we wanted to shine a light on people

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,199
building the future software and what

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280
their views of it might be

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
and we wanted to learn from those people

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
about things that they

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
care about things that they are seeing

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,960
and things that they're doing

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,640
and today i'm very excited to invite one

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
of those speakers here

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
and we at github view that we have a a

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,520
very important role to play in the

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
future of software

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
though we know that others are building

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,480
on us on github

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,640
with us and around us to do that as well

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,640
and as more and more businesses and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,879
companies face developers

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
directly we think it's incredibly

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
important that a lot more people in the

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
world understand

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,640
how to build communities and

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
relationships with developers

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,479
so it's with that that i'm incredibly

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,040
excited to have

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,960
amir on with us today and because he's

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
been at the heart of developer platforms

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
and developing

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
communities and interfaces with

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,720
developers for years

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,360
amir ran devrel programs globally at

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
google

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
which obviously is a mix of both

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,880
business and technology and the way it's

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
focused on developers and platforms

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
he then went to slack before it was

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,960
obviously

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,840
a kind of developer platform that people

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
can build

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,520
upon and the obviousness

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,399
is a direct result of the work that he

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,960
did he literally wrote the book

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
twice on building conversational bots

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
and about apis

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
that developers love to use and then he

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,680
turned around and did it all again

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,240
as the vp of developer experience at

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
twitch which has grown from its gaming

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
roots into a live video platform for all

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
kinds of purposes

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
and then on i'll let him tell you about

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
his new thing reshuffle

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
which is an integration platform for you

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,000
guessed it developers

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
so i think you'll enjoy this one um and

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,040

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
for having me so much

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,800
um okay it's going to be the obligatory

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,680

um so hi everyone my name is amir

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,319
shavats very excited to have you all

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
i'm going to talk about building

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,680
developer communities and how do you

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
engage developer communities

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,720
and about the profession of developer

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,800
relations

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,480
so if you have a startup a platform or

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
even an open source project

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
and you want to engage with the with

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,519
developers i hope this session will be

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,400
uh useful for you um

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
a little bit about myself so today i'm

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
i'm a one-trick pony

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
for the last 20 years i've been only

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,599
doing developer platforms

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,000
engaging with developers building

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
developer tools

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,440
and today i'm a co-founder and

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
product and chief product officer of

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,440
reshuffle.com

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,239
reshuffle.com is an open source um

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
platform

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,400
that lets you uh create integrations

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
uh within your organizations so with if

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
you want to connect

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,959
uh your jira with your git uh

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
with your sales force and create this

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
awesome integration and you want to run

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
it

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,480
locally and you want to use open source

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
then reshuffle is probably the right

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,680
solution for you

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,120
um i started about 20 years ago

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,480
in microsoft i worked with developers on

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
windows workflow

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,840
i worked with developers on.net

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,840
when java people still said net not yet

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
it was it was a great experience my job

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,480
was to work with

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,720
startups to help them work on

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,239
the microsoft platform so i was a

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,920
developer advocate

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,159
um then i joined google at google i

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
started developer relations

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,720
for israel and then grew

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,239
and created programs such as the startup

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,919
program for google

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,240
and also the developer experts the

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,919
community of experts that go and speak

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
around the world the ambassador program

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,880
for google

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,040
i also created campus um in israel which

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,840
is a physical space where developers

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
could come and could work with googlers

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,560
um

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,440
it was a lot of fun and at the end of my

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
time google

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,919
i manage all of google's scalable

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
developer relations programs some of

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,840
which i'm going to talk about today so

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
google developer groups women and

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,120
technology my team manage

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,880
the startup program and the experts

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
program and also the isb

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,800
people who are building uh things on top

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,800
of google technologies for money

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
then i joined slack i joined slack when

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
we were about

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,520
90 people um it was two months before we

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
launched the the platform we

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,600
launched the our set of in apis and

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,560
marketplace

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,759
um and we had 50 developers on our beta

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,080
and we had 80 people in the company and

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,039
i left two years later when we had about

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,160
1500 people in the company and we had

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
000 weekly active developers on our

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,080
platform

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,000
so that wasn't a crazy expense and i'll

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
share some of the insights uh here

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
with you and if you don't know the

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
correlation if you if you're mixing your

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
correlation with your causation

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
you'd say that i pick companies based on

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
the colors of their logo

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,320
that is not true and this breaks the the

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,919
chain here um

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,560
so then i um joined amazon uh to be the

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
viva developer platform for a company

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
that acquired called twitch

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,440
um and my job there was to connect

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
between

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,400
uh twitch and and game developers

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,280
so ea and blizzard and riot um and

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
ubisoft

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
and uh streamlabs and stream elements

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,039
and all these developers

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,960
that are building on the twitch platform

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
it's where i feel like kind of meta that

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
we're

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,360
now streaming this on twitch um

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
it's kind of fun um and because this is

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
not

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,919
a lot i also wrote um two books one of

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,560
them is on

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
designing bots building conversational

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,319
interfaces so how

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
can you as a developer or as a startup

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
uh build

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,720
interfaces such as um slack bots

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,039
or facebook whatsapp bots uh or twilio

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,479
bots or any type of

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,520
software where you can talk to your

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,840
software or text your software instead

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,440
of

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,599
pressed buttons and stuff like that okay

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
and then another book that i wrote is

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,039
designing uh

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,960
together with two engineers from slack

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,919
is designing web apis

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,199
this is all about building apis that uh

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,080
developers

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,280
love and we talk about how to design

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,919
different apis

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,440
but also about how to create an

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,440
ecosystem around your api

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
so um let's start with why do you want a

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,160
developer community

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,800
and i'm going to be controversial here

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,800
and say you probably

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,479
there's a very high percentage that you

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
that you don't really need a developer

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,759
community

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,080
um and if you if you just think that you

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
need a developer community think again

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
many companies think that they need a

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,800
community at all but they actually need

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
a different go-to-market or a different

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,720
type of engagement

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,120
um building a community is expensive

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,759
building community requires people

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
especially when they're developers um it

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,919
requires people who are developers

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,800
so for example anyone who works in my

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
team uh had to be a developer itself

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
meaning they would be an expensive

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,560
person because

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,560
developers are uh kind of expensive um

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,599
they're also not contributing core

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
code to your um to your product um and

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,759
if they do it's not their

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
main job so that means that they're they

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
don't give you the return that

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,919
developers um usually make so if you

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,599
don't need a developer relations and if

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,240
you don't need a developer ecosystem

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,879
i strongly recommend not pursuing that

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
there

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
there is though a lot of power in the

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,360
developer community

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,719
there are situations where a developer

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,279
community are the make

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,080
or break of your company or your product

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,120
um and

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,360
um and once you realize that power

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
it bring it actually becomes a core

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
tenant of your company

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
uh in a core tenant of your product to

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,920
have an ecosystem of developers

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,320
on top of that um and here's uh three

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,760
examples of developer communities that i

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,600
ran into um the first one is developer

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
as core contributors

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
these are people who are actually

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
working for your uh

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,320
for your code um especially in open

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,800
source this is

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
uh pretty common but you have an open

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,720
source project

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,480
and developers are actually excited and

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,080
want to contribute code

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,760
an example would be linux here the the

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
challenge with this developer community

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
is all about governance

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
how do you define the processes of

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,240
building

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
the code how do you create a good pr how

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,360
do you decide whether

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,240
pr comes in or not who gets to reject

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
features i'm not gonna talk about that

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,959
but if

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,440
you want uh please reach out to me and

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,519
i'll i'm i'll be happy to create a con

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
a presentation about managing open

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
source uh object

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,240
governance of community i'm gonna focus

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
on the two

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,600
second types of communities um

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,720
developers are

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,519
as customers so you have a product

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
and your developers are actually your

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,680
customers they're using the product

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
uh they might be even paying for the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,519
product um

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
a good example would be uh stripe uh or

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,519
twilio where you actually

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160
as a twilio um as a developer using

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
twilio

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,160
um it's really easy for me to understand

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,240
that i'm the customer

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,480
and i'm actually paying for api calls

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
and another type of developer that we're

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
going to cover is

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,839
um partner ecosystem that means that i

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,160
have a product

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,040
and developers come and build on my

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,680
platform

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,120
in order to make my platform better in

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,720
order for them it's order to be

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,560
successful on my platform

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,839
and for me it's owner in order to make

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,959
my platform better

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
so when i worked at android um android

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,640
would not be very useful

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
if we didn't have a developer community

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,760
if we didn't have

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,000
uber and spotify and all the awesome

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,480
and games of course and all the awesome

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,360
um i play hearthstone every day and that

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
that is the core of my my phone because

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
i love

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,079
playing um so you have something like a

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
platform

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,640
uh like android or ios and you want

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
developers to build on top of that

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
platform

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
and make that uh platform much more

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
valuable

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,079
um then then you need to build an

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,680
ecosystem

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,560
around around your product

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,399
at slack we had a very similar thing we

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,519
were integrating into a lot

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,560
of um we actually started with auto

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,880
developer relations

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,800
we were we built our first 64

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,720
integrations ourselves

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,000
um and then we found out that it's

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
really really hard

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
and customers were asking for so many

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,920
other integrations

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
into so many other tools um so we

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
decided to

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,079
actually open a platform as a result of

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
not

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,760
not being able to do it ourselves and

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
then we

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,200
we created this platform and we

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,639
created this amazing value for our

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
customers

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,320
by integrating into all the tools and

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,760
services that they had

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,800
um and today um the top

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
uh i when i left the top to reap and i'm

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,560
sure it's still the today the top

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,519
uh three top one of the top three

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,560
reasons

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,519
for people loving the product is that it

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,800
integrates into one of their tools

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,240
so it could bring a lot of value

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,000
for your platform okay

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,680
so we talked about why why should you um

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
do develop relations or developer

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,480
community let's talk a little bit about

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
the how

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,680
how would you um go about and create a

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,720
developer ecosystem

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,519
so this is basically my um

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,800
framework for thinking about engaging

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,519
with developers

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,639
you need to inspire them inspire them is

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
teaching them why

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,000
why should they use why should they care

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,560
about your other platform or sdk

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,079
or open source project why is it

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,399
important for them

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,079
that's what i call the weapon what's in

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,560
it for me

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,160
then and you do that and what about how

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
to do that you do that by

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
doing outreach uh and doing a lot of

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
inspirational

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,959
uh content um then you need to educate

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,240
about

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,360
educate them about the how um

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,399
how should they build um

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,920
and and what should they build

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,079
what are the things that you want them

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
to build a lot of a common mistake that

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,480
i see

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,399
with platforms is that they're not

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,560
opinionated they say hey

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,399
here's an api do whatever you want with

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,200
it uh and i think that that

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
initially is a mistake because you need

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
to shape

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,279
examples of what is a good um

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,199
use case um of the platform an api

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
then you need to enable them you need to

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,560
give them tools and services

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
to be successful examples for that would

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,880
be

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,320
give them an sdk give them a debugger

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,839
give them something that captures logs

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
give them an ability to program in their

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,199
own language

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
these are all capabilities that enable

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,959
developers

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,839
once they are inspired and educated to

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,639
actually

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,040
develop on your on your platform or use

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,920
your sdk

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,880
then there's the most important part in

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,399
this model

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,519
which is often um not uh taking into

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
account which is

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,800
uh feedback i think this is the most

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,279
important part of developer outreach

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,519
developers are awesome because they tell

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,120
you when your product is broken

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,360
they're opinionated and they're positive

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,199
and from my experience they tell you

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
what you need to build in order to make

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,720
them successful

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
capturing that feedback and feeding it

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
back to product

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,120
is the most important thing that you can

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
do because that is

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,120
a collaborative experience that you

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,839
could do with your community

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
i'm a strong believer that community

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
building

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,199
and leadership starts with participation

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,360
if you don't belong to the community

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,399
you can't lead the community and the

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
feedback loop

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
helps you capture that goodness that the

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,680
community is telling you

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,839
if your product or service or api is

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,240
working for them or not and feeding it

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,519
back to the product team

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,079
and we can talk more about it later

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
this is another way to look at at the

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,639
developer outreach

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
which is through a funnel

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
for those of you who don't know what a

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
funnel is it's a it's a common term in

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,680
marketing

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,560
where you um let's say you land on

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,040
amazon

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,160
and then you choose a shoe and then you

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
choose a

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,639
blue shoe and a running shoe and then

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,720
you choose your size and then you click

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,160
and put your credit card in and then you

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,519
buy um

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,920
with this each step of this um

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,320
this process less and less people go

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,759
through so let's say 10 000 go uh to

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
amazon every second

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,079
and only three buy every second so it

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,959
looks like a funnel

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,120
uh from a process perspective um another

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,360
way of looking at developer ecosystems

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,399
is through a developer funnel so how

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
many developers

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,440
are interested in your product how many

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
of them are

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,160
actually building on your api um how

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
many of them have published on your

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,800
marketplace so

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,720
one of the metrics that measured

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
ourselves in slack is how many published

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,120
apps do we have

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,079
um from these apps how many are actually

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,040
being used

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,079
um a lot of people publish things um but

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,120
nobody uses them

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,040
i've had experiences like that

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,800
both in twitch and in slack and in

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,199
android um

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
and so measuring the usage and

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,480
usefulness

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,600
of the things that people buy and build

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,959
on your platform

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,160
um is important and last but not least

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,000
are people making money um that's that's

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,199
an interesting uh mechanism because it

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
moves uh

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,800
people from i'm a hobbyist using your

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
product or platform

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,079
to uh this is my business this is my

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,079
core thing

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,440
um and one of the things that stored uh

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
butterfield the ceo

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
slack told me when i joined uh which

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,120
blew my mind

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,160
was i want the next slack to be built on

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
slack

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
which is um he wanted someone to build a

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,199
business that is as

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,319
successful as slack on top of the slack

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,520
platform

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,120
so now that and by the way this funnel

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,919
could be different for different

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,600
uh ecosystems so your funnel might not

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,640
finish in market monetization

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,640
it could finish in uh usage or it could

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,679
finish in something completely different

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,120
um your funnel could look the steps of

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
the funnel could look different

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
but usually you would have the same type

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,760
of funnel for your developers

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,960
and now you need to do two things on the

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,440
one side

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,600
you need to write the metric that

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,240
measures that step of the funnel

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,120
so for interested uh for example for

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,440
reshuffle

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,679
is how many people learn land on

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,240
dev.reshuffle.com

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,679
that for me is the the metric for

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
interested

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
building is uh people using the the git

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,840
repository for

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,679
uh reshuffle.com publishing we don't

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
have that metric but we have like people

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
who engage in with us and ask for a demo

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,400
then usage

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,880
and then monetization so you need to

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
write a metric that is associated with

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
each step of the funnel so you can

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
actually

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,720
measure it and on the other side of the

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
funnel

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
you need to write the activities that

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,039
you think will move the needle

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,799
what are the things that you could do in

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,840
order to get me people to be

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,960
interested in the product um speaking

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,080
in events is one uh writing writing

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,240
articles is another um doing

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
an ad campaign it could be another one

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,559
so what are the actions that you can

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,960
take

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,080
in order to move developers through that

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,480
funnel

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
and now you need to actually take those

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
actions

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,960
and measure the impact on the on the

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,760
step

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,039
so i run a um a google campaign or a

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,360
facebook campaign

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,360
and i get people to land on my landing

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,200
page how effective is this

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
is this actually moving the needle are

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,080
people converting into building

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,160
am i capturing the right users um so

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,160
that's that's another way of looking at

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
the developer funnel and i would say

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
mix and match those in order to see that

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,960
you're actually

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,200
doing the right thing now

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
let's talk a little bit about um

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,880
developer relations

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,600
as an organization how do you um how do

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,400
you build a developer relations team

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,320
so these are more or less the big parts

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,080
of developer relations

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,360
um organizations there's an advocacy

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,360
team

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,559
they do the one-to-many they do

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,919
activities that have broad reach uh they

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
speak in events

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,240
they run communities they are an

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,720
ambassadors of third-party communities

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,679
and i'll talk about that later

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
their job is to inspire and educate

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,360
developers

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
at large um they do the all the

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,280
activities

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
that are scalable similar to that you

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
have the

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,440
the content uh writers content writers

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,200
um

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,120
do not usually do not go and speak in

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,919
events but they write the

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,919
tutorials the one-on-ones um they write

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
the dev site so if you have a developer

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
landing page

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
and you have tutorials there and you

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,000
have

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,000
javadoc for example they would um

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
they would create those documentations

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,159
and write content

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
that ins that inspire but most mostly

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,919
educate

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,960
and enable developers uh to use your

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,440
platform so

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
that is uh breath engagement on the on

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
the

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,919
on the one hand side um on the other

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
hand side

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,720
you have the depth engagement this is

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,080
the one to few or one to one

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,159
um for example uh partner engineering

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,520
uh sometimes in amazon it was called

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,679
solution engineer

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
these are people who go uh solution

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
architect actually

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,480
uh these are people who go and work with

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,679
top partners

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,799
um on creating amazing engagements um so

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,360
for example i think

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
someone in this channel in this stream

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,120
is called john again i had

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
the pleasure of working with him and he

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
managed the

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
partner partnership engineering at slack

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,760
and his job was

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,440
to work with companies like uh google

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,240
like salesforce like

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
um small startups uh that were that shot

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,919
of potential

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
uh and create amazing integrations

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,559
between

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,000
those companies and um

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,159
and slack so um their job was to work

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,240
with selected set of partners

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
in order to create what we called

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,760
lighthouse wins how can you create

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,400
winds that inspire developers to

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,640
uh work with us and bring a lot of value

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,000
to our customers

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,400
last last organization that i've seen is

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,679
enterprise architects um these are

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
people who work with

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,080
customers big customers um that use

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
uh your platform and help them um

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,480
integrate into that platform

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,280
um you can look at them as kind of a

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,039
success

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,120
um engineers for developers um

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,400
their job is to make customers who have

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,559
already bought the product

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
be very successful on the on the

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,559
platform

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
um and um they're very valuable for so

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,600
for example at slack

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,640
we had uh when ibm um bought slack

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,159
we had this team work with them in order

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,280
to integrate and create

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:42,559
uh usage of our platform inside ibm

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,600
okay so we talked about um how to do

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,159
a developer relations and what's the um

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,640
what is the structure of uh of a of a

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,120
good

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,120
developer relations organization um i

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,360
want to deep dive into communities

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,200
because that's a very common

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
activity that you do inside developer

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
relations and i want to take you through

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,960
three examples

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
of building communities and how you

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
create

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,120
how we created uh communities in

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,400
different

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,679
uh places in microsoft at

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,080
um at google and at slack

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,520
and then we can explore uh what are the

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,360
differences between those

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,880
uh type of activities because building

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
communities is not the same

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,240
in everywhere you go so the first

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
use case is when i was working at

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,640
microsoft this was about

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
um about 15 years ago and we had

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,640
something called

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,640
the microsoft roundtables or it was also

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,000
called the cto roundtable

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,720
in many other places um this was

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,360
um a community engagement that was high

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
touch

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
meaning that we actually uh curated the

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
people

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
that came to the community we selected

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,279
them you had to pay

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,799
to be a part of the community um it was

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,159
fde like

00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,880
full-time employee manage the community

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,320
um they were they created the content

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,600
they gathered the people

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,840
the events were in microsoft offices

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,360
um and it was very roi driven what we

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,279
did is we collected

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,360
the ctos and cios of the companies

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
who had enterprise agreements who were

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,960
paying more than

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,559
a hundred thousand dollars to microsoft

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
we collected them together

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,320
and created a community out of them and

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,919
we gave them a lot of

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,320
high quality content in order to uh work

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,559
with us and we what we saw is that

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
working between themselves helped us a

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,159
lot

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,240
with um convincing them of the value of

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,559
that microsoft brought to their business

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,360
uh because they talked to each other and

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
they talked about

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,720
what was successful and what was not

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,760
successful and that

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,720
provided a lot of value so it was high

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,400
touch we ran this

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,679
all over um europe and the u.s and um

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,919
major places in asia and um

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,520
it was very very successful because it

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,600
was very focused

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,440
on high quality high touch and scalable

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
it was it was pretty expensive because

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,200
we paid for everything we pre we paid

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,159
for the location we paid for the content

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,440
we paid for

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,080
um everything um but it was tied into

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,840
roi

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
you couldn't get into that community if

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,159
you didn't pay us

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
um so we saw a direct correlation

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,640
between

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
uh causation between joining the

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,440
community um

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and being a paying customer so that was

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,440
a high

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,400
touch high quality scalable

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,679
uh and expensive but when it was tied

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
into monetization

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:41,039
it was um the roi the return on

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,559
investment was pretty high

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,880
then there was the google developer

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,400
group um

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
when i joined it was already very

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,200
successful and i i hope i helped making

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
it

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,440
slightly better um it was a great

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,240
success

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,880
uh and it still is a great success um

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,520
there are more than

00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,640
750 um google developer groups

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,200
um that prior to corona met

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
in person now i guess they're meeting

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,240
online

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,320
every month so every month people

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
volunteered by the way this is volunteer

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
led people met

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,919
each other for free to talk about the

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,039
google technologies

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,559
now think about your api or company

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,279
think about 750 uh meetups

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,760
from around the world that meet on a

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,960
monthly basis to talk about your api or

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
platform isn't that

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,000
mind-blowing and it was led by

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,200
volunteers who were doing that for free

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,400
and we had places like madagascar

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,480
and even people were fighting over uh

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,760
who's gonna be the google developer lead

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,799
for certain um

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,679
hot places so it was super active these

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,000
people

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,360
were amazing they every time we released

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,679
a new api

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
or a new version of android they would

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,840
go and

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,039
and and get us get content and create

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,360
content and

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,159
capture speak get speakers to speak

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,799
about this new and exciting apis or

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,159
our platform um so it was a it was a

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,200
great experience

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,360
um highly scalable

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
not very expensive so we had about five

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
people managing

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,279
all of the engagement around the world

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,840
we still sent swag and we had it was

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,240
still

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,200
um expensive in terms of like a startup

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,760
but in terms of

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
um the previous engagement that i talked

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,080
to in microsoft

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,120
this was peanuts um and it was highly

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
scalable

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,799
and we were very happy with it we didn't

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,279
tie it to monetization because

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,600
um android is free we tied it more

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,399
towards awareness and proficiency

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
um but it didn't come without problems

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,440
um

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
i went and we had a problem one of our

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,399
um

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
biggest communities i think it was in

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,880
brazil and i went to visit there

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,360
um and i came in and there were a lot of

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
people

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
and i started talking to them to see hey

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,880
what are you developing your development

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,600
an android or a chrome

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,440
and a lot of them were saying no i'm not

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,559
a developer i'm just here

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,080
um because i love google and there's

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,440
good food in the meetups

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,480
and smart people um and this problem is

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,520
what i call

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,159
uh cookie eaters um sometimes if you

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
have

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,159
um a community uh you have people that

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,039
are that

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,080
are not are not actually the core

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,320
audience that you want

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
in that community uh you have a

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,679
developer community

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,919
and some sometimes people come just for

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,320
the brand or just for the cookies

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,440
or just for there's an event and they're

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,640
bored

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,360
and if you have too many of those it

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,840
dilutes

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,440
your community so because developers

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,039
when they come to a meet up their

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,919
expectation is to work with other

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,840
developers

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,360
and if they meet a lot of other people

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
who are not developers for example

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,720
they're all in marketing

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,120
they don't really want to to be in that

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,360
meetup anymore and and that creates um

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,159
satisfaction problems and also content

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,159
becomes

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,320
pretty watered down because people don't

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,080
want to talk about hardcore things

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,840
so what we actually had to do is um take

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
a surgical approach there

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,000
and create a lot of good content work

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,399
with the community leader there

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
in order to create very strong content

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,039
and um

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,080
and focus on making sure that only

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
developers and high high value

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,559
developers

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,640
belong to that to that group

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,279
so my learnings there is that you can do

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,480
you need to measure the quality but you

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,159
can do high-touch

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,880
and scalable way of doing community

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,720
it's much less expensive it requires a

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
lot of coordination and love and

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,279
fostering of this highly scalable

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,480
community

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,720
and you need to make sure that you

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,720
always foster it um making sure that

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
there's not too many cookie eaters make

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,760
sure that

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
uh your community leaders have a

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,960
succession

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,799
uh plan sometimes community leaders are

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
get tired and don't want to manage your

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,640
community anymore

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,720
so making sure that you have um a junior

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,520
community leader who's willing to take

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,559
a throne once the major community leader

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
wants to leave

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,919
is another um another best practice

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,760
there

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,960
and the impact that you want to measure

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,240
with scale

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,080
is awareness these communities created

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
a lot of awareness for the google

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,600
products

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,480
the last case i want to talk about is

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,080
the slack community strategy which is

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,520
kind of interesting because

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,399
what we what we did there is um

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,279
we didn't have a budget for community uh

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,360
we had

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,200
amazing partner engineers and we had

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,039
amazing content creators

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,559
and we had great advocates and

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,640
we just didn't have the budget for a

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,960
community uh my budget

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
um initially first year i think was

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
about five thousand dollars for

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,320
everything um and community is an

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,440
expensive thing

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,559
um so we decided to instead of

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,799
um building our own community we decided

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,159
to hack into other communities

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,240
um so what we did is we went into um

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,960
customers like people who were working

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,440
with slack like ibm and said hey ibm

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
would do you want to promote watson

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,000
which is your ai

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,440
we want to promote the slack api

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,200
why don't we build a workshop that says

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,039
build a slack bot with watson

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,559
and they said yeah that sounds like a

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,960
great idea and then

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,919
let's go and talk about it to our

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,760
community to the ibm developer community

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,360
and then we did the same thing with uh

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
with google and with amazon and we said

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,240
like

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,279
and these are all third-party images um

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,640
of them

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:55,200
uh engaging with the community um um

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
on top of the slack platform so um we

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,799
went to

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,559
um amazon and we said hey you want to

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,440
promote lambda

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,840
we want to promote uh slack integrations

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,799
let's

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
talk about using lamda to build slack

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,600
integrations

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
um and they said yeah that's a great

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,080
idea we just read about you in

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,279
techcrunch you're a small

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,720
sexy startup let's do that um and

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,000
all of them were very happy to give us

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,840
uh access to their community because

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,320
first of all we found what's in it for

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,679
them and a good value proposition for

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,840
the partner

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,559
we also um were like the sexy new kid in

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,519
town

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,200
and it was uh very obvious for them that

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,080
that will generate more love for

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,600
for their platform so always build build

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,440
a win-win-win situation

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,880
but you don't need to create your own

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,760
community you can

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,799
really easily engage with third-party

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,679
communities

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,880
that are interested in your product uh

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,799
without

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,399
seeding and creating your own community

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,919
and a community is something that could

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,799
evolve later on

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,399
right now slack has a thriving developer

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,559
community that i'm very proud of

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,080
and the team has done an amazing job but

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,480
in the first year we just didn't have

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,360
the money to do that so we had to hack

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,919
into other

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,000
uh developer communities so the the

00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,240
learnings there is that um

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,760
you can do high quality high touch and

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,399
scalable content

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,960
but it needs to be um but you need to

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,279
have

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,519
uh a buy-in into into the platform you

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,760
either need to be sexy or very valuable

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,399
uh or um the new the the new shiny thing

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,200
um usually building value is more

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,080
important than

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
um than the other things and if if you

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,600
talk to a community leader

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,960
and you bring value to their community

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,480
they will give you an into their

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
community because that's all what

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,799
we're trying to do is to prove to

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,840
provide value to our communities

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,399
um and use partners

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,919
choose wisely make sure that you choose

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,960
the right partner

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,200
and the impact that we saw is pure

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,399
integrations people were using

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,320
um lambda to build slack bots

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,240
our partners measured that as well

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,520
people were using watson to build

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:14,240
um building stack bots again

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,000
integration measured uh um an impact

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,760
which brings me to the last topic i'm

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
gonna spend like two minutes talking

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,200
about

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,839
um measuring things and measuring the

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,320
right things

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,839
because one of the key problems with

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,399
developer relations is that

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,760
you can do a lot of activities without

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,040
actually moving the

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,399
needle or moving the wrong needle

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,200
let's look at um three um

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,679
bad examples and two uh examples that i

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,679
think

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,839
make more sense um so the first one is

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,560
on the bottom end is developers engaged

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,720
sometimes called developers touched so

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,280
how many developers how many eyeballs

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,839
did you capture how many people did you

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,960
touch basically i know coved you don't

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,640
touch people

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,960
especially not random people but um

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,880
this was a measurement that we used at

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,400
google and also at microsoft so how many

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,760
people did i talk to

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,240
i think this is not a very good um

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
type of metric because first of all you

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,200
can have a bad impression on the person

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,440
that you touch you can

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,119
talk about a product and do a very bad

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,079
job very poor job and nobody wants to

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,720
use the product you

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,920
actually talk to 10 000 people but

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,920
nobody cared

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
um another thing is that it's not a

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,800
directly valuable

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,760
thing for the company even if developers

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,680
are engaged

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,400
they might not take an action that is

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,640
important to the company

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
then there's developer registered i

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,000
don't like developer register because i

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,960
think that you can move people to

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,599
to do to register just by doing good

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,320
hacking

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,920
of like facebook and google and a good

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,640
landing page you would get people to

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,320
register

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,839
but that's the last activity that they

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,320
will do um

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,880
especially um if like if you're great in

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,280
marketing

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,440
and ui you can you can get people to do

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,320
the registration but actually usage

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,280
is much harder um the last one that i

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,760
don't really like

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,040
is revenue to the company i think it's

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,240
indirect it's also

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,920
screws up incentives um

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,560
and i'll give you an example i i was

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,520
working at microsoft as a developer

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,599
advocate

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,839
um and then there was a debate about

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,800
whether developer advocate should have

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,280
uh quotas and i was really against that

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
because

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,760
i felt that that will turn me into a

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,839
salesperson the minute i have a quota

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,440
i would start stop thinking about what's

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,680
good for the developer and what's good

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,680
for the ecosystem with my community

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,200
and i would start thinking about how can

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,359
i get people to pay

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,040
and that's a very different way of

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,880
thinking than develop relations develop

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,520
relations need to be advocates they need

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,200
to be

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,960
bi-directional tool that helps

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,280
the company engage with developers and

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,800
help developers engage with the company

00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,160
uh definitely not sales in my opinion

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,359
now the top two um are kind of important

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,079
the first one is a week the number of

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,240
developers with weekly active tokens

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
means that a developer has built

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,200
something on the slack platform

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
has um that

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,599
platform that a token is now being used

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
on a weekly basis

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,760
so that means that they actually went

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
through the funnel of being inspired

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,960
educated

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,720
uh hopefully gave feedback uh they're

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,160
definitely enabled because

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,320
they're they're using a token they're

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,800
using the api and that api is using

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,599
is used on the on a weekly basis that

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,240
means that they

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,200
built the entire value flow uh for the

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,160
customers

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,680
um the last one the second last one is

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,839
uh how many people

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,440
um what's the correlation this was just

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,880
like in slack we saw a very strong

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,000
correlation so about

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,760
97 of our paying customers were using

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
the platform and we talked about that at

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,200
a time

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,960
uh even publicly and that was very

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,640
important to us because we wanted to

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,720
make sure that our customers are paying

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
customers are still using the platform

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,520
on an ongoing basis or

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,560
continuing to give them value okay

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
lessons learned work on both breadth and

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,160
depth

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,720
like i showed you focus on high value

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,480
developers and partners

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,839
measure and align the right thing

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,920
advocate so be

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,000
bi-directional rather than be an

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,920
evangelist rather than like saying hey

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
praise the lord here's our api say

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
here's our api if it's broken

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,280
we're going to work with you to make it

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,440
uh better

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
um we can we can talk a little bit later

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,520
about like where in the org but like

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,119
if you're part of engineering uh or

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,920
product that's amazing

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,320
um make sure that you the the money to

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
your

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,240
um to your organization comes uh

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,680
specifically for

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,960
developer engagement um rather than like

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,200
sales for example

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,599
and always always always think about

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,520
what's in it for me for the developer

00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,800
why should they use the platform what is

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,920
the value

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,720
of the platform okay last thing which is

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
super meta

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,640
is if you want to experiment with

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,680
developer outreach

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,200
uh i highly recommend doing streaming

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,839
which is basically what we're doing now

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,800
which is super meta one of my friends uh

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,400
romaine from

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,119
uh from uh stripe um did a

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,520
set of very successful uh striped

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,720
sessions engaging with developers

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,640
um on on twitch um

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,400
visual studio does the same they have a

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,480
channel that is pretty popular

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,599
uh teaching developers how to use visual

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,079
studio so

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,920
think about new ways of streaming uh new

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,920
ways of engaging with the community

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
because right now it's kind of hard to

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,520
meet in person

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,640
but there's tons of opportunities to

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,680
engage

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,640
online and do scalable

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,200
engagements with your developers thank

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,079
you

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,079
you are awesome

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,839
okay

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,880
all right amir that was awesome thank

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,440
you so much for all that

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,720
um now we should get to the q a portion

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,720
of this

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,760
thank you it took a little bit more i

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,359
was like

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,440
talking and stuff like that because and

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,839
i noticed that the time went through

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,119
uh a little bit longer than i expected

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,560
but you know

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,480
i think everyone will enjoy the commute

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,599
the the information

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,599
um one thing we should say is in the q a

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,960
if uh we don't hit something now and if

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,079
you're watching this later

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,040
please still drop questions in there

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,680
we will be looking at the discussion

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,599
thread

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,520
throughout um time and if you have

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
something that's a very easy way

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,040
to get in touch with amir or myself or

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,240
anybody else and we could always go back

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,400
and forth on there

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,960
so um it's kind of the beauty of async

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,880
communication tools like github for this

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,640
so here thank you so much you obviously

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,079
have a ton of experience you share and i

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,920
love the stories too particularly the

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,160
cookie eater one that

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,119
those are always fun to talk about

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,119
though it's

00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,400
true but let's get into a couple of

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,760
questions here real quickly about some

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,440
of the things that you you've

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,000
experienced and seen over the years

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,200
so let's talk about a time or a place

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,560
where deveral doesn't just doesn't work

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,200
yes so i think the developer ecosystem

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,280
is a result of a product market fit

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,240
rather than the cause for a product

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,839
market fit so

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,319
you need to have a product developers

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,359
love and then build the community and

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,720
ecosystem

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,280
if you're saying hey i'm going to build

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,000
an ecosystem but my product is not that

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,760
useful then i think you don't get a lot

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,680
of value and you hit the wall

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
really really fast you try to engage

00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,720
with developers

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,720
they they are friendly because they're

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,400
friendly beings and but then they walk

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,160
away because they don't care or you're

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,160
not giving them a lot of value

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,280
so a big mistake that i see a lot of

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,960
startups is

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,400
trying to build a community because

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,520
before they reach the product

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,000
marketplace

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,200
actually develop relations is is a is a

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,640
way to

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,560
get all the people that love your

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,760
product to build value

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,440
and give them a lot of value um

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,599
and that that's a common mistake that i

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,720
see that's awesome

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,359
i think i'm going to come back to that

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,000
one in a little bit too because um

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,560
there's some some nuance inside that one

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,319
so

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,000
though let's keep going forward what are

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,880
some of the anti-patterns that you see

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,319
outside of

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
maybe bringing devrel too early when

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:26,480
they don't have product market fit

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,599
anti-patterns um turning devrel

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,480
into sales um if if you're

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,680
devrel are trying so so here's a here's

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,359
the thing with developers and i'm a

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,319
developer so i can i can say that

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,079
um if we we really loved talking to

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,160
other developers

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,680
we are okay talking to developer

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,319
relations people

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,960
we kind of shy away from marketing

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,960
people

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,640
and we run away screaming when there's a

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,240
sales person in the room

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,560
and and that's that's that that is

00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
common uh i've talked to many many

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,000
developers and got that

00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,520
if your developer relations is a

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,319
salesperson then

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,079
they won't have a lot of success um a

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,480
second anti-patent which is uh

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,599
very common is not having developer

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,160
empathy

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,520
one thing that i did when i did when i

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,000
interviewed people from my

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,000
organization is i asked them where is

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,760
the platform broken

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,680
use the platform and tell me where it's

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,000
broken and if they told me hey

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,680
everything is amazing everything is okay

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,400
that was actually a negative signal for

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,760
me

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,520
because there i don't believe that

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,480
there's a platform that doesn't have

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,280
uh places to grow and in order to be a

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,119
developer

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
relations person or to be a part of the

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,319
community you need to realize that

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,000
we we live in a work work in progress

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,960
kind of uh life as developers

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,200
we love to check our each other's pr's

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,599
we love to give feedback to code

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,040
this is part of our being if we say hey

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,200
everything is great

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,800
with with uh with something then we

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,599
probably don't have a lot of developer

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,160
empathy

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,359
so making make sure that you have people

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,040
in your organization

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,400
that know all the all the bad points all

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,240
the uh frictions

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,079
and have enough developer empathy and

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,520
understand what's good for

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,760
and what's what motivates your

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,480
developers so not having developer

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,920
empathy

00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,599
and selling uh crap that's

00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,960
one of the anti-patterns that i see all

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,480
the time is that selling

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,839
one it's i don't know where it comes

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,920
from obviously you can come from a

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,880
variety of different places

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,359
but if you're going to sell to me the

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,240
cio or the cto of an organization that's

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,160
one thing

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,319
but don't sell to the developers and

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,839
interesting you know 2020 world the

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,440
easiest way to sell to me

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,520
is to not sell to my developers but have

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,480
them still use and love your product

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,960
because then

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,760
i will automatically write a check and

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,440
exactly

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,720
but but don't sell to them snake dinners

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,000
like that don't work here you got to

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,119
find a different approach exactly

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,640
awesome um okay uh this is going to be a

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,000
combo question going back to the first

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,839
one so what about a startup

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,680
that's got one devrel person how do you

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,920
want to focus that person

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,599
how do you want to start out but then go

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,359
back to the first question which is

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,680
pre-product market fit because what if

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,760
you're a startup that

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,119
wants that developer community or thinks

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,160
the developer community is actually

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,839
critical

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,440
to long-term how do you thread the

00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,720
needle when might you know you

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,640
need that first everl person with maybe

00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,839
pre-product market fit or just close to

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,119
it like how do you think about the whole

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,400
thing there

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,079
yeah so i think at the beginning um

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,520
and that's critical stage that my

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,680
startup is right now

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,680
is figuring out product market fit in

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,920
terms of like getting a lot of feedback

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,720
so there's two roles for that first

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,359
developer

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,400
advocate um the first thing that they

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,599
need to do

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,040
is build the table stakes things all the

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,920
basic things that you need as a

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,640
developer

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
in order to land and understand and be

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,400
successful on the platform

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
and the way to measure it is called five

00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,359
minutes to hello world

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,280
and you should probably read about that

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,240
it's a it's a great metaphor and

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,280
thinking about like

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,079
i land on a landing page for an api

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
how fast can i from landing on that

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,119
landing page

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
actually use that api or platform

00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,200
successfully

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,960
how how fast can i write in a low world

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,640
on android for example

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,680
how fast can i use um a github api

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,000
and um be successful with it

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,720
so if if the time is five minutes that's

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,359
amazing

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,960
if the time is five days that's horrible

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,599
and no developers will probably spend

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,359
any time

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,119
if it's somewhere in the middle it's

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,319
something that you should probably

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,240
try to make better as time pass so

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,000
the job the person the first person is

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,880
to build the table stakes for the

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,960
developer

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,920
to be able to land on a certain

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,079
destination

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,119
understand the value proposition and

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,119
then go through

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,400
a set of steps hopefully short setup

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,800
step in order to be

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
successful so that that is the one job

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,200
of that developer

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,359
person the second one is capturing

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,240
feedback so what what we do that's like

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,359
for example

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,680
is every every thursday

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,079
we bought pizzas i used my five thousand

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,359
dollars uh budget for that we bought

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,400
pizzas and we got developers to come and

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,160
speak

00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
about their experience on the slack

00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,920
platform so that creates a lot of

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,880
empathy and understanding within the

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,680
product group

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,480
about how and what is missing in the in

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,240
the platform

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,599
and we did a lot of user research we

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,359
interviewed developers we brought

00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,720
developers to speak with the pro

00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,280
with the pms um so that's the two things

00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
make sure that as as you continue you

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,000
get developers to try

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:43,599
i actually offer uh 25 of

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,280
amazon credit initially to for people to

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,920
um play with my product play with my api

00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,520
and just give me feedback do this use

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,200
case on my platform

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,200
and give me feedback at what works and

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,400
what didn't work so um

00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,319
capturing uh that value is gold because

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,680
again as i said one thing that i love

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,720
about developers is that they're

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,800
opinionated

00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,760
and they're direct so they will tell you

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,880
what's broken

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,400
and they will tell you how to fix it i i

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,480
love the point about

00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,319
empathy through and through i talk about

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,760
this quite a bit uh publicly

00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,440
which is obviously developer empathy and

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,119
having an understanding for that and

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,559
i talk about pre-obvious and post

00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,000
obvious startups

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,319
you know there's a pre-obvious phase to

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,240
you in a post-obvious phase to you

00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,760
but more than that when it comes to the

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,200
developer empathy side of this

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,079
is the zero to one one to two moment and

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,760
i think we as a world still get this

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,440
wrong with developers we don't have the

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,599
best tools for developers

00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,480
and i i like to begrudgingly joke about

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,920
this because i

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,440
i can still feel like even if i'm at

00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,559
github and microsoft i'm punching up to

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,119
amazon

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,800
or your old employer google but

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,880
developer empathy it feels like in the

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,680
developer tools approach

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,599
at some of those larger companies they

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,359
don't actually know what goes in on a

00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,599
day in day out basis

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,480
for someone consuming all of the amazon

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,440
services in

00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,000
aggregate and what happens there um so i

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,119
think that's an

00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,920
excellent point thank you for

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,359
reinforcing that one i totally agree uh

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,520
and by the way we all

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,839
suffer from that uh when i was at google

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,880
we we had like a landing page for

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,200
uh for developers and we actually had

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,000
uh developers come and go through the

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,000
flow

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,319
and we had we watched them um in a lab

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,079
and it was shocking the experience like

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:29,760
what we thought was trivial was not

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,280
trivial so even if you're

00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,960
an enterprise and you think that you

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,640
have a great developer

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,880
platform experience always bring

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,079
developers and grow your empathy as time

00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,559
passes

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,200
awesome we have a couple of questions

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,119
around a topic around live streaming and

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,720
i'm not sure exactly

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,440
the um the intent behind this but we

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
have one in the

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,040
the discussions group and one in the

00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,599
chat so for folks who are writing yours

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,359
in the chat

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,880
feel free to go drop it in the

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,640
discussions for more

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,720
uh so we can have an active live

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,119
conversation after the stream

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,079
as well but i'm gonna read the question

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,440
i think you can read it to

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,520
me here in the comments but there's

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,359
quite a bit around stream of execution

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,200
um what if you're trying to learn from

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,079
content creator streamers do you see as

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,920
a compelling developer

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,920
relations content specific to the live

00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,680
stream format

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,119
that's that's interesting there's a lot

00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,960
of content creators out there there's a

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,319
lot of content creation platforms you've

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,440
got all the

00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,720
content creators out there

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,480
we had a couple announcements last

00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,480
couple of days about even startups that

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,440
are going into the community engagement

00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,079
side of the fence do you see a

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,079
difference

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,359
similarities or how might you think

00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,000
about that

00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,400
so i think that live streaming taps into

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
the

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,760
hero um theme um

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,280
twilio did this very well in the early

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,000
days they had like

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,440
uh the php uh and they caught i think

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,640
they called ambassadors but they had

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,599
developer advocates

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,440
who were amazing and specific verticals

00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,400
they were amazing in python they were

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,359
amazing in

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,680
php they were amazing in java they were

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,160
amazing in microservices and these were

00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,119
like the heroes of that third-party

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,839
community

00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,359
so a live stream is all about a certain

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:14,480
person sitting and being

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,680
the hero um and and hail helping a

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,480
community so it's a

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,440
broadcast it's a one to a lot and what

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,400
we've seen in

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,599
in twitch is regardless of like whether

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
it's developed relations or not

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,119
developed relations

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,359
um the people who cared most about their

00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,800
community were the most successful

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:36,240
so if you turn or developer advocates

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,280
into um heroes into lives people who do

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,920
live streaming

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,359
on an ongoing basis and foster and care

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,119
about the community

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,280
live streaming is a great way of

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,720
engaging because it creates

00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,359
um a few things it creates immediacy

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,960
so you can actually ask questions so i'm

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,480
i'm playing with visual studio or

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,319
something like that

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,240
and then somebody say hey you use the

00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:59,200
shortcut what did you use and i say hey

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,160
it's control

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,119
for something right f and and it there's

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,760
an immediacy

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:08,160
there's also like the the a moment in

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,559
time and i remember that with my kid

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,040
with ninja the first time my kid

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,640
contributed to ninja like send them uh

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,359
bits and um and ninja said hey thank you

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,599
johnny

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:24,240
my kid was like boom he said johnny

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,359
i'm a hero now so like finding people in

00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,680
your community

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,040
and making them the hero for the moment

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,000
is a great way so like

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,480
having guests in your stream is another

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,960
uh

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,520
great way to engage with your community

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,319
so

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,640
what i think my general perspective on

00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,680
this

00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,480
is look at the medium look at who's very

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,960
successful

00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,680
on this medium and then of live

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,240
streaming

00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,839
look at how they engage how they uh

00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,160
interact with their community

00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,040
and then extrapolate that on developer

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,359
outreach

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,440
um and i think it's the same thing the

00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,920
peop developers are like people

00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,760
are our people um and people like to

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,440
engage in community activities

00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:08,160
and streaming is the next big developer

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,160
outreach i think that's fascinating

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,760
because if you actually extract

00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,280
what's happening in a lot of other

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,599
creator content

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,200
vertical markets to the developer

00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,040
specific

00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,960
function if you look at tik tok or

00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,440
instagram

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,119
the sub stack type of things that are

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,960
happening that is exactly

00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,559
what you described there that's going on

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,359
those those different areas

00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,760
this is applied to the developer i mean

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,760
i

00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,119
love that you gave me an idea of like

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,319
trying tick tock that's

00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,040
that's a great idea 60 seconds on a

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,280
certain

00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,480
api that would be amazing but it's like

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,280
you kind of like blew my mind for a

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,800
second because we

00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,720
they're all people at the end of the day

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,240
well how we engage with each other

00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,680
particularly obviously in covet but in

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,200
the general world too

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,720
you know we can learn from the different

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,760
verticals like what is happening with

00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,440
all the podcasts at the moment and

00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,760
is trying to do is create heroes out of

00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,559
certain celebrity personas that they go

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,800
out and you know

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,800

00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,960
happening over here and then i can bring

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,319
it back to the developer world too so
