Title: OCTO Speaker Series #7 Peter van Hardenberg
Publication date: 2021-02-26
Playlist: OCTO Speaker Series
Description: 
	Local-first Computing

We were promised "bicycles for the mind", but the vision of computers as tools for thought remains elusive. In our pursuit of this ideal, we have identified design principles we call "local-first software" that can help our software run faster, last longer, and cost less to build. We'll start by talking about the ideas that motivate our research, then look at some real-world prototypes and the technologies behind them, and finally talk about the challenges still outstanding.

Peter van Hardenberg has worked as an Arctic oceanographer, a game developer, wrangled a (literal) million Postgres databases, and is now Executive Director of Ink & Switch where he plots the future of tools for thought.

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,040
hi everyone

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,080
welcome to the seventh episode of the

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
octo speaker series

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
my name is idan and i run the developer

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
experiences research team

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
in github's office of the cto today our

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
guest is peter van hardenberg

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
i've had the pleasure of working with

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,359
peter previously at heroku where he

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
formed a data team that operated

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
something on the order of

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,840
a hundred thousand databases per

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
engineer but

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
it's his latter day work running inc and

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
switch that i think

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,360
most about in my work here at octo tools

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,600
for thought

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
is the banner that hangs over a lot of

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
the research at ink and switch how

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
can we use these amazing little

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
rectangles in our pockets and on our

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
desks

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,320
to help our brains reason about more

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,399
complex things

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
what will arrange information so that

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
it's easier for us to spot patterns and

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
understand behaviors

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,680
as a software engineer this sounds an

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,320
awful lot like the core challenge we

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
face

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,439
when writing software how do we keep all

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,400
this stuff in our heads

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
how do we set up systems which help us

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
know more

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,200
at the cost of less thinking or with

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
fewer mistakes

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
i hear a lot about the race towards

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,280
crafting artificial facsimiles of my

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
brain but often

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
what i want is something that aids me

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,520
something that gives me leverage gives

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,159
me

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,960
superpowers peter's work at incan switch

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
touches on

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
so many of these topics with such

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
satisfying technical depth

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,600
so it's with a ton of excitement that i

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
welcome him today to the octo speaker

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
series knowing that i'm probably

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,119
about to get a view of the future

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,119
disguised as a history lesson

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
one final note before peter comes on

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,880
we'll be taking questions in the github

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,799
discussions thread the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
url is down here on the screen i'll also

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,320
try to keep an eye out for

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
questions and twist chat please keep

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
things uh

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
positive and welcoming to everyone we've

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
got a code of conduct in the repo

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
that the discussions thread is on and

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
it's important to us that everybody

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,440
abide by that

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:12,480
so without further ado welcome peter

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,239
hi thanks for having me ah it's my

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
pleasure uh thanks so much for

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,200
uh for coming on um looking forward to

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,080
to to the mystery mystery topic of

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
local first computing great yeah well i

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
mean

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
this is a an area of research we've been

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
uh plowing for some time so i'm glad to

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
have a chance to come and talk to

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
everybody about it today

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,239
shall i uh take the stand here please

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,879
take it away all right let's get my

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
screen share

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
okay can we see that yes you're good to

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,440
go

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
excellent so what i want to do is

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
basically

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
try and connect two lines of reasoning

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
that have been running for a long time

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,159
both

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
in our research at incan switch but also

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,319
in the broader

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,640
computer community for for decades

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,519
and so i want to start by talking about

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,239
uh the mind

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,239
amplifier

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,840
this is an image of the eniac main

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,120
control panel eniac was the first

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,400
programmable computer the year was 1946.

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,640
the war had just been won by the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,840
americans if you believe

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,400
american popular history and this

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
first computer was used predictably

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,440
because it was built by the military

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,879
to serve military aims it was built to

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,319
calculate

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,080
field artillery firing sheets

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,519
or rather it was built to prove a point

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,519
but its

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,720
first application was to calculate these

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,480
tables quickly and efficiently

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,920
around this time a number of the sort of

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,920
leading figures of

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,000
the war including this man buckminster

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
fuller were beginning to turn their

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
attention

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,760
from winning the war to winning the

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,040
peace

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,599
bucky fuller a man at least as much myth

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,200
as reality

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
talked about the concept of livingry

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,239
instead of weaponry because as

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,959
overseeing the u.s and ally

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,840
economic efforts to support the war he

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,960
was able to

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,000
coordinate and distribute resources

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,960
uh across the entire world and asked

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
himself why

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,560
they could build barracks for you know

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,919
tens of thousands of soldiers in a

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,440
matter of days but they couldn't house

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,840
homeless people back home once the war

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,840
was done

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
the ironically the effort to build eniac

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,759
was

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,800
undermined and thwarted by uh the man

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,840
we see uh depicted here

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
promoting the first google glass van of

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
our bush

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,360
venevar bush was the leader of

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,720
the u.s uh science and research effort

00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
and helped organize the manhattan

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
project

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,600
and was not actually much of a fan of

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
computers he didn't feel that they would

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
be built in time

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
to help win the war which was his his

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,720
mandate

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
to his uh credit or perhaps because of

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
his

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,120
undermining in fact eniac wasn't

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
completed until 1946 and so

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
did not actually help the allies win the

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,560
war

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,840
but even at this time venevar was

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
interested in

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
what came later to be known as

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,160
intelligence amplification

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,639
which was to say what if we had machines

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
that went beyond helping us work that

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,400
gave us mechanical advantage

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,800
and started to consider machines that

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
would give us intellectual advantage

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
this is the memex uh it was published in

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,160
1946 in the atlantic again the

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
sort of just before the interregnum

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
between

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,000
uh wars at the end of world war ii and

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
before the cold war really started to

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
ignite

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,039
um and you know he proposed

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,120
a complex mechanical system uh which

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,520
many people have tried for decades since

00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
to

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
rebuild either in spirit or in in actual

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,400
form

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,759
uh bush was not a computer guy

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,319
but we owe a lot to lick glider

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,400
who prefer to be called lick and jcr

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,639
lick lighter

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:22,639
who had been essentially a psychologist

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,280
an academic researching uh

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
you know the mind discovered computers

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
in the

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,039
uh i guess late 50s early 60s and wrote

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,720
this paper man-computer symbiosis which

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,680
proposed that you know computers could

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
make

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,400
people smarter uh not just the sort of

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
modern idea that

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
oh computers will replace intelligence

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
but the computers could enhance

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,039
intelligence this came to the attention

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,960
of uh of leaders in the new

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,880
arpa institution and led to his

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,039
involvement as a human factors person

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,479
in building sage sage

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,479
was the u.s system for detecting

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,599
and scrambling fighters to intercept

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
russian bombers before they could deploy

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
a nuclear attack

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,960
on u.s territory it was phenomenally

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,120
complicated

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
this is the first i think example of an

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
interactive computer terminal that was

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,080
designed

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,479
by lick lighter and his

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
team and the cost of building these

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
systems at the time

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
actually exceeded the cost of the

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
manhattan project which

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,360
was something that was noted with some

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,479
irony that preventing the result of the

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
manhattan project cost

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,319
more than the project itself ever did

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
and all

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
as anybody who's built complex one-off

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
computer systems knows it never

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,240
really worked all that well

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,080
but lick glider's work

00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,160
evolved into you know eventually

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,440
being tasked at the uh the ipto the his

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,720
his computing uh branch of

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,639
the then arpa system to

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
focus on command and control which led

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
to the birth of the internet

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,960
and eventually over time uh he returned

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,160
to these questions

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,199
of man-computer symbiosis and that led

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
to the work here

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
of ivan sutherland who's demonstrating

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,759
sketchpad

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,479
a sketchpad is sort of considered the

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,720
genesis

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
of the modern sort of interactive

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,240
computer and

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,479
some of the ideas in sketchpad are still

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,800
quite radical and exciting if you watch

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
the video or read the paper today

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,560
as you can see you know sketchpad

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
occupied an entire wall it used

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,640
you know very rudimentary images but it

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
allowed for direct manipulation

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
of drawings and basically gave birth to

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
cad

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
and what i'm drawing here is perhaps not

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,920
the

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
most in any way the most comprehensive

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
or uh

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,279
indeed even like usefully accurate uh

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
history of

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,839
human factors in computer science but

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
what i'm trying to do is basically

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
create a thread that stretches back from

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,920
these early 1930s systems to today

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,320
and sutherland was brought in by lick to

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
actually work on these systems

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,839
and sutherland of course uh inspired

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
engelbart

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,519
engelbart famously the

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
the man behind the mother of all demos

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
or at least credited with the mother of

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,399
all demos as as in many of these cases

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
he was the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
you know leader of the project certainly

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
by no means the only contributor though

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
his name is best remembered

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
and here he's demonstrating nls the

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,200
online system

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,839
which demonstrated collaborative systems

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,040
with real-time video conferencing

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,000
back in the 1960s

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,480
all of this was around again this idea

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,760
of amplifying the mind that we could

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
use computers not just to you know

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,800
compute to calculate

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,240
to you know estimate but

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,720
to actually symbiose with

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,519
human mind and extend it and empower it

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
right much

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,680
like you know a sound amplifier can take

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,519
a quiet noise and make it louder we

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,440
wanted a mind amplifier we could augment

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,040
the human intellect

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,800
uh this work evolved over time and

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,279
you know eventually led to the xerox

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,320
park research lab led by bob taylor

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,560
and you know that work really started to

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,720
dive into these concepts again

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
and you know eventually steve jobs came

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
and and uh

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,200
raided xerox park for all their good

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
ideas producing

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
apple and the macintosh and the

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,360
so-called bicycle for the mind

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,200
i love this metaphor by the way of the

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,839
bicycle for the mind as so many people

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
do

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
because a bicycle gives you mechanical

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
advantage but it's designed to be nimble

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,079
you know it's not a battleship it's not

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
you know it's not a tank

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
its purpose is not to dominate or

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
destroy it's to

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
uh you know to give you advantage to

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
make you more agile and to get you

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,399
places you couldn't get on your own

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,480
now the work of you know sutherland

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
and and lick glider and and taylor and

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
engelbart

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,000
um you know that thread continues on uh

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
through the decades with allen k's

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,560
dynabook uh and of course

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
with brett victor's dynamic land which

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
is still active today in

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,240
oakland but the sort of general

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,920
principle here

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,360
is of symbiosis of extension of

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,839
partnership between a person and a

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
computer

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,880
and i think this is an important concept

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
to internalize

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,640
uh the strongest chess player in the

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,839
world is not

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
a person you know deep blue

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,839
beat kasparov and took the title for

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
computers uh decades ago now

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
it's also not a computer program though

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,839
the strongest

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,440
chess player in the world is a centaur

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,959
and there's a form of chess competition

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,320
called centaur chess

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,600
where human players paired with software

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,920
compete against each other and at least

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,680
today that's still the strongest way to

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,120
to play chess and so this concept of a

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
centaur of a person

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,880
you know made stronger made more capable

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,120
by

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
by the computer systems that they employ

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
it's something we see in a lot of

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
domains

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,279
you know certainly in the academic or

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
engineering space we have tools like

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
isabel which is a theorem prover

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
that allows you know researchers to sort

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
of state the problem they want to prove

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,200
give isabelle the right sort of clues

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,959
and hints and then push a button and a

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,040
proof will pop out the other side

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,480
uh and solidworks which is engineering

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
software that can integrate

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
you know complex numerical simulations

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
of fluid dynamics or

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,440
you know masses and loads and things

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,000
that to do by hand would be nearly

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
impossible and of course mathematica

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
which you know is a pretty direct line

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
descendant of a lot of these ideas and

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,279
honestly old enough now to have its own

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,519
place in that pedigree

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,320
and so of course you know the mission is

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,440
accomplished

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,480
right um we're done here we've we've

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,639
augmented the human intellect and uh

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,040
we can pat ourselves on the back and

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
head home

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:15,120
except except maybe we can't

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,320
you see this is not a complete history

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
of computing

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,800
and declaring mission accomplished is uh

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,000
on these sort of endless uh

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,760
challenges uh is always a mistake

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,120
in fact we've seen a lot of retrograde

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,399
action around

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
computers as tools for thinking in

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
the last couple of decades and a lot of

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,880
that has to do

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,240
with uh changes in the platforms that

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,519
we use to do our our to engage in our

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,199
computing lives and

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,120
you know push notifications is a lot of

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
talk about the attention economy and

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
push notifications and distraction and

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
of course that's a huge

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,680
feature there's a lot of difficulty

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,399
created

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,040
by uh what i would call sas modern sas

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
software

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,920
in that it is fragile or slow and let's

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
let's take a quick detour before we come

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
back to the details there and i want to

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
talk about

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,880
workshops and what a thought workers

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
workshop might look like

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,240
this is a wood shop uh this wood shop is

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,320
in the outer sunset in

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
san francisco next door to a really good

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
fish taco place

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,920
it's called the wood shop appropriately

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
enough and this wood shop would look

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,560
legible

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,120
to any woodworker in the world and any

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,000
uh woodworker even going back uh decades

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,720
the basic set of tools a woodworker uses

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
a chisel

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,040
a saw you know they've been electrified

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,639
and even computerized but fundamentally

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,240
you know there's a set of composable

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,240
tools that could produce

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
almost anything made of wood and in fact

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,120
in the wood shop four different

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,040
um uh artists and artisans share the

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
space and the tools to both have the

00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
camaraderie but also to

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,839
you know because their tools are

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,600
interchangeable

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,360
the interchangeability of tools in a

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,120
workshop their universality their

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,160
durability over time

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,600
and their general applicability are real

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,240
challenges that i think we have not

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
answered

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
in the domain of thought work it's

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,079
remarkable how

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,680
poor compatibility is in the thought

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
work space between tools

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,240
let's take a moment and consider what

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,240
the tools of a thought worker look like

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,279
by going to the workshop of a thought

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,040
worker this is uh john conway famous for

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,600
the game of life and and all kinds of

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,680
other mathematical breakthroughs

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,199
at his office in princeton of course we

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
see a computer on his desk

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,160
but we also see him surrounded by well

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,720
mess yes but also inspiration

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
other ideas books papers things that he

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,199
needs to read

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
you know a phone for reaching out and

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
contacting people

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,240
uh you know his workshop is a rich

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,560
environment

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,079
and so if we think about kind of you

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
know the process of building a chair you

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,440
know you get wood you plane it you

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,759
thickness it you cut it to length

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
you fasten it you finish it well we

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
could look at the same kind of process

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,800
or

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,279
what science looks like so here's a very

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,600
simplified and idealized model of that

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
you take a bunch of old ideas you get

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
some new data

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,800
and then you know you drink coffee you

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
have a lot of long baths and

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
procrastinate

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
and then somehow after a little while a

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,600
peer-reviewed journal

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,600
pops out now that middle stage actually

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,759
has a lot of articulation that i think

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
would be irresponsible of me to try and

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
squeeze into

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,040
a talk today this sort of rumination and

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,399
there's drafting and there's

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,800
you know active reading and there's a

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
lot of tools and techniques people use

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,320
to get through that and honestly that's

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,199
where a lot of this kind of

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,000
thought tools operate but i want to sort

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,000
of zoom back

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,199
from the construct construction of a

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
single idea

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,160
to note that in fact scientists and

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,040
researchers generally have many ideas on

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
the go

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,839
it's not like you sort of sit down and

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
you're like i am going to think a

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,440
thought today and then you build it

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,120
one piece at a time but rather you have

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
something that's more like a garden

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,919
where there are many pieces of

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,439
information percolating and growing and

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,280
some things are growing quickly and

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,319
other things will never go anywhere

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,919
and so you have this sort of large

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,360
corpus of ideas always kind of

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,640
fermenting and working away

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,880
so if we come back to the question of

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,120
what are these tools for thought workers

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,120
well then we should ask ourselves what

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,559
what are the properties of a good tool

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,440
this is a john economaki hp9 thickness

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,840
plane

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
john aconimacki was a woodworker who

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,720
developed a wood dust allergy

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
became unable to to do his favorite work

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,919
and so he got into tool making for

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
woodworkers instead

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,760
i mentioned him to a woodworking

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,320
professional woodworking friend of mine

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
and he laughed and said oh no one who

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
actually works in woodworking uses those

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,640
tools those are for lawyers they're much

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
too expensive for people who work in the

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,679
field

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,360
but these tools are undeniably beautiful

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
well-crafted

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,400
uh objects and so let's talk a little

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,039
bit about the tools that properties of

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,320
tools that thought workers

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,160
need i think first and foremost if we're

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,120
thinking about

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,559
the challenge of thought work in the

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,600
modern era we need to

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,960
talk about focus attention is a limited

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
quantity that we need to preserve we

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,120
have a

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,120
you know the hardest thing in the world

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,440
is these days to

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,000
shut out everything else and to focus in

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,039
on the problem at hand

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
tools for thought that don't prioritize

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,120
that

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
are going to be worse than tools that do

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,039
our tools for thinking also should be

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
incredibly responsive we want them to

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,760
feel

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
effortless frictionless you know

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
marshall mcluhan talks about

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,720
you know the hammer becoming an

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
extension of your body

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
uh we want

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
our tools to stay out of our way to

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,559
invisibly support us and never to kind

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,280
of

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,679
create obstacles to thinking or to doing

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
with our minds

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
it's really important that our tools are

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,480
reliable in particular

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,720
uh this is an area that we struggle

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,559
today which is that these tools that

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
that we rely on we want them to be

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,600
available to us

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,960
anywhere and anytime we want them to

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,360
work you know

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,440
in our kitchens and on our front steps

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
and we want them to work in 10 years and

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
we want them to

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,400
you know come with us in airplanes and

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
you know

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,919
there's very few tools that are better

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,400
for this than a notebook right like an

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,080
actual physical piece of paper and a pen

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
passes all these tests it's got no push

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,919
notifications

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
you know you can never unzip a battery

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,640
you know you can stick it on your shelf

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
and come back to it five years later

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
it's still gonna work you're not gonna

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,200
have to run any system updates

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
so we could kind of keep pulling this

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,240
thread and and thinking these thoughts

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,200
and we did and that's what led us to

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,200
local first software

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,960
so local first software is a summation

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,080
of some of

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,600
our thinking about what

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,520
kinds of properties are important and

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,640
valuable

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,000
for tools for thought and i'm going to

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,679
sort of run through what our

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,520
seven ideals for local first software

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,960
are uh

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,679
first you know we believe that uh your

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
tools

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,960
should have no spinners your work should

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
always be at your fingertips you should

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
never have to wait for things to

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,799
download or sync

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
and if you're australian you know the

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,640
entire internet is always about a second

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,039
and a half away from you

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,240
um and i'm going to move fairly quickly

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,640
through these we can talk about any of

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
them

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
later if you have questions about

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,520
anything go into more depth

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,200
it's vital that your work is not trapped

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,799
in one device

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
you know there's nothing more

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
frustrating than when you're sort of

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,240
taking notes

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,240
on your desktop and then you get

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
you know to the coffee shop and you pull

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,559
out your phone and

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,840
it's not there right like you you wanna

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,360
you wanna have all of your ideas your

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,799
content needs to be available to you or

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,400
else you have this friction between you

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,080
and what you're doing

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,840
um it's important that the network is

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,200
optional you know when i joined the lab

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,520
i remember having this conversation with

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
adam wiggins the past lab director

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,280
about like oh sure you know this stuff's

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,080
all good but it doesn't really matter

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
the internet is

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,120
is everywhere and it's just getting

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
better and he sort of laughed and said

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,840
like

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,320
is that true you know do you have the

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,240
internet on your front doorstep

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,760
um and in fact this spot this picture

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
here is my kitchen

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,360
apologies it's a little messy but you

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,000
can see right there next to the

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,080
uh that oven mitt that's the most

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,600
obvious place in the kitchen to put down

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,600
an ipad or a laptop with a recipe on it

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
and thanks to the particular

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
configuration of my apartment

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,200
it's also the one place in the kitchen

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,400
that has absolutely no wi-fi access

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
because the refrigerator

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
creates a giant shadow that blocks it

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,360
out

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,919
and so there's nothing more annoying

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,600
than you know switching back to a tab to

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,880
find the recipe for some sauce or

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
something else you're trying to make

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,000
and suddenly you have the offline

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
dinosaur right and you have to stop and

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,200
get up and carry the machine to another

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
spot and reconnect and get the thing and

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,840
then put it back

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,039
and it's you know it's really

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
frustrating and kind of pointless

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,080
because that data was there but

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
for some reason my computer's thrown it

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
away now of course

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,080
collaboration is table stakes now for

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,760
any kind of

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,840
uh useful software you know we

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,799
we can't imagine going back to an era

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
where

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,000
uh you know collaboration is not built

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,280
in

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,640
to everything we do um but

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,440
at the same time we want to build for

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,400
the long now uh these cuneiform tablets

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
have lasted

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
thousands of years and remained legible

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,240
but

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,320
you know it's so common for the software

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
we rely on today to go on sort of an

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,799
incredible journey

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,440
um which is to say you know you build

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
something

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,120
people love it they use it they adopt it

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,559
they make a part of their lives and then

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
you know you run out of money or apple

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,880
buys you or whatever and then it's gone

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,760
um that's okay for a lot of things i

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
mean it's not really the end of the

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
world if

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
you can't watch a show that you were

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,600
watching before you know you have to

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,480
find another weather provider

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,000
but when you're building creative output

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,080
you know often

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,320
you know a research paper for a journal

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,840
or a book that you're writing can take

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,679
years or even decades to produce and so

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,080
you know you need to trust in your tools

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,120
and you need to choose software that is

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,799
for a longer time frame than

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,799
people today often think through

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,960
again if you're building for creative

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,880
thinking it's important that

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,320
you uh you know you you trust

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,360
that the work that you do

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,760
is kept secure and private um i think

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
that

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,039
from an emotional perspective this is

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
particularly important i mean yeah the

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,520
gdpr

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,760
and data privacy and data security is

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,400
important but this isn't just about sort

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,000
of

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
you know paranoid thinking but it's also

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
about the kind of emotional security

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,279
that you have in doing your work

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
when you know that no one's peering over

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,880
your shoulder before you're ready

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
right like if you're working on a work

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
project you might not be

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,840
ready to show it to your boss until

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
you've thought it through you don't want

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
to embarrass yourself you want to have

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,360
that

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,720
that space where you can work quietly

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,279
apart from other people until you're

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,880
ready to share things more broadly

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,400
um and you know ultimately kind of all

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
of this boils down to the question of

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,279
who

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,200
who owns and controls the tool that you

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,080
have if i buy a chisel i take it home

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
and it's mine

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
if i want to put a new handle on it i

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,200
can this is an

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,360
image of word star four george martin

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360
is writing ostensibly the game of

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,799
thrones song of fire and ice novels call

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,080
it what you will

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,200
on an old ibm pc uh

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,000
running ms-dos and using word star four

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
uh he's doing that now still today

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,279
allegedly

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,520
because that's the software that he

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
started the series in

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,679
and i just think that's so remarkable

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,120
that you know and almost unthinkable

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,400
like he must know those tools so well

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,240
he must have so much mastery over

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,360
that stack and for him i can imagine him

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,799
not wanting

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,440
to change to a new system uh

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,039
if if somebody else can you know come

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
into your workshop and move around all

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,960
your tools and change how they work it's

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,640
it's not your workshop it's theirs

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
and so it's not to say that i'm in any

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
way opposed to

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,919
uh progress or improvement or

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,000
consistency

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,679
but just that uh those things should

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,279
happen under your terms

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,880
when you're ready and when they serve

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
your needs not the needs of a product

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,000
manager or corporate

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,279
entity that provides those tools to you

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,039
so those are the uh seven

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,039
ideals of local first software and we

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,159
think that these things connect back

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,919
to uh building

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
great tools for thought and i i think

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,240
since we're here talking to github it'd

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,880
be good to

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,840
sort of comment on uh from the paper we

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,720
we sort of scored github on these seven

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,200
uh marks you know between git and github

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,600
as a combined system

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
um and we think git is obviously very

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,000
fast it works offline

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,360
you know git and now github has enough

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,640
sort of track record we'll give you some

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,480
marks for longevity

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,559
we believe that it does get in

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,600
particular empower users

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,880
um but you know git is only barely

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,559
available

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,240
uh across multiple devices uh and you

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
have to manually synchronize things all

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
the time if you want to get anything

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,600
done

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,159
if you put your data up on github

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
it is only private through the herculean

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,080
efforts of

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
github's security and privacy teams by

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,760
default

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,720
github is very public and very open and

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,480
the sort of corporate versions of github

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,960
are still public

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,000
to administrators and within the company

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
um

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,320
you know the cloud requires extra effort

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
to become private as we currently

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
conceive it it's not secure or private

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,240
by default

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,320
your data is pooled in big databases

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,320
unencrypted

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,600
and then in terms of collaboration you

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,720
know i i think github has pioneered

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,919
something really magical with the pull

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
request

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,720
but a lot of github is only

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
semi-collaborative and requires sort of

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,640
manual refreshing there's no real-time

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
collaboration in a lot of github

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,880
that's kind of a legacy of the tooling

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,159
and infrastructure from the era that it

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,360
was born out of

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,200
um you know the the rails app predates

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,080
which started github started as a rails

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
app

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,200
and that predates kind of modern

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,799
conceptions about real-time

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,520
collaboration and modern expectations

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
about what that looks like

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,720
so not to pick on github i think it's a

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,200
you know in many ways uh

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,720
some aspects of github are exemplary in

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,080
these domains and others are

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,120
more challenging we all have a long way

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,799
to go that's why we're doing this

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,760
research

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,360
so i want to turn my attention now from

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
kind of vague philosophical thoughts to

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,120
talking about some of the built

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,240
systems that we've explored at incan

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,240
switch

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,840
and if we have time maybe later we can

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
even look at one of them

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,200
um live that i've got running on my

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,880
machine here

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,480
um but we'll start with sort of a a tour

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,399
so our first project working in this

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,679
space was a little trello

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,679
clone we call trellis

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,120
you know this was our first attempt to

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
build a piece of local first software

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,799
it's an electron app

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,799
because browsers are not very good at

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,960
storing data and you know

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,880
pwas are fine but we found we just

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,480
couldn't trust

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,919
that the pwa would be there when you

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,600
came back so we wanted to build an app

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,000
that somebody could download and really

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,440
have

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,919
and really feel that feeling that like

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,200
this is the thing on my computer

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
and electron is great for that

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,720
what you can see here in the image on

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,559
the right is sort of two views of the

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,960
same data the main view sort of our

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,559
our quasi trello and then on the right

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,159
you have a change log

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,559
and those are two representations of the

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,520
same information and in fact in trellis

00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,440
you can

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
click back through time and you can see

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,240
each change

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,440
um you know like popping off the stack

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
so you can go back and look at how

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
things used to be so you can say

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,399
you know what did this look like

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
yesterday morning how does it change and

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,880
who made those changes and that's built

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:20,000
into the tech stack that we built

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:24,000
we built this system on top of webrtc

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,600
webrtc is a technology built into

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
browsers that's designed

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,080
to allow peer-to-peer video and audio

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,919
chat it's

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,279
probably how this stream yard tool we're

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
using today works

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,559
but webrtc requires centralized

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
infrastructure for signaling which is to

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,039
say helping the different computers

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,640
discover each other

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,559
and so a good amount of our research in

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,000
this project went into just figuring out

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,679
how we could do that

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
uh without having to stand up servers

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
our goal was that

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,120
every copy of trellis should be able to

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,200
talk directly to other copies of trellis

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
so that you know months later when we

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,919
were no longer working on this project

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,840
that it could survive the long now right

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,880
you can still check trellis out of

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,919
um out of a repo and use it

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,520
but trellis you know trellis doesn't

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,799
require central cloud infrastructure for

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,440
you to collaborate

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,120
but it's a very early rudimentary effort

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,760
and it does require you to like set up

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,520
manual port forwards in your firewall

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,399
one fun story about this project is that

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,960
we had actually

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,919
created a bunch of slack bots for each

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,080
of the users

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
and put the api keys into our trellis

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
installs

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
so that when you opened up trellis it

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,760
would actually go to a special channel

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,279
in our slack and announce itself and try

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,640
and discover other peers

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,640
and that was really dumb but kind of fun

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,679
uh until we started hitting anti-flood

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
protection

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,279
in slack and uh because when more than

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,799
four people were using it the system

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,320
would just totally overwhelm

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,159
and at that point we're like okay you

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,600
know this was a neat experiment but

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,240
it didn't pan out um what trellis did

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,919
though

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,279
uh and in particular roshan chuksi who

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,279
was sort of the lead engineer on the

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,919
application side of this pointed out was

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,360
that there was a really appealing

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
sort of connection between like a data

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,919
document

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,279
representing the data in the application

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:21,120
and a renderer in a react style

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,559
application to display it but before we

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,080
get into that i want to talk just

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,200
briefly about crdts in auto merge

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,000
a crdt put simply

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,559
is a mergeable data structure if you

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,600
think about

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,120
git right in git you have files which

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,799
are made up of lines

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,399
you can remove lines and you can add

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,320
lines and if two people edit the same

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,720
line then that's a conflict

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,799
auto merge is essentially a similar

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,799
process it does a similar task

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,960
but instead of working on an array of

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,799
lines auto merge works on

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
something more like the fields of a json

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,080
data structure

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,080
so instead of having to add or remove a

00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,679
line and then you know if we both

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,360
add an element to an array is that a

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,320
conflict or not in auto merge you have

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,519
operations like

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,720
insert element in array or change value

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,799
of this field

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,399
and so when you get a whole bunch of

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,880
edits from a whole bunch of people

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,960
you know you can sort of build up a

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
to-do list and then you can exchange

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,600
those changes

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,039
as they're recorded into logs over the

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,279
network and then produce

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,799
documents the promise of a crdt is that

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,519
given the same data everyone will see

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,960
the same thing and you could do that

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
trivially by just throwing away all the

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,159
data but what auto merge says is that

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,640
given the same

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,200
data everyone will see the same useful

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,960
thing

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,399
and a lot of the subtlety and

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,240
interesting design decisions that go

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,679
into building crdts comes down to sort

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,960
of thinking like

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,279
well you know what order should things

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,760
in an

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,399
array be in if two people both insert

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,159
them

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,600
and the answer by the way is generally

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,279
you want all of the edits from each

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,840
person to appear together and not

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
interleaved

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,799
so having built trellis we want went on

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,000
to build pixel pusher

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:10,480
we were excited about

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,880
our experience with uh

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,320
with crdts and we had you know we

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
contacted martin klepman who wrote the

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,559
json crdt paper and teamed up with him

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,159
to build the first version of auto merge

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,360
um and it worked very surprisingly

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,840
so we thought okay well that was

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,600
probably just a fluke um

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,720
so what we wanted to do was to find

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,159
somebody else's software and try and add

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,880
collaboration to it based on these crdts

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
and so for this project we had such a

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,679
miserable experience trying to get

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,720
webrtc working that we wanted to try

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,159
something new

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,000
so we trialled a couple of different

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,240
peer-to-peer technologies before

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,200
winding up using something called dat

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,600
and so

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,480
dat is kind of like an atomized kafka

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,840
a dat uh data is built on something

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
called a hypercore which is an append

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,159
only log it works quite a bit like git

00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,679
where

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,919
each new thing that gets written into

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,840
the log uh

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,279
refers to the thing before it and so you

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,240
can just request the head and it will

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,320
give you the full

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,839
history of that thing you know each one

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,079
signed with the previous commit hash

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,879
basically so you can guarantee integrity

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,240
and then it uses some cool peer-to-peer

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,480
distribution tricks

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,359
sort of inspired by bittorrent to allow

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,359
you to

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,119
use one of these kind of opaque tokens

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,159
at the top here these like ugly crypto

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,119
hashes

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,560
to uh to discover other people who have

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,960
that file and then share it

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,639
and so pixel pusher was was you know one

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,079
just like a really fun way to experiment

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,159
with these technologies

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,560
we spend a lot of time i think

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,359
unsuccessfully sadly exploring

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,200
how you could hybridize the google docs

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,000
real-time collaboration with suggestions

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,280
model

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,280
and github's wonderful but incredibly

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,200
baroque and hostile to non-technical

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,440
users pull request model

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,720
into sort of a real-time hybrid i think

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,520
there's a lot more work to do there we

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,200
haven't had time to return to it yet

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,200
but there's i think it's an important

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,960
problem to solve we also

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,240
built a simple conflict resolution

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,680
system you can see

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,400
in the blog post linked there on the

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,839
slide um a little bit more on that but

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,599
essentially we could detect if more than

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,960
one person and edited the same pixel and

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,240
then merge it

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,720
give you a merge interface a little

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,320
hover icon and so on more than anything

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
pixel pusher is great it's really fun to

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,839
play with

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,240
um you know i would encourage you to

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
like

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,599
if you're interested in this stuff grab

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,040
a copy of pixel pusher try and get it

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,599
working with a couple of friends and

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
then

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,040
you know start drawing something

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,079
together and we would in our testing

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,800
sessions we would

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,680
uh uh uh like literally just

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
build some pictures for fun as part of

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,480
our system and see if we could break it

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,920
or how the performance evolved

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,680
so yeah it's a rare treat to get to

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,680
build pixel art during a work meeting

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
the next major system i want to

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,440
highlight is pushpin

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,040
so pushpin is sort of our most fully

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,920
implemented

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,440
exploration of a lot of these concepts

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,440
and

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
pushpin is a media canvas in the style

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,359
of

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,240
milo note or the muse app which is spun

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,000
out of other research at the lab

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,119
and it's you know it's built around

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,599
these ideals so it uses auto merge and

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,440
uh peer-to-peer data distribution to

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,000
create a collaborative media canvas

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
where

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,760
you know in this example i'm sort of

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
researching neighborhoods of the bay

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,520
area where it might be good to

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,520
to move to um

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,079
it's an interesting challenge once you

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,839
start to

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,599
really pull the user experience thread

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,280
of what local first software means and

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,240
looks like

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,680
you get into really cool questions about

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,599
you know in the traditional

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,359
uh you know github model for example of

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,960
collaboration you either can reach

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,880
github or you can't you're online or

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,839
you're not um but if you have a really

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,119
peer-to-peer system

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,119
you start to have questions about like

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,839
well who's online am i

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,200
online are you online are we online

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,640
together but we're actually on an

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,839
airplane communicating over bluetooth

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,560
from 30 000 feet

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,160
but we can't reach anybody else and so

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,920
as you start to try and synchronize your

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,480
data across all your devices in real

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,000
time and to cloud peers

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
so that it's you know backed up and

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,839
durable you get a lot of really

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,160
interesting challenges there

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,560
pushpin again it works we've written a

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,200
lot about our experiences

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,760
in a paper that uh we published last

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,880
year

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,240
at the uh pap pac uh it's again

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,359
linked at the bottom here we talk a lot

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,280
about the challenges of like

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,760
peer-to-peer nat traversal

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,000
and how much we like this sort of

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,520
functional reactive programming model

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,280
basically the push pin model is you have

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,920
a whole bunch of these little crdt

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
documents

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,280
all nested together and each one

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,359
is the the state for react component

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,119
and so as the data changes we just call

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,480
render on the react component and then

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,760
that might trigger renders of other

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,119
react components and so on down the tree

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,520
and that's been a really fun model to

00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
explore

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,240
the basic idea and in a little more

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,200
detail how that works

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,520
you know we use the crdt depicted here

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,560
to

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,599
ensure that everybody sees the same data

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,920
document

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,599
and then because react guarantees

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
convergence

00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,440
from if you start with the same data

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,280
that means that everybody

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,599
sort of out at the edges of the system

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,720
has these nice little loops where their

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,079
building uh changes the data so you know

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,760
just react you kind of

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,280
you send a message and then that causes

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,880
an update function and then that goes

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,560
back to the render function

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
and that's the nice little loop and then

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,280
all we do to make that collaborative is

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
we

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,680
basically tap into that react state and

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
then we share that over the network with

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,160
other peers

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,880
and so if you're working offline you

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,640
just batch up your changes until

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,560
you're ready to share them when you come

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
back online you flush all that log of

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
changes out and it merges with everybody

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,720
else's

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,560
there are several good talks about auto

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,160
merge go into more detail about all of

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
this and we also cover it more in the

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,640
paper

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,599
but feel free to ask questions after the

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,920
session if you want me to get into

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,320
specifics

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,079
so our most recent work cambria

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,599
was from this last summer or most recent

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,640
work i want to share here

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,359
was from last summer with jeffrey litt

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,800
and oh i should mention um pixel pusher

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,400
with was a collaboration with jeff

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,760
peterson and

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,000
jim pick and uh pushpin

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,040
had a number of developers but it also

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,400
included

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,280
um ignatius skillfeder and doing design

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,000
and matt tugnetti and jeff peterson

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
again

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
as well as other um lab members like

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,200
mark mcgrane again ad waynes

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,240
um and orion henry uh but so cambria

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,000
from this last summer was a

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,359
collaboration with jeffrey litt on

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,200
you know as we were building these

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,480
decentralized systems okay great we

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,520
managed to get all these systems working

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
together but if

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,640
you've ever worked on cloud systems and

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,119
apis you have this problem which is like

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,400
oh gee uh there's old clients out there

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,319
and i want to do something new with the

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
schema and now we have problems how do

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,079
we migrate the data

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,079
and you know this is a problem we were

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,800
very familiar with

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,319
as as developers from cloud systems and

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,200
particularly at heroku you know if you

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,040
have like

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,319
hundreds of thousands of users it's like

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,480
you want to change your api you're going

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,960
to have to do some serious work

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,400
there are meetings to be had right and

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
so we decided we would build sort of a

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,200
github issues style

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,319
experiment and our goal was to allow

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,599
every version of that program to

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,040
interact live

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,920
in real time with every other version of

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,359
the program by translating the schema of

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,680
the data

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,359
on demand between different versions and

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,560
by storing those schemas

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,440
in the data itself so that

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,520
we could fetch them i'm going to show an

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,040
example of what that looks like here

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,400
so you can see oh gee that's really

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,920
flickering for me i hope it's okay for

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,839
you but on the

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
right you can see we have to do doing

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,359
done these are like flags for a ticket

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,880
and on the left we have tickets that

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,200
just have

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,000
run that again on the left we have just

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,720
you know each item

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,160
is either done or not done and on sorry

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,760
on the left it's done or not done and on

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,560
the right we have an enum of different

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
values

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,079
and so what we've done is created a lens

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,640
a bi-directional function that

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,560
translates between the two and so you

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,240
can compose these lenses to build more

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,680
complicated migrations but this shows a

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,359
simple example of how

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,200
you can have interoperability between

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,400
the two we handle

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,880
you're going from a single value to

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,480
multiple values and changing field types

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,280
and renaming fields and all these kinds

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,640
of things

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,880
and so you can build up these like

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
migration networks and then be able to

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
you know have very different versions of

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,400
your software working on the same data

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,839
in real time and collaborating that's

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
very cool

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:49,839
uh the paper is linked on the ink and

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,839
switch page there as well

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
so okay enough of these examples i want

00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,920
to talk a little bit about what what

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,960
this all adds up to

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,040
um you know we've got these these

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,200
tools for thought that you know

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,240
everybody since van over bush

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,560
have wanted and yet the computing

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,200
environment we live in today

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,119
uh is somewhat hostile to actually

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,680
thinking and doing focused work that

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,839
takes

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,280
a long time so we've outlined these

00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,880
seven principles

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,880
which you know following these

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,920
principles will not build a tool for

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,440
thought

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,200
but it will if you follow these

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,040
principles

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,400
build better tools for thought than if

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,560
you don't right

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,079
you could also build social media

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,040
networks this way and i think they'd be

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
better too

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
but in particular i think when you're

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,040
dealing with

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,480
tools that people are going to rely on

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,000
for a long time and put important

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
information into i think that's where

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,720
these

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,480
principles are really important but we

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,640
have a lot of problems

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,960
right cloud software is fragile

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,800
expensive and high latency

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,480
you know it there's one instance of it

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,040
there's an ops team that has to keep it

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,520
online

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,119
and you know sas software is routinely

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,720
destroyed by market forces the

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:06,240
company gets acquired the founders

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,359
run out of money uh you know it's just

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,800
they have an outage

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,280
you move to a country where it's no

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,319
longer available etc

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,680
um the only real universal

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,079
cross-platform

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,280
system we have is the browser if you

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,599
want to have your data on all your

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,680
devices and browser's kind of bad it's

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,520
like storing data it's called a browser

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,200
not a keeper as i like to say

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
and not only that but browsers are also

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,880
really slow if you really want to have

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,800
these like frictionless tools that feel

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
like an extension of yourself

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,000
you know you can't be running them at 10

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,160
frames a second and waiting 200

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,079
milliseconds to get responses back from

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,280
from some web server you know it's got

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,520
to be as fast as your

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,480
your fingers can move as fast as you can

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520
think

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,599
um we have networking problems if you

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,440
really care about this sort of long now

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
thinking which is that collaboration

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,640
should outlast the businesses that

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,240
provide it

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,839
you know then you need to have some

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,720
ability to have direct peer-to-peer

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,560
connections

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,839
and in fact we talk about this a lot in

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,560
the pushpin paper but

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,240
basically offices and cafes which are

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
places people go to work together on

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,079
things

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,000
often have their networks set up to

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,839
prevent peer-to-peer connections

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,839
uh if you work at cisco please fix us

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,240
you know in terms of like high quality

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,480
interactions if you want to have those

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,160
you know fast high quality experiences

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,920
you've got to build native apps but

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
native apps on desktop platforms have

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,960
been

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,040
you know mostly demolished by the web

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
and on mobile platforms

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,400
people are pretty focused on the

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,960
attention economy on push notifications

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,560
and gems and engagement metrics

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,880
so i think we can do better right

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,680
we can embrace all of these local first

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,800
ideals

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,839
and and build tools that

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,599
make it more possible to think

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:53,760
to think deeper to solve hard problems

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,800
to contribute more to you know the

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,640
challenges that face us all today

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,400
and it's not to say that you know if we

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,560
solve this local first

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,760
problem that you know magically society

00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,119
will be better we'll still have all

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,480
kinds of problems we still have climate

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,359
catastrophes and

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,160
you know the rise of fascism and you

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,599
know also

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,920
whatever you know your computer is still

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,680
going to be slow but it is a piece of

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,400
the puzzle and i think it can help if we

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,960
pursue these and unblock these problems

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,319
so there's a lot more to do there's a

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,240
lot more going on

00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,200
i hope that you'll take on some of these

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,280
challenges and and join us in doing that

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,119
and that's what i came here to share

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,280
with you we have

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,200
essays online there's code online you

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,560
can contact me by email you can find me

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,440
on twitter and github

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,280
and uh thanks all for uh coming on this

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,400
journey with me and

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,400
yeah i'd love to take your questions

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,520
fantastic uh peter thank you so much

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,560
that was

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,040
excellent um uh

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,800
a quick note uh will the slides be

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,960
shared and or recording these

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
uh be available yes it will be on

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,440
github's youtube

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,200
uh in a day or two after i managed to

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,560
turn the cranks and operate all the

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,839
post-processing things

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,200
um um peter there's

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,240
so much uh stuff in this and um

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,960
uh it was as has forecasted a look at

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,760
the future

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,720
through the lens of of history but the

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,319
um

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,319
the sort of the the first questions that

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,200
jump out at me is you talk about local

00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,640
first

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,000
as being one piece of this puzzle

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,280
what do you think the other like you

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,319
know sort of like area codes of puzzle

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,640
are out there towards um making tools

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,359
that

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,599
aid thought that make a computing

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,560
environment that's less hostile

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,280
as you say to to focus thinking yeah i

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,000
mean

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
uh these are other active areas at the

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,160
lab and

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,160
in plenty of businesses uh

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,359
the the raskin family uh jeff and later

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,319
aza have been writing about

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,520
humane computing for years um you know

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,520
brett victor likes to

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,640
talk about how you know we have these

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,960
bodies

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,800
uh but all we ever do is like hold up

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,560
little like black rectangles in front of

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,040
our faces and paw at glass

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,800
no that's no good we need computers that

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,400
embody physical space dynamic land has

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,480
been exploring a lot of

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,599
like how we can expand computers beyond

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
the bounds of these little glass

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,640
rectangles

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,160
um they're not the only ones we think

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,760
stylist computing is really important

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,839
we think alternative input methods are

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,680
really important we think that

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,960
um you know tactile interfaces are

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,480
really important one of the things

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,079
that's really cool with the muse app

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,319
which spun off of

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,000
a bunch of our work at the lab is that

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,000
it sort of spatializes your thought

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,599
and then it's designed for people with

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,319
hands you know not for people with

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,359
cursors

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,040
so you can use the pen and

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,480
simultaneously use your hand to move

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,920
things around on the canvas

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,680
or you can move several things at once

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,760
if you touch several things at once it's

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,040
it's not kind of oriented to this like

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,040
you know oh

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,880
you know sketch pad literally had a

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,640
light pen and ever since then we've been

00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,599
following that exact input paradigm

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,359
there's one

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,040
you know xy coordinate and if you want

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,599
more what's your problem

00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,079
uh so yeah that's that's a couple of the

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,839
areas

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,680
another big one is you know we talk

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:11,040
about amplification of the mind a big

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,599
part of that is

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,200
you know computational thinking um excel

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,119
is always held up as kind of the gold

00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,559
standard here which is that it exposes

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,640
computation to

00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,960
a broader audience of non-computers i'm

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,240
very skeptical of the low code no code

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,160
movement generally

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,760
because i think you know it's like

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,440
focused in the wrong place which is like

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
programming is not the problem thinking

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,920
is and so we need to root ourselves in

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,760
like what are the tasks that scientists

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,520
journalists authors

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,559
you know creative musicians artists

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,119
need um but it's a start

00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,160
it could be that that you know the the

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,559
true low code

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,839
no code is actually just a synonym for

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,640
for excel and

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,280
maybe we need a corollary to at wood's

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,280
law

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,880
you know uh instead of anything that can

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,319
be written in javascript will be written

00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,000
in javascript anything that can be

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,960
written as like an excel function

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,319
eventually will be written as code is i

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,400
mean excel is a coding

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,839
environment right it's just the word

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,079
code is this like

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,079
and the word programming have taken on

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,240
this pejorative tone i think

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,359
you know there's a literacy issue here

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,280
which is i think that

00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,720
we need better languages and better

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,400
tools but

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,839
also symbolic manipulation of concepts

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,520
is sort of the point that's modeling

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,359
right the map is not the territory

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,280
you build a model of an environment of a

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,800
problem and then you interact with it

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,880
i think the issue now is that our tools

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,720
are poor not that we should be

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,520
do away with the tools but that we need

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,520
humane tools

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,440
right sorry i'm i'm restoring sharing

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,319
links yes the museum links

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,920
that the overzealous uh bot that i don't

00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:51,440
know how to like reign in

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,640
is destroying faster than that i can uh

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,319
flag a flag in um

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,079
another thing that you you touched on

00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,599
that i think was really interesting is

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,960
you talked about real-time collaboration

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,319
around software

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,680
um and um specifically around the the

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:10,880
creative act and i can think of of of

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,000
exactly one real-time collaboration

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,040
paradigm which is the the

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,559
google docs or vs code live share

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,800
like i have multiple insertion points um

00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,640
uh and that's that's definitely real

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,880
time and it's definitely collaborative

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,760
yeah you can break things very quickly

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,960
yeah exactly

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:32,880
it's highly efficient uh writing of of

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,800
of bugs um but um

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,319
what are some other uh paradigms that

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,680
you think might

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,680
represent collaborative creation

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,920
in the in the concept of coding i mean

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,839
maybe maybe this also ties into the

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,760
the previous question of you know what

00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,440
is low code no code what is actually the

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,040
boundary there is it like you know

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,720
as soon as you know what a variable is

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,800
that's it it's code like

00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,480
so i think that the fundamental problem

00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,720
with our programming systems and why

00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,760
many of these designs are failures is

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,119
that they're built

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,319
on the wrong abstraction

00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:10,000
git operates on the in

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:12,000
in the 1970s multix was face planting

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,920
uh you know its uptime was measured in

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,880
milliseconds using an oscilloscope

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,280
uh and so the unix project was born as a

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,359
pun

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,119
on multix i think actually multics was

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,400
sutherland in fact going back to our

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,960
history lesson here if anyone in the

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,000
chat

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,440
remembers better than me they can

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,160
correct me i'm sorry i'm speaking out of

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,520
school here

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,160
but unix thompson and and and kernigan

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,800
and richie

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,000
and that crew they were so frustrated by

00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
this experience that they were like oh

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,599
we're gonna do something really simple

00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,800
and the unix mentality everything is a

00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,520
file well what's a file

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,520
a file is an array data structure it is

00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,119
newline delimited arrays

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:50,000
of lines and the lines are

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,640
the type of the data in those lines is

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,640
uh

00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,400
characters which as we've learned over

00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,800
the years is a very complicated thing

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,640
that

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,640
involves a lot of different unicode code

00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,760
points and and formats and so on

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,440
anyway the unix mindset is that okay

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,000
well everything's just these arrays of

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,400
strings

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,839
cool fine we'll build tools that operate

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,920
on that data structure and git

00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,880
operates on that data structure but your

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,160
code

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,319
is not an array of strings it's a

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,520
it's a tree structure it's a graph

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,760
structure it

00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,760
you have call points you can't rename a

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,680
function and have something else

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
follow that and so i think there are a

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,160
number of people doing really

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,480
interesting work in this space

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,760
ravi choose lab and sketch and sketch at

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,240
the university of chicago

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,520
are exploring different kinds of editors

00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,680
and representations

00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,680
the dark programming language is looking

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,359
at like just a whole different paradigm

00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,800
for what software looks like it's it's

00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,319
very sas but it's also

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,079
you know exploring a lot of these things

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,640
if you represent the code not as these

00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,559
like

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,720
linear ordered bytes you know the array

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,720
of strings but in a more rich

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,800
way then you can do a lot more you can

00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,400
see that like i could program in english

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,920
and you could program in french and we

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,960
would just have translation tables that

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,839
could be the same

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,680
you know underlying system right so like

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,720
there's a lot of opportunity if we can

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,319
transcend that representation of code i

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,839
also think that the work that the unison

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,559
language is doing is really interesting

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,599
where

00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,040
every uh function's true name right you

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,280
have a pet name which is what you call

00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,520
it

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,559
but the true name of function is the

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,760
hash

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,040
of its um of its code and so when you

00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,079
call a function when you compile a

00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,160
function to call it

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,280
you know it's compiled down to those

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,800
things and you can distribute the

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,240
functions out to any number of computers

00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,680
you want behind the scenes

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,359
and then do like scatter gather

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,559
algorithms and if those nodes go to call

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,200
a function they don't have them they can

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,480
fetch them

00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,319
there's something really really

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,040
fascinating happening there and you know

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,319
i feel

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,000
bad because i know there are so many

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,240
exciting projects working on this stuff

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,119
and these are just a few but that's

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
maybe a little color of some of the

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,800
interesting stuff out there

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,559
yeah absolutely um i don't remember the

00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,760
name for like what's the law of like you

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,400
know you ship your org

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,000
chart but conway's law yes conway's law

00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,520
that's that's the one i never i always

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
get that mixed up with the other one

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,359
that's like you know how quickly

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,480
conversations devolve into

00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:05,520
whatever i don't know um the uh

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,119
godwin's law you know the uh

00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,400
yeah all the laws um

00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,400
uh that software right now

00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,720
as you as you as you touched on there is

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,760
is kind of about the manipulation of

00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,880
files with

00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,240
with with text inside them as the as the

00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,359
sort of the unit and that's the reason

00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,240
why we have

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,880
well that's eunuch science that's dead

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,880
basically

00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,960
i think the modern paradigm is actually

00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,319
the we have factories

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,200
which um hold giant expensive you know

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,960
software

00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,480
objects right there are these these

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,040
distant humming racks of

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,200
of chrome-plated servers in some you

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,799
know warehouse in ashburn virginia

00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,799
and the software lives there and then

00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:49,680
there's a cadre of

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,200
like miserable workers who who toil at

00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,799
their desks every day to keep those

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,760
servers from catching fire and falling

00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:56,000
over when

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,839
you know beyonce tweets or something and

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,520
then that's the software there's only

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,400
one of those and you can't touch it

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,160
and you know a product manager decides

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,480
that the star is now a heart because

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,240
that

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,079
increases engagement metrics and so your

00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,280
star is now a heart that what you have

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,359
on your computer

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,040
is also not the software it's it's just

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,040
like it's the skin

00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,799
left behind by the snake as it grows

00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,440
it's it's it's a dead thing that comes

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,119
to you

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,200
and so that's the thing that we have and

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,760
that thing talks to the real software

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,480
but it is

00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,680
it is of it it it is not the software

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,880
and i think that's really unfortunate

00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,799
one of the things i really like about

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,720
local for software is that

00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,559
you have the whole enchilada it's

00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,240
self-contained right and so if you don't

00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,160
like how it works you can change it

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,520
and if you want something better you can

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,960
you can move forward but if you like

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,640
what you've got you can keep it so it

00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,240
empowers you to make those decisions

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:46,960
that's how git works right um

00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,040
yeah uh okay i think we have time for

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,400
maybe like one or two more questions

00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,160
that i see that people have posted and

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,000
answer quickly um

00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,160
yeah it's all good where we can run a

00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,839
little bit over um

00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:02,319
so uh jay garing gehring

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,960
uh asked uh that a significant feature

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,119
of

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,319
collaborative cloud-based software is

00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,839
the ability to define

00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,440
fine-grained access roles and

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,319
permissions for who can read and write

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,720
data

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:17,520
um and he's asking here about

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,359
what does this look like in a world of

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,640
local first software how do you achieve

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,799
the same level of

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,799
of granularity and permissions while

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,240
still remaining safe and secure maybe

00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,240
it's actually easier in this in this

00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,119
sort of paradigm i'm not not sure how to

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,480
drive yeah so

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,520
so that we face a wave particle duality

00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,680
with data

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,880
right so data data is both a thing and a

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,119
place um

00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,160
and a google doc is a place right you

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
can

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,200
you can go and you can visit it and then

00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,559
someone can

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,799
can close the door and lock it and you

00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,480
can't come in you can send someone a url

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,000
and they can reach it but a google doc

00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,599
isn't the place because i can download

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,680
it and keep it on my ipad

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,040
so it's a thing so it's a thing and a

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,640
place and there's like this weird

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,359
if you've ever received an email from a

00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,960
business that uses outlook

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,640
no offense to your corporate overlords

00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,280
and you get like an email

00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,079
recovery ticket or the system is like oh

00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,920
no unsend

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,280
that email well now you're definitely

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,400
going to read that email right the cat

00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,720
is out of the bag

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,400
so the the point i'm making here is that

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,359
fundamentally information

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,440
is is not something you can take away

00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:21,040
from people it's something you can share

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,799
and so one of the core tenets of local

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,480
first software is

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,760
that you should have agency over the

00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,960
data so once you have data on your

00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,559
computer

00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,799
well it doesn't really it's not really

00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,640
coherent to say that you can't edit it

00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,160
maybe you shouldn't edit it but the real

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,599
question is not do you have permission

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,400
to edit it the question is

00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,000
does anybody care if you edit it i can

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,000
write all over the constitution but it

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,760
doesn't change the law of the land

00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,599
right and so i think the fundamental

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,000
pivot and you can produce the same

00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,240
articulations and experiences is like if

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,200
you don't want someone to know something

00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,480
don't tell them and if you don't care

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,880
what they have to say

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,000
don't listen and that's a really subtle

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,079
but important

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,839
just alteration of the primitives and it

00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,960
produces the same kind of capabilities

00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,799
right so like

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,079
you know if you have a salary system and

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,960
there's private information in the

00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,319
system

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,520
don't share that out to the computers of

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,480
people who aren't allowed to have access

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,240
to it

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,240
and then you know if they edit that data

00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:18,400
don't accept the rights right so it's

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,839
attention not permission

00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,240
is the fundamental um building block of

00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,680
of uh

00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,880
of security in that environment

00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,839
nice um let's see what else we got here

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
in the discussion repo

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:35,839
i'll call out that um this discussion

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,880
link uh is gonna stay stable so even

00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:40,000
after

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,440
um this uh uh session is over we can

00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,680
still engage in discussions on

00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,880
on the threads there i'll try and try

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,240
and answer anything that comes up in the

00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
questions i can post links if people

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,079
need them

00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,240
yeah so um bj titus

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,920
said um that he's heard jason freed of

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,680
base camp marry your thoughts about

00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,480
keeping old versions available to

00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,839
avoid messing up the the workshops or

00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,400
workflows of users

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,240
and uh given that all the different you

00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,440
know app stores only make the latest

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,920
version available

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,599
um what do you think about the shipping

00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,400
of multiple versions of software

00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,760
like muse without dramatically

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,359
increasing complexities

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,839
cambria is like you know obviously one

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,160
part of that this is a great question so

00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,680
uh

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,400
fundamentally the problem is we don't

00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,559
have the tools right we're in the

00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,680
what cambria is proposing and what we're

00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,280
trying to explore

00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,640
basically in a centralized system you

00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,359
can manage this problem with meetings

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,280
you're like

00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,799
you know what gang we're just not going

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,559
to do that data migration or we're going

00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,160
to email everybody and be like you need

00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,359
to upgrade to the new api because we're

00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,960
turning off the old one and then you

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:40,400
turn it off and it starts 500 and then

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,359
they complain until you turn it back on

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,880
for a while and then you

00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,280
turn it off next week after four more

00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,079
meetings but anyway you can't do that in

00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,640
a decentralized

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,440
world right and on some level the fact

00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,599
that you can't do that in a

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,760
decentralized world moxie marlin spike

00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,880
wrote an issue wrote an essay about how

00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,880
this basically

00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,480
makes decentralized software evolution

00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,200
impossible because your protocols ossify

00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,799
as soon as you have success

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,319
but that's not necessarily true it's

01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,680
just that we lack the infrastructure we

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,280
don't have the right tools

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,559
and so what the cambria project we did

01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,319
last summer was about was we kept

01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:13,680
running into these problems where like

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,559
you know it's really it's bad in in like

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,799
the

01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,240
sort of old school like downloaded

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,760
software case where it's like oh i'm on

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,119
the old version so i can't open the new

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,839
file okay fine

01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:25,760
upgrade but when you have people doing

01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,280
live collaboration on a document from

01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,640
different versions of the software

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,880
and they've changed the format they

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,799
speak it leads to some very annoying and

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,400
some extremely upsetting bugs

01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,839
where like both versions are constantly

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,520
trying to write the data they expect and

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,880
remove each other's data from the file

01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,480
so you don't want that so you know this

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,200
is no less a problem in centralized

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,119
systems

01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,200
right so in github if you look at the

01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,000
api response for a github issue

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,200
there's the assignee and then there's

01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,280
the assignees

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,599
field on that response as well and

01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,280
that's because back in 2016

01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,680
support for multiple assignees was added

01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,359
to the github api

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,040
but the old response was never changed

01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:05,200
because people were relying on it

01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,240
and so why is it this way right it

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,480
doesn't have to be

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,000
so the idea fundamentally behind the

01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,440
cambrio research was to say like well

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
what we need is a tool right

01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,720
much like version control systems gave

01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,000
us the ability to

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,359
like change the you know code over time

01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,280
with confidence and

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:23,040
packaging systems gave us the ability to

01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,559
rely on very specific versions of

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,440
dependencies and pull a lot of other

01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,319
code in in

01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:30,799
let's just say relatively safe ways

01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:33,200
cambria or a cambria descended tool

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,960
will allow us to have high fidelity high

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,400
quality reliable interop

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,720
between lots of different versions of

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,400
software and in fact not just sort of

01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,359
forward compatibility but also backward

01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,359
compatibility

01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:45,040
in the cambria project we showed that we

01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,760
can write these lenses which is what we

01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,000
call them

01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,599
into the document or into a place that

01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,680
older clients can read them

01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,480
and so the new documents are written in

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,160
the new format natively by new clients

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,599
but the old clients can open the data

01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,039
because there's a trail of breadcrumbs

01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,319
that say like oh you're on version one

01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,920
and it's version 10.

01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:03,280
well first you do this then you do this

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,559
then you do that and then you do that

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,039
and that gets you back to a version one

01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,640
file

01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,400
and then when they edit they write the

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,680
writes in their native format and then

01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,480
the other clients upgrade them at the

01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,960
other end

01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,760
that works pretty well now as to muse i

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,240
want to say

01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,160
muse is fantastic software it lives in

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,920
the apple's ecosystem and so it's

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,640
constrained by the way apple thinks

01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,799
about software

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,960
apple is notorious for abandoning the

01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:27,039
past i have lots of apps on my ipad

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,079
that like old games i bought years ago i

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,799
go to play them and they don't work

01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,680
anymore

01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:32,559
that just makes me so sad but it's the

01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,319
nature of

01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,680
it's the nature of the ecosystem and you

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,960
have to play within the

01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,480
constraints of the ecosystem you're

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:43,599
given what we want is a better ecosystem

01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,000
right um yeah i mean muse is one of

01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
those

01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,200
one of those pieces of software that

01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,720
that has tempted me repeatedly to

01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,760
actually get an ipad and a pencil

01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,799
because it looks

01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,720
so fun just also purely on the zoomable

01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,240
user interface aspect but also the

01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,480
bringing in of the like you know

01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,440
two-handed tablet computing which i

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,839
think is is

01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,839
is rare and interesting um

01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:11,359
kafka with a c with two c's

01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,640
um asks what other tools do you think

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,319
knowledge workers are missing right now

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,599
that can be made better as distributed

01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:18,079
software i mean

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,039
you've talked about about the

01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,160
collaboration

01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,799
on the writing of software and even

01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,559
cambria

01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,079
i think sort of the central conceit

01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,720
there is really about merging

01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,520
right because if i'm collaborating with

01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,920
other people

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,039
through git on software so long as we

01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,559
don't have conflicts

01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,640
in principle i don't really need git

01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,079
it's just i i push you push

01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,559
and so long as like we're not touching

01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,599
the same files it's okay it's really

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:46,079
only comes into play or sort of we need

01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:48,079
more more safety nets as soon as there's

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,119
a chance that you and i are going to be

01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:54,079
making uh conflicting changes

01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,880
um so i don't know if that's sort of

01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,400
maybe a

01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,720
um a lens to look at you know

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,960
knowledge workers work on knowledge

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,520
maybe is it around conflicts i'm i'm not

01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,599
sure i'm

01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,559
posing uh i would take it a little

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,000
different direction

01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:12,240
so um we have

01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,520
a real paucity of tools and and it's

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,720
sort of funny

01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:19,440
um you know i have a lot of love and

01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,720
appreciation for rome and notion and you

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,079
know all the folks building you know air

01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,520
table and tools like that

01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,319
i think they're good but they're they

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,599
occupy like a relatively narrow slice of

01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,119
the total knowledge production

01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,960
space um and you know

01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,319
i use those products all the time i use

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,039
github all the time but none of them

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,760
actually really fulfill these um

01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,039
requirements

01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,400
i i see um but in terms of

01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,319
where there's opportunity i think

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,720
there's opportunity at every point

01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:49,839
from um a knowledge repository building

01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,319
which is to say like

01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:54,079
good ideas come from other good ideas so

01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,640
you need to have uh

01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,440
great access to the all of the ideas

01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,760
that are the

01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,359
raw material of thought so we need

01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,520
better tools for collecting thought

01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,920
you can't save web pages it doesn't work

01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,440
pdfs are these terrible opaque format

01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,119
you know scholarly journals are locked

01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,119
behind paywalls the

01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,559
apps like zotero and so on that manage

01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:15,760
these things they're like

01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,599
okay ish you know so all that stuff has

01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,799
opportunity for improvement commonplace

01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,119
books and everything

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,000
then the next stage which is like you

01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,359
know this

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,799
is the thing that was the star in the

01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,839
graph that's like drink a lot of coffee

01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,240
take some long baths

01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:28,960
it's like something happens right

01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,799
between

01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,160
you got a bunch of ideas and data and

01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,839
then at the end there's a journal paper

01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,559
and you gotta like write latex

01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:37,359
but that center space has a lot of like

01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,440
rumination

01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,599
and contemplation and conversation and

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,079
collaboration and synthesis

01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,359
and so muse is designed to work in that

01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,440
place

01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,880
and to support that kind of ideation but

01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,599
i think there's a lot of opportunity to

01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,920
improve

01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,440
data exploration idea connection all

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,799
that kind of stuff

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,240
and part of the problem is like a lot of

01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,839
these tools operate as silos so they're

01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,359
quite closed and don't allow

01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,440
like collaboration with other tools and

01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:02,079
outside sources so i think that's part

01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,520
of the issue

01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,960
and then the final process which is

01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,400
actually like getting data out into the

01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,119
world and like talking about it and

01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,640
sharing it

01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,160
you know we've got you know google

01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,640
slides and we've got

01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,520
latex and and overleaf and all these

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,039
kinds of things

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,559
but they're all again there's huge

01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,319
opportunity both for improvement in

01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,520
integration and collaboration

01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:22,400
and durability and performance and user

01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,000
experience

01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,520
so i think you could pick almost any

01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,799
point in this process whether it's tools

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,119
for musicians or

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:31,039
artists or journalists right like the

01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,960
new york times needs better text editors

01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,680
to do a better job of their journalism

01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,599
d3 is pretty good but like you know

01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,039
there's a lot of improvement opportunity

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,000
in how we visualize data for

01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,680
communication of it

01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,960
you can pick any point here and cut in

01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,520
and there's loads to do once you start

01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,799
to

01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,599
think about it nice okay we have one

01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,280
last question

01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,640
and that is uh what do you see is the

01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,359
path to

01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,520
widespread marketplace adoption of these

01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:58,480
areas like what's standing between

01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,319
us and this this uh this uh this rose

01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,559
rose tainted future

01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,559
uh

01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,760
you can't so two things one is

01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,440
people will do the easy thing i use

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,799
google slides not some

01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,079
weird local first thing i guess i could

01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,880
use keynote but i'm on a windows machine

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,640
these days

01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,799
um keynote is actually a good example of

01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,839
like a pretty darn credible local first

01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:23,599
application where

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,119
it has like a strong client it has a

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,559
good web application and it does data

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,119
sync across all your devices

01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,559
kudos to apple for that one but so i

01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,000
think the short answer is like we need

01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,760
better tooling and infrastructure so a

01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,839
lot of what we think about at the lab is

01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,119
like

01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:42,720
unblocking this work

01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,119
and in a big way i think if we get it

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,319
right

01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,000
it will happen automatically because

01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:50,079
and by we i don't mean assetting can

01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,280
switch i mean you who are watching

01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:57,039
uh it will happen automatically because

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,039
you know like ruby on rails spawned

01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,200
literally millions of new kinds of

01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,240
applications you know from

01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,599
like toys and games to like election

01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,160
monitoring

01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,359
you know software all of that came out

01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,640
of this like

01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,640
empowerment that came with these

01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,799
libraries but the problem with web

01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,920
applications is they don't scale

01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,359
you know people like oh it scales to

01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,279
millions of users it only scales to

01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,120
millions of users because somebody

01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,319
is spending a lot of money and staying

01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,359
up late at night

01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:27,279
right word star everybody on the planet

01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,040
can install an old ms-dos simulator and

01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,080
run that old copy of word star and no

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,440
one is gonna

01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,799
no one's gonna get woke up at three in

01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,839
the morning because of it well actually

01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,719
somebody's gonna get woke up because

01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,159
they'd be like why is they ever doing a

01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,520
word style this is weird they're gonna

01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:38,880
lie awake think about it but like

01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,159
technically no one's getting there's no

01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,759
ops burden to this

01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,440
and local first software can eliminate

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:44,799
ops burden which means that if you want

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,440
to make software

01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:48,799
you can make one piece of software and

01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,480
everyone can use it

01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:53,120
and it won't wake you up and it won't

01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:54,880
cost you a dime

01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,960
think about that you could build a

01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,719
business you could build a business

01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:02,159
used by billions without spending a dime

01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,679
in ops costs and without

01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:05,679
getting woken up at three in the morning

01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,159
by like an outage so i think that that's

01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,640
like

01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:09,440
a very compelling economic argument and

01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,960
so you know

01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,159
people do things when they're easier and

01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,960
when they're cheaper when they're better

01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:14,319
so that's part of it

01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,719
the other thing is i think that this

01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,400
model will lead to

01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,839
this model of software could lead to new

01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,600
economic models and i think if you look

01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,279
at the history of

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,640
the software industry and investment if

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,359
you go back to the shareware

01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,960
like part of what we do is look at the

01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,040
broadest possible scope of

01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,400
of technology and so if you look at the

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,480
history of computers in the beginning

01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,799
software only existed as

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,239
um a bundle in with your multiple

01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,759
million dollar hardware

01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:41,120
and so stallman's like open source

01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,319
movement is like a weird kind of

01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,560
reaction to like

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,520
military funding for like enterprise

01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,679
hardware

01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,799
um but then over time it was like but i

01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,640
want to make money doing this

01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,480
for me and so people were putting you

01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,080
know mark benioff got to start putting

01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,760
video game floppy disks

01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,679
into ziploc bags and mailing them to

01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,760
people right and that was the shareware

01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,679
movement

01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,960
and mark benioff's games are you can see

01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,840
them on youtube it's kind of funny to

01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,239
like think that

01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,920
you know he was like some teenager in a

01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:09,840
you know garage somewhere making games

01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,040
and mailing them out to people

01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,120
back in the old days there's no idea

01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,960
about this yeah very cool this is this

01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,120
is the first thing i'm doing after this

01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,360
uh but but my point is that you know

01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,960
these the the model today is like sas

01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,239
subscription businesses and subscription

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,199
business is a really good way to run

01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:25,040
your company

01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,120
but like paying every month is not a

01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,239
great way to consume software that sucks

01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,159
for the user and so i think we're going

01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,840
to need to find new models that make it

01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,840
economically compelling to build great

01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,120
software this way i think that's not

01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,719
you know people will just start charging

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,239
money and once you figure it out will

01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,640
get rich

01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:42,080
so you know my advice to anyone trying

01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,640
to build this is like just

01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,239
pretend it's a sas and optimize it like

01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,280
a sass and tell people it's a sass and

01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:49,600
then just run it locally on their

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,760
computer and see if anybody cares

01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,640
right i mean i can't help it but think

01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,440
about sort of

01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:57,040
two there i think there's an implicit

01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,000
thing hiding inside what you're saying

01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,080
which is

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,280
um a very strong vote for

01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,080
um uh the web as opposed to

01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,679
uh the various like wild software

01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,840
gardens because

01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,679
um the web is also the problem though

01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,520
right right the web

01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,880
web applications and sas businesses take

01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,080
the software out of your hands and lock

01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,520
it up somewhere and then you don't even

01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,960
have the data right like i go to a

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,960
recipe site when i leave i don't even

01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,640
have the recipe

01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,000
right but i mean i can't i can't

01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,199
actually do a local first

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,400
app in in in apple's like

01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,800
wild garden because they'll be like show

01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,199
me

01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,960
the app and you're like no it's it

01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,080
depends and there's multiple versions

01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,640
and they might want to talk to one

01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,280
another

01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,760
like you still need to to live with um

01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,239
their

01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,480
approval of your software i think a

01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:49,199
robust local first solution will be

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,560
not it will it has to fuse the benefits

01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,920
of both i think there's a lot of great

01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,280
things about the web right like it's

01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,000
global distribution

01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,080
it's you know it's accessible the old

01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,560
sort of geocities web is closer where

01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,280
like

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,400
more of the code was in the thing that

01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,840
you downloaded

01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,760
um i think that stuff is important i

01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,520
think browsers could really improve pwas

01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,080
and local storage support and file

01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,920
support

01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,520
that would be huge just across the board

01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,280
in terms of unblocking this

01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,800
but also browsers are just slow it takes

01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,400
forever to render a web page

01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,000
i mean you know this you done you look

01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,600
at a performance profile on a web

01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,480
application it's awful

01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,280
run in 60 frames a second you know like

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,960
if you can't run

01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,880
60 frames per second the amount of

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,880
effort oh god i've spent

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,480
months of my life just like chasing

01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,120
request animation frame

01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,880
oh terrible but yeah so i think that's

01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,000
part of the argument for why mobile apps

01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,360
are so good is that

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,960
the hardware is good and because of

01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,960
their low power environments they really

01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,199
focus on performance and experience

01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,640
so i think plus because they're isolated

01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,600
from the internet right like

01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,440
i have concerns about the app model and

01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,440
the lack of agency and having computers

01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,960
you can't actually program on

01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,000
but they get a lot of the pieces right

01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,440
and so what we want is to bring the

01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,719
pieces that work together in a way that

01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,320
empowers users and creates better

01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,640
software

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,760
fantastic uh peter thank you so much

01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,800
this has been a

01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,159
fantastic discussion um uh i really

01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,480
appreciate you coming over and

01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,520
and giving us both the history lesson

01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,880
and the um

01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:14,480
the forward-looking uh thing um

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,000
oh what is the minimum software

01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,679
requirements around this i'm going to

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
copy and paste that question into the

01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,719
thread

01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,760
because we are all already quite overdue

01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:25,040
to hand it over to

01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,400
b dougie who's going to be uh up next on

01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,920
on twitch tv slash github um

01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,000
thanks so much for coming everyone

01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,400
please uh keep the discussion going in
