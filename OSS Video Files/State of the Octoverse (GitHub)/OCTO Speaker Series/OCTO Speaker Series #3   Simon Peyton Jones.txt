Description: 
	Computer Science Meets Education, at Scale

The UK is in the throes of a wholesale reform of school (K-12) education in computing, one that establishes computer science as a foundational discipline that all children learn from primary school onwards, just as they do maths and natural science. It’s pretty exciting: I will sketch the context and describe our progress.

But I will focus on one particularly exciting development: Project Quantum. So-called “diagnostic questions” are multiple choice questions that promote learning (rather than measurement). But it’s hard to know which ones work well, and which don’t. In partnership with an ed-tech startup (Eedi) we now have hundreds of millions of data points and are beginning to apply both statistics (Rasch analysis) and machine learning (variational autoencoders) to distilling insights from this data.

About Simon Peyton-Jones
I fell in love with functional programming when I was 20, and I am still in love today. I helped design Haskell, and I spend a lot of time on GHC, Haskell's most widely-used compiler (including inside GitHub).

I got involved in education because I was dissatisfied with the computing education my children experienced. It has turned out to be much more rewarding than I expected, and I hope to share some of that excitement in my talk.

[Music]

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,960
hello everybody

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,440
welcome to this webinar organized by the

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,840
office of the cto at github

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,439
today it's my pleasure to introduce

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,720
simon peyton jones

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,640
if you have touched functional

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
programming you will already know of

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,960
simon

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
he is one of the primary contributors to

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,439
the design of the haskell programming

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
language

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,680
and the lead implementer of the glorious

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,760
glasgow haskell compiler

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,840
ghc this work is characterized by taking

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
deep theoretical insights

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960
applying them to amazing practical

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,800
benefits

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
and then explaining it all with

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,719
disarming clarity and delight

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,079
originally uh due to my own personal

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,840
tastes i wanted to talk

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
about his research and delight us with

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,399
yet another nugget

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,039
of theory brought to life in dhe

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
but today he is in fact talking about a

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,680
different

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,119
but equally important topic teaching

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,680
computing to the next generation

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,400
simon shares the computing at school ca

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,159
as group

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,680
an organization which aims to promote

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
the teaching of computer science at

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
school

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,600
following these efforts in 2019 he was

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
appointed chair of the newly founded

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,360
uk national center for computing

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
education

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,439
before simon kicks off a few

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,520
housekeeping remarks

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
if you have a question at any time

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,040
during the talk

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
please use the q a feature of the go to

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,560
webinar uh

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,119
app to post this uh throughout we will

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
be

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,799
watching these questions if possible

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
simon will answer them

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,439
uh uh live immediately or we'll uh

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,880
collect them and address them

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,719
at the end so with that uh simon

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,640
over to you great thanks ugh

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
what a delight to be with you all um

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
thank you for getting up it's nine

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
o'clock in the morning for many of you

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
um it's a bright and early for you

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,200
afternoon for me ugo described this

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
topic as

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,479
equally important as haskell and

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,840
functional programming but in some ways

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
i think it's even more

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
important so with functional programming

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
i hope to reach you know

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,879
millions of programmers with education

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,879
we want to reach

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,800
every child in the country and actually

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,360
every child on the planet in due course

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
so it is really really important here is

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
the um

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,400
uh um a quick um

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
uh uh picture about where we're starting

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
um

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
what i'd like to do is to take you on a

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,599
journey this is a personal journey for

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
me

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,760
um it's been a journey for the country

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
that i live in the united kingdom

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
and i'd like to encourage you to think

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,160
it could be a journey for you and your

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
country as well and talk a little bit

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,280
about how you might get involved in this

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,959
um so here's how it started for me it

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
was around our kitchen table in around

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
2007 when these are my

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
uh three children we were talking about

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,599
the uh their school

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
what happened to school and they were

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
describing computing as a school subject

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,640
that they were doing it was then called

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
information and communication technology

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
and to my dismay they described it in

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
terms of contempt

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
they regarded as being completely

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
beneath them it was about how to use

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,080
word and powerpoint in excel and very

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,599
little else

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
so i found that i couldn't draw a

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
connection between the subject that they

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
were learning at school

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
and the subject to which i had devoted

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
my professional life because i thought

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
it was so interesting they went sort of

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,200
like this

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,480
was in biology or natural science i

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
think the kind of stuff you learn at

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,599
school is related to the stuff a

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
professional biologist or natural

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
scientist

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,280
might be involved in so that felt very

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
different so

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,560
um talking to others we ended up

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
starting a

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,200
a group called computing at school um

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
back in 2007 this was a sort of

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,000
guerrilla volunteer

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,319
group grassroots bottom up unfunded no

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
organizational structure nothing but our

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,959
idea was

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
let's try to do something about the

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
computing education that our children

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,360
are getting

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,000
so it's now very much bigger and has

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,959
proved to be quite an influential group

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
so and i'm at the honor to service it as

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
its chair still

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
um so the first thing we wanted to do in

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
kaz

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,720
was to try to say what is it that we

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
want it's not enough to criticize

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,000
what we um uh what other people have we

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,239
have to say what we

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
want what we think should be the case so

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
here's our vision

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
every child should learn computer

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
science

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,759
as a foundational discipline in the same

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,759
way they do maths and natural science

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
and that means from primary school

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
onwards

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,880
so you'll notice this is a big shift the

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
information and communication technology

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
as the subject has then was was quite

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,720
vocational in its focus it was oriented

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
around

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
technology and skills um with a with a

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,040
strong emphasis on this is a useful

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,479
thing to do whereas with natural science

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,320
we get all children to learn

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,080
a bit of physics at an elementary level

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
a bit of chemistry not because they're

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
going to become physicists or chemists

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
all of them a minority will but only a

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
small minority

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
we teach them this because we think it's

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
important to learn something about the

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,800
natural world that surrounds you

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,560
so that you can become an informed agent

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
in it have agency in the world

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
it's the same with computing if we

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
understand something about all this

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
sleek technology that's around us we'll

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
be better equipped

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,680
as citizens and a minority will go on to

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,680
be well equipped for good jobs

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,520
so there's a lot of things to unpack

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
here it's about ideas and not primarily

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
about technology

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
um from primary school onwards is

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
important but this is saying it's for

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,080
everybody

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,199
um and we're saying it's for everybody

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
it's not just for future software

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
developers it's for future brain

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
surgeons and future plumbers future

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
everybody

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
um that is a subject discipline not just

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,680
a skill we'll talk a little bit more

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
about that

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,919
um and its goal is to turn um

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,360
turn our children into informed

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,120
critics or authors of um computational

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
and technological stuff rather than

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,960
mere passive consumers of it i hope that

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
makes sense

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
as a way to frame it so it was a very

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,199
big shift from what we had before

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
so in talking about that we have to say

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,080
something about

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
what do we mean by computer science

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,039
anyway so computer science is well

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,639
established as a

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,160
university level subject but it was not

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,039
really at all well established as a

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
school subject

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
but if you say um when we think about

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
natural science we think about it as a

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
subject discipline what is the subject

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
discipline that underlies all this

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
technology well it's computer science

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,720
what is that so this is a way that i

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
found i

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
ended up explaining it that it's the

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,120
study of information

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,120
computation and communication

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
in both natural and artificial systems

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
artificial systems being computers but

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
natural systems just being like

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,919
the world that surrounds us um but

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
notice this is not technologically

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,039
oriented it's they're sort of ion words

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
rather than

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,919
databases computers and networks which

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
you might think of as being the

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,560
technological bits of

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
information computation and

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,120
communication so

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
here's a little video that gives you an

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
idea of

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
what we have in mind i show this video

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
often even you know to everybody to

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
policy

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,199
everybody from politicians to technology

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,039
people but it's helpful

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
in explaining what we're about so this

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,240
is um children doing sorting and a

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,240
sorting network drawing on a school

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
on a floor uh their primary school

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,560
children when two children meet at a box

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,599
they swap places if one number is bigger

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
than the other and they don't swap

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,000
otherwise

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
um and so this is a sorting network and

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
if they follow the rules then

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
um uh when they get to the end uh look

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
they come out sorted um and you can do

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
this kind of thing um

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,479
in an experiential way you can do it

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,360
with bigger numbers you can do with a

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
bigger network

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
you can do it as a competition here's

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
some children doing it on a school

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
playground to 40 of them

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,280
tim bell who made this video told me

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,560
that it took them the entire morning

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,919
to to um film that last 10 seconds of

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,240
video so

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,919
take another look at it another time but

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,039
i love this because

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,960
there are no computers in sight

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
there's no technology here at all and

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,759
yet

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,960
there's something very interesting and

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
intriguing going on something

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
computational and perhaps surprising

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
that this network drawn on the floor can

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
sort

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
and moreover it allows a sort of

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
experiential approach it means that

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
children can say oh well maybe the

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
teacher put us in a particular order at

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,479
the beginning

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
so that we would come out sorting let's

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
see if we can fool the teacher by

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
putting ourselves in a different order

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
at the beginning

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
and they follow the rules and they're

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,840
still sorted and then they might say

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
i wonder if every input combination will

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
lead to a sorted output and that's cause

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
a much harder question

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,000
but i love the way that a primary school

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
child could at least ask that question

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,720
and they could say could we do the same

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,919
thing with the different arrangements of

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
boxes of wires or

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
fewer boxes and wires and how do we do

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,039
it on a larger

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
um set of inputs and all of these things

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,280
are amenable to practical

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
experimentation

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,719
not just um not just their theoretical

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
reasoning

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,440
um and uh um and

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
once again no technology in sight so i

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
like that very much um

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,159
so that that's kind of like the idea

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
ideas not technology

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,640
um so here's an another example about

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,600
the way in which you're trying to

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,120
decouple computing from the idea of um

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
uh people sitting in dark

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
basements with glowing screens it's

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,040
really an interdisciplinary subject

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
here's a um a little diagram that helps

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
you generate

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
english language sentences so the rules

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
are you just put your finger on the

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,160
the dots and follow the arrows and say

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,519
the words you could say

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,959
the old clown sang

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,680
and going backwards a tiny

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
pirate laughed and then you can leave so

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
um

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
it's not long after you show this to two

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
children that they start writing

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
diagrams of their own to generate more

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,880
sentences usually rude ones

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,560
and in fact after a bit they start they

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
start

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,839
retrospectively reinventing the laws of

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
english grammar if you like in so far as

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
they're already

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,040
such laws but you and i can look at this

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,480
and we can think it's just a finite

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
state automaton we could use it to

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,240
describe a microwave often and indeed it

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
is it's a sort of computational idea

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
that's usable in all sorts of places but

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,600
you can make it surface

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
in a way that somehow relates to other

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
school subjects that's very good when

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,519
you're

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
a primary school when we don't have the

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,279
kind of very siloed effect that we get

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
in university or secondary schools

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,760
primary schools

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
really have one teacher for a class and

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,880
they teach sort of subjects kind of

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,080
shmoosh together they're very good for

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,000
that

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
so that's just a quick very very quick

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,160
sort of

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
glimpse about what computing or computer

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
science is a school subject might look

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,720
rather different to the way we think

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,240
about it as a university subject

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,920
um i think it's also helpful just to

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
sort of debunk some myths partly i'm

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,079
telling you this this is a way you can

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,440
have conversations with

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
other people about what what we're

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,519
trying to do in some ways i think you'll

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
say

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
um oh yes i understand all this course

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
of course we're doing how can we do

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,920
anything else but

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
being able to explain it is important so

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,120
myth one is that computer science is all

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
about computers and it really isn't

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
there's this famous quote from dijkstra

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,800
that computer science is noble about

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
um uh computers then astronomy is about

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
telescopes i

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,519
i like that quote it's not quite as

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
opposite for computer science as

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
as astronomy but close um and i've shown

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
you this sort of unplugged approach in

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
the um

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
uh to teaching computing in that little

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
video um

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
and i think also we can reach beyond

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,399
technology in a different way by looking

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,160
at the natural world and say

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,760
well um an ant colony has lots of little

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
little computers that's the individual

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,800
ants running very simple programs

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,160
because an ant brain is not very big

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
but somehow collectively they do

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
something that is greater than what one

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
ant could do and they somehow

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,640
cooperate even though they're running

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
quite a small program that's a very

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
strange and remarkable thing to happen

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
but it's a computational and

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
informational and communicational

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,839
phenomenon

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,880
second myth is that if you um ask the

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,000
man in the street shouldn't we you know

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,720
should we teach computing at school

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
they'd say oh

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,959
maybe yes we should we should teach

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,920
every child to code and we should

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
but it's not all about coding right it's

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,440
a very popular meme

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,959
but i want to keep a big keep us in a

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,240
bigger frame

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,720
if you like so um i think of programming

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
is to computer science in the same way

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
that lab work

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
is to physics

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
but we would never if we wanted to teach

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
child physics we wouldn't just put them

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,480
in a lab together with

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
um stopwatch and inclined planes and

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
ball bearings and expect them to

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,240
reinvent newton's laws of motion

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
um we would definitely want them to do

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
lab work because that's what brings

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
physics alive

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
right but we wouldn't we teach them some

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,040
principles as well so

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,880
um so programming is incredibly

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
important you know it's it's crucial

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
it's motivating

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,519
um everything in computer science is

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
shot through with programming but it

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
isn't the subject

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
right it's it can be seductive and even

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,240
distracting as we get sort of addicted

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
to programming and forget about the

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,320
the principles so um i'm a little bit

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
worried that in 10 years time our

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
secretary of state for education will

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
say the reform of the english national

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
curriculum has been a great success

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
all children leave school knowing how to

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,040
program in python

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,079
that would not be a good outcome so

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,639
third myth often when you start talking

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
about this

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
people will say that computer science is

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,680
not really for creative people is it

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,399
creative people

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,920
um but i love this quote from fred

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
brooks who said the program i like the

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,120
poet works only slightly removed from

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
pure

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
thought stuff she builds her castles in

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,519
the air from

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,880
air creating by exertion of the

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,920
imagination

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,839
few media of creationists so flexible so

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,079
easy to polish and rework so readily

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,320
capable of realizing grand

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
conceptual structures that's a lovely

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,200
quote fred

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,760
brooks was almost a poet himself

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
i think so programming itself is

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
intensely creative every program is a

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
new thing something

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,160
nobody's done before and in fact um

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,440
the medium of our creation is so

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,440
powerful and so flexible

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
really the main thing that limits is our

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,920
own ability inability to grapple with

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,839
complexity

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,959
if you build a skyscraper out of steel

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
that comes to a point where if you build

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,680
it any higher it just falls down but

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,279
steel isn't strong enough

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
that's not really true of software it's

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,440
our own inadequacies that stop us

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,800
building bigger programs that's quite a

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,079
um quite a challenge

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,959
um so i i really like this um this

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
berkeley-based

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,680
uh computer science course called the

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
beauty and joy of computing because i

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,839
think it puts the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
the emphasis in the right place

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,079
fourth thing um a good computing

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,279
education is all about

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,720
good jobs particularly geeky jobs um

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,560
i don't think so i think it's mainly

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
about understanding the world

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,600
understanding the world and being

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,440
equipped for life um

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,959
more generally it will equip you for

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,279
geeky jobs as well

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,720
um but it'll also equip you for jobs in

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
completely different subjects

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
um and uh just for being an empowered

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
citizen so

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
um and the other thing to remember is

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
there's always a danger that will train

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,399
people for today's jobs not for

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
tomorrow's jobs

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
so that's the stuff about teaching

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,040
people subject disciplines

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,279
is that that's stuff that doesn't date

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,360
quickly it lasts a long time it's useful

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,800
as successive waves of technology roll

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,240
through that's our ambition

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
it's not to teach children about one

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,920
wave of technology but about the

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,279
give them the intellectual scaffolding

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,760
and toolbox that will enable them to

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,440
grapple with successive waves

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,800
so i think of the picture like this that

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,839
there's a there's a sort of

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,399
two two pillars to this there's

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
the educational drive which says

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,279
computer science is a foundational

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,079
subject discipline that every child

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,240
should learn

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,399
because it'll equip them for life but

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,839
also there's a more instrumental pillar

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
which is that it's a subject that will

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,480
equip our children for jobs of the

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
future actually not just computer

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
science jobs but lots and lots of

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,360
different kinds of jobs

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,959
and these two pillars solidly underpin

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,959
computer science as a school subject

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,079
so that was the vision that we um

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,880
articulated

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,560
and but it's easy when you sort of talk

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
with these big pictures together

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,279
to lose track of the um that you know

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,279
what what happens on the ground i just

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,800
want to give you a little encouraging

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,959
vignette of something that happened this

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
was now about um five years ago i think

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,399
this particular

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,120
occasion in which a this is miles berry

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
who's a

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,880
uk educational um computing educational

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,880
person who gave a workshop in london

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
in which um uh he was teaching some

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,199
children about scratch

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,959
and there was they were primary school

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,360
children in fact um

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
and this um this girl em realized that

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,320
she could replace

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,920
uh the repeated steps of this little

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
turtle program to draw square

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,680
with a little for loop nobody taught her

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
about four loops you just saw that in

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
the

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
the palette of things you could do it

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,920
you did a bit of guessing and so i'm

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
experimenting

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,600
notice how experimental all of this is

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,880
right and

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,959
she was able to write a for loop that

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,079
did the same thing and then she was so

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,519
pleased about this she told her

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,240
colleagues in the in the little group

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,120
that she was in

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
um and that gave quite a boost to her

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
self-confidence

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
and this is what her teacher wrote to

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,160
miles

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
some weeks later here i have m

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
self-esteem going through the roof and

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
she has associated this computing

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,040
success

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
with that over the last couple of weeks

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,240
she solved maths problem after problem

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,920
met target after target she's truly

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
flying

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,600
c is going great because of a positive

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
experience in a confusing workshop in

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,040
london

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,399
and i love this because it's sort of i

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,320
find it quite touching

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,000
actually because it i feel this is what

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,519
it's all about this is about giving

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
our children perhaps quite young

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,759
children a sense of self-worth and

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,560
self-efficacy and agency and ability to

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,160
do things

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,759
that perhaps some of them had not felt

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
before and this is going to be

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,480
more pronounced for some children than

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,600
others but for some it will be really

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,400
quite pronounced i think probably for

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
many people

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,039
um listening to this talk i hope that um

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,240
you know computing has been a way to

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,919
um you know to change the world to uh to

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,919
be a um a personal vocation

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,160
okay so uh back to back to the uk

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
journey then so we

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
we can sort of articulated this then we

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
got lucky that

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,039
um there was a reform of the entire

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,039
national curriculum in england

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,799
um so at that moment the department of

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,520
education was kind of up for

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
up for input about what education in all

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,600
subjects should look like and we were

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
able to say well

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,960
this is what we think computing

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
education should be like um the royal

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,039
society

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,240
um founded by uh isaac newton it's a

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,480
sort of um big big big noise um

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,679
uh scientific society in england and

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,360
it's the important thing is it's one

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,000
that the government listens to

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,679
um they published a very influential

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
report in 2012 called shut down a

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,120
restart

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
the the case for computing education in

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,679
school it's readily available just um

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,200
google on that title then there was a

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,240
working group to write a new curriculum

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
and in the end the department of

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
education outsourced writing the new

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,039
curriculum to a working group which

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
was i was lucky enough to share and the

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
new curriculum was published and

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
launched in 2014.

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,880
um so here in fact is the um

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,160
this new curriculum the the um

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,760
constraint was they said well you say

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,919
what you like simon but it all has to

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,280
fit on two sides of a4

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
so here is the beginning of the two

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,520
sides of a4 and this is the national

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
curriculum in england for computing and

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
it says

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
every child this is from six through to

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
16 should be able to understand and

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
apply

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,280
the fundamental principles and concepts

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,720
of computer science

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,720
should be able to analyze problems in

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,480
computational terms and have repeated

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,720
experience of writing programs to solve

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,919
such problems this is in black and white

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,360
in uk's um

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,039
national curriculum i'm very proud of

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,880
this because i think it's very um it's

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,840
very unequivocal about our aspiration

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,280
what we're trying to do

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,200
um

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,559
uh okay but we haven't lost track of

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
using so it's important as well have

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,880
been

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
to be able to use computers confidently

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,120
and competently and that's those are the

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
last two books you'll see on this slide

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,720
okay nobody has typed in icon looking at

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
the questions panel i'm not a single one

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
so you

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
don't don't just sit there um uh think

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,280
about what's going on here so

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,720
backing up then um you could 2014 so

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
what happens when you quickly it's only

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
two sides of a4 how do we turn that into

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,880
reality well

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,720
there was a lot of paddling under the

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
water um

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,840
and then the royal society produced

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,320
another report in 2017

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
and around a response to that report the

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
government recognized that they needed

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,160
to

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,760
offer some training to teachers because

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,080
of course teachers were not trained

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,799
to teach computer science um they just

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
weren't

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,320
very very few of them had computer

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,840
science degrees um and

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,679
computer science as a school subject was

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,559
entirely new as a school subject so

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
that was a so the government then agreed

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,559
to fund

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
the national center for computing

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,679
education which i'll say a little bit

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
more about insects so here it is

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
what is the national center it's an 80

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,760
million pound four-year program starting

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,640
about 2019

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
to train and support uh teachers to

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,760
teach

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,200
um compute computing so computing is

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
meant to embrace both computer science

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,799
and the more applied aspects

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,720
um as a school subject from uh in

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,679
primary school and secondary school

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,799
um across er you know in every school in

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,159
every part of the land and there are a

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,360
lot of schools so we're talking about

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,280
three and a half thousand secondary

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,400
schools sixteen thousand primary schools

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,840
and six million children

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,960
that's a lot um so the national center

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
is a you know

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,640
it's a huge enterprise and it's done

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,159
doing a ton of stuff i'm not going to

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
tell you in great detail what all that

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,159
stuff is

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
um uh because um there's other things to

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,120
get to

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,880
um as well but it's um i'm i service his

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
non-executive chair still my day job is

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
still

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,640
uh functional programming and research

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,559
at microsoft in this and machine

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
learning but by my i have a sort of um

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,240
uh night job as it were to be chair of

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,760
the ncc which i love

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
um so just to pause for a moment and

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,679
take stock

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,400
what's happened so it really is amazing

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,480
that in only 10 years it's been

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
quite a long time but still now i'm 60 i

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,760
realize that 10 years quite short

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,159
actually in educational terms

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,760
we've articulated a new vision of what a

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,080
good computing education might like

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
we've

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,600
built a community of practice a

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,840
grassroots community of teachers

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
who are you know collectively more and

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,679
more buying into this vision

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,440
we got established in national

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,559
legislation actually a new policy

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,559
that embodied that vision

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
that really establishes a completely new

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,360
school subject namely computer science

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,320
which was firmly established at

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,159
university but not at all at school

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
and we got the national center for

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,640
computing education established as a

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,039
professional development program so

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
you will know that when if you ever go

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
hill-climbing that whenever you walk up

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
a hill

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
or climb a mountain when you get to the

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,919
top of it what do you see you see bigger

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
mountains

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,120
behind um so turning all this aspiration

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
and joy into

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,880
an actual vibrant reality in every

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
classroom is not easy

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,720
right there are a lot of classrooms

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,440
there are a lot of teachers um

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,039
so um and even 80 million pounds which

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
sounds like a lot of money

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,600
isn't all that much if you divide it by

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,039
the number of schools in the time it's

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,880
only a thousand pounds per school per

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,080
year enough to buy you know

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,960
a couple of laptops so uh it is not a

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,440
lot of money

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,159
um but it is hugely more than zero and

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,760
we can do a lot with it

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,360
um so i've had cause over the last ten

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
years to talk to a lot of teachers

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,679
um and my respect for them as a

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,559
profession goes up every time i do so

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,080
teachers are actually amazing um being a

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,440
teacher is pretty hard you get pulled in

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
all sorts of directions

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
and being a computing teacher is

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,320
actually quite a bit harder particularly

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
in computing because it's in so much

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
flux essentially we're introducing a

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,960
massive step

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,799
change into the subject that they teach

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
and we're asking them to as well change

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,120
the wheels on the bus while the bus is

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,120
still going along

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,679
they can't say no school for two years

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,840
we're going to figure this out

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,840
their children are arriving in september

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
computing is a very young subject right

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
we don't we have uh

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,679
centuries of experience about how to

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,840
teach maths at school but we have

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,919
you know a few years experience only

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,720
about how to teach computing at school

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,000
uh or computer sciences school so just

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,960
how do you do it best

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,320
that's um uh that's that's quite hard we

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,000
don't know and that's hard for teachers

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
qualifications are changing and there's

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,880
a big shortage of teachers as well so as

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,559
one teacher put it

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
um when she was talking to me about this

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,120
she said

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,799
in my school it's me me or me um and i

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,880
feel that sort of sense of

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,440
uh kind of not exactly loneliness but

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,080
the sense of

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,799
not she clearly didn't feel she was

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
living in a

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,400
system with a web of support and that's

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
what i hope the ncc and cas will help to

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,480
do

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,159
uh there's a question um thank you um

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,360
william but question about abstraction i

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,480
think i think i'll i think i will come

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,080
to that at the end

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,919
um but yes uh

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,440
um yes i'll come to us at the end good

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,960
thank you keep keep asking

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,440
um so so i want to

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,640
give you the sense of a lot has happened

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
and it's very exciting

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
but huge challenges still to turn it

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,480
into reality

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,080
so the question i then want to ask all

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,120
of us as computing professionals

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,720
is well how can we help um and i want to

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,039
answer that in two ways i wanted to give

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
you

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,400
i want to describe to you um a

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,760
particular project that

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,559
i'm involved in uh here at um with uh

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,279
here at microsoft um which i'm enjoying

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,720
a lot

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,760
um and um and then zoom out of it and

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,520
talk about what else might we do so

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,400
here's the particular project um that

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,799
i'm involved in

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
at um microsoft called project quantum

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,720
so

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,360
here's the question how can we help

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,880
teachers

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
in a tangible in a concrete actionable

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,080
but scalable way one that will work

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,120
across lots of teachers

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,720
so one particular thought is this all

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
teachers need to track the progress

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
their students make

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
and if they've got a few dozen students

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
they can do that kind of by the seat of

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
their pants when they've got a few

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,880
hundred

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600
um as many teachers have across the big

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,200
school

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
they are going to need to be somewhat

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,039
more systematic about it so what they do

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,200
is

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,120
they inevitably produce tests or quizzes

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,799
and where do they get those tests or

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
quizzes from well

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
mostly they write them themselves and

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
that's absurd right it's incredibly

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
duplicative because they're

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,640
writing themselves also writing good

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,480
quizzes is hard writing good questions

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,240
is a difficult skill

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,600
and it's particularly difficult if

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,080
you're not an expert in the subject

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,480
which our teachers are largely not

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,480
so an obvious suggestion would be to

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
offer a corpus of high quality questions

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,080
that teachers could then draw on to save

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
them time but also give them access to

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
higher quality questions

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
so the way that's typically done is by

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,559
paying experts

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,760
to write questions and then field

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,440
trialing those questions to find out

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,960
which ones work well

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
and that's quite expensive and tends to

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,480
lead to a smallish corpus of questions

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,000
when it's almost irresistible to then

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
monetize that in some way

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,159
not what we really want here so another

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,520
possibility which i was talking to some

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,720
assessment experts and they've begun to

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,400
think about this already is to

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
crowdsource the questions so

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
maybe we could build this is in the in

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,039
the spirit of an open open source

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
software

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,159
instead of closed source software we'll

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
pay somebody to write it and then it's

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,880
ours

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,559
we'll use open source um this case open

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,400
source uh questions we'll

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,880
we'll get um anybody to write questions

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,080
and contribute them um and and share all

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,799
the questions that other people have

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,279
written

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,240
um so and not only that we'll share all

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,000
the data

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
from the answers that students give to

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,120
them um in an anonymized form

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,440
to educational researchers anywhere

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,880
so if this worked this would be not just

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
the uk the same corpus could work

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
anywhere in the world and not just

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,880
computer science the same approach might

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,000
work in any subject so that's quite an

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,159
exciting possibility um

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,320
just one thing this is all about low

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,679
stakes formative assessment by this is

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,000
sort of technical terminate

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,520
in edu speak term summative assessment

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,279
means weighing the pig

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,039
at the end of the course did you pass

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,039
right are you you know

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,080
are you fat enough right have you have

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,159
you um uh

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,520
have you got to the bar that means you

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,159
have passed the course that summative

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,880
assessment

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,279
formative assessment is about um is more

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
like

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
going to the gym um than than going to

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
the olympics

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,760
it's how you get strong right so it's

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,159
you're going to

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,760
do questions uh in a sort of quiz quiz

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,520
kind of way perhaps every week

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,960
because then you'll learn about what

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,159
misconceptions you hold

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,600
what things you can do what things you

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,120
can't do you'll know what to study and

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
actually the act of doing questions can

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,640
itself be very

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,720
educative so formative assessment is

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,960
what all this about low stakes

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
right so then the last part of this

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,520
puzzle is um

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,840
we met up with a a um a a partner

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,840
um called edie who they're they're a um

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,600
they're actually a small british startup

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,760
who already had a very large question

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
the corpus of maths questions

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,640
um and they already had a platform to

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,840
distribute it on because it's no good

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,240
having a course of questions if you

00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
can't

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,279
put it in front of a lot of teachers a

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
lot of students they already had a

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,520
platform they already had a corpus of

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,679
questions

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,799
and um we could just add computing

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,880
questions to their platform so that

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,640
where they became our partner so this is

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,159
a sort of mixture of a research project

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,120
and a delivery project all mixed up

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
together

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,159
um so these questions are um

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,240
all multiple choice questions right so

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,520
how is bit prejudiced against multiple

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,399
choice questions right isn't that just

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
for babies

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,240
um actually it turns out that multiple

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
choice questions

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,000
have a very strong educational pedigree

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,720
and are extremely effective if used in

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,399
the right way

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,399
and if they're high quality questions

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,240
right so one thing is you want

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,080
the the wrong answers rather just be

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,000
random old wrong answers

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,760
each wrong answer ideally embodies a

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,640
misconception so in this example what's

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,000
the lowest

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,440
common multiple of 12 and three um

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
uh well um uh you know three

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,520
is a uh you know it's a divisor of 12

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,919
and three not a multiple so

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
the idea is that that hey and so is four

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,880
so um

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,000
they're not just random wrong answers

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,279
they're wrong answers that could have a

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,320
rationale for a student who sort of

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,600
somehow got themselves

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,640
backwards or upside down so um

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,880
um and questions like this you can use

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,200
in

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,039
all sorts of ways you can use them in

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,760
quizzes to check progress you can use a

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,520
use a single question in class um as a

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
weight as a pedagogy

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,039
you can administer quizzes three weeks

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,399
after you finish teaching that topic

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,120
this thing called space repetition that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,120
says if you

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,960
get a student to revisit a topic that

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,320
they have not studied for three weeks

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
it actually anchors the stuff in their

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,440
memory more it's all good so

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,120
multiple choice is fine um moment of

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,720
assessment makes sense thank you jess

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,159
um look probably going to go there are

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,760
quizzes with questions even the right

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,640
way to determine mastery

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
so martin just asked are quizzes with

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,600
questions the right way to determine

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
mastery of a computing topic

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,640
wouldn't demonstration be more effective

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
so i think that's an excellent question

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,840
if you want to say

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,760
how do you demonstrate mastery multiple

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,799
choice questions of this kind are only

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,159
one you know one weapon in the armory

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,840
you need lots of weapons in the army

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,840
education is jolly complicated

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,440
this is just one thing and it's

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,399
specifically not meant to be summative

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,880
right it's meant to be

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,640
one way in which you might learn well

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,240
right that's the goal

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,679
okay um now so but this all begs the

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,880
question is if we crowdsource the

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,000
questions how do we know if they're any

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
good i've been saying good

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,279
high quality multiple choice questions

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,880
good well one way of course is we could

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,480
use hand curation but that's all labor

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
intensive and even experts get this

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,600
stuff wrong

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,000
so here's the big idea could you use

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,200
data on hundreds of millions of answers

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,720
to tens of thousands of questions

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
given by millions of students could you

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,240
take all of that data and answer

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,880
questions like in the green boxes here

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
things like

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,799
is this a good question does it

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,200
discriminate between strong students

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,399
and weak students how hard is this

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,000
question

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,600
right given the questions the students

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,039
already answered what should be the next

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
question the student might try these are

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,120
all

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
things that you might hope to get if you

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,640
had enough data

00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,840
right and these days the enough data

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,240
thing is totally

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,159
um flavor of the month so in fact

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,919
there's two flavors of the month here so

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,279
one is we're tackling this data in two

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
different ways one is

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,480
rash analysis so this is very well

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
established not new flavor of the month

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,039
stuff

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,799
just standard educational practice it's

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,080
a statistical analysis of data on

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,240
question answers

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,960
and pretty much it says you can imagine

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,559
this if i told you

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,399
that this was a high quality question

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,519
and how hard all the high quality

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,440
questions were on some

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,640
some linear scale you could tell me how

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
strong every student was because you

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,840
could just say

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,519
which questions did they get right or

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,640
wrong but we don't know how hard every

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,799
question is

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,159
if we knew how strong every student was

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,159
we could determine

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,600
how hard all the questions were and

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,640
which were high quality ones because the

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,159
low quality ones

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
would not discriminate between strong

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,760
students and weak students and the high

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,960
quality ones would at some point on the

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,720
scale discriminate

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
right and also you could tell where they

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,840
were discriminated so you could tell how

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,080
difficult each question was

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,840
so if you knew one half of this puzzle

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,000
you could figure out the other half

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,679
but we know neither half so maybe we can

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,480
just solve a simultaneous statistical

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
equation

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,600
and get best fit and that's what rash

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,279
analysis is um

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,360
and so you can do this at scale um

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,559
yes is there a link so brian asked is

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
there a link to project quantum

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,840
yes at the end i'm going to give you a

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
link that a link that indirectly links

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,679
you to everything

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,960
um thanks bob but search for um uh yes

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,399
i'll give you a link at the end

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,919
okay uh so this is um that was magic

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
number one so that's gonna as it were

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,399
using established technology but not

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,399
applied

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,559
i believe rationality is usually applied

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,080
to thousands of answers to

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,000
a few questions in an exam this is going

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,679
to be a much bigger scale

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,480
but the second piece i just want to give

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,480
you a a sense about because it's

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,760
exciting to see computer science in the

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,640
service of education

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,360
um is to use machine learning so here's

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
the idea

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,960
you will know about the sort of the

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,080
original netflix challenge

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,440
in which um various individuals offer

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,120
their preferences of some

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,840
but not all movies films um so here's an

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,919
example

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,039
um they uh you know you say which ones

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,440
you like which ones you don't and of

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,039
course

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
most movies you haven't seen you express

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,519
no preference and the task is

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
based on this very sparse matrix fill in

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,559
all the blanks

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,240
and that's the way recommender system

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,279
works recommender systems

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,960
work and they have been pretty um pretty

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,559
effective in practice

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,840
now if you just this is my colleague

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,559
cheng who works on this kind of stuff

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,600
and who is running

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,880
the machine learning part of this

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,000
project if you um just change the titles

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,159
on the top of the top of the columns

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,919
from movies to questions and

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,640
put in the boxes the whether the student

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,880
got the question

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,080
right or wrong and the blanks are the

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,919
questions they haven't done

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,919
you can see it's really the same problem

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,360
right we could impute or guess

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,720
the the answers to all the questions

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,279
they haven't done based on the answers

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,519
that they

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,880
have done and of course what everybody

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,320
else has said

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,159
because the whole idea is to use the

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,919
answers from some students to inform

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
uh you know to learn patterns that we

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,399
might inform others so that would be an

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,240
amazing if we could do that

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,159
right but if we could fill in this

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,080
matrix based on you know

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
um uh sort of recommender type

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,279
technology um

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,559
we could then answer questions like how

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,720
difficult is this question

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
well how difficult is this question it's

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,079
kind of like you might say

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,200
a hard question most students will get

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,440
it wrong

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,119
right so a completely filled in column

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
most students will get it wrong

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,440
how strong is the student look at the

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,359
row how many questions of all in

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,240
the whole corpus do they get right sort

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,639
of reflection of how strong they are

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,359
and we might ask uh the quality of the

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,119
question

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,399
to what extent does knowing the answer

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,599
to a single question

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,240
a single question enable you to predict

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,359
um uh the uh the rest of the i should

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,560
have said the rest of the

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:47,040
column um or did i mean row here um

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,760
uh knowing the answer to a single

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,679
question maybe

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,200
maybe i mean column yes but predict the

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,200
other um

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,639
uh if you know if you know the answer to

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,480
a single question in a column

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,079
can you predict the other rows um on the

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,200
basis of that question so how much does

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
a question tell you

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,560
um about what the students will answer

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,839
to other questions so

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,000
it's a sort of route to this kind of

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,240
thing so how does this magic work

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,599
uh well um so i've learned all this i'm

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,400
not a machine learning person at all but

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,960
i've had to learn

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
and here's um here's what i've learned

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,839
so this is my this is a sort of quick

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,680
um a quick uh dive into um auto encoders

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,119
um and you'll be able to impress your

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
friends so if you're not already a

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,680
machine learning person if you are then

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,720
you can quote my mistakes

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,280
so um the idea is that

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,400
we're going to take information about a

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,400
particular student

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
let's say student s so that could be

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,079
their age their school their eye color

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,760
their address any any metadata you have

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,200
probably sparse you won't have much data

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,320
about you have some data about some

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,119
students and not everything about

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
everybody

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,640
but you'll also have all of the answers

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
that they have given so far

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,839
you take all of that and you smush it

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,920
into this neural network

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,599
the encoder just is in your network and

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,160
it will spit out

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
a vector of n floating point numbers and

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,040
the idea is those floating point numbers

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,800
are called the student embedding that's

00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,520
going to somehow characterize what we

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,000
know about s

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,640
the student with the idea that similar

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,720
students

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,920
will somehow encode to similar

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,800
embeddings

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,880
nearby embeddings in this n-dimensional

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,920
student embedding space

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
then the decoder thing um takes a uh

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
you know the the embedding the student

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,839
embedding and a particular question id

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,359
and spits out the predicted answer from

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,359
that student to that question

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,960
okay so it's called an auto encoder

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,800
because the output

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,320
if you the output is the same as the

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
input we're trying to make the thing

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,640
predict

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,160
um its own inputs uh but

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,760
under the artificial restriction that

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,680
we've sort of squeezed down

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,960
the the bottleneck in the middle to this

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,400
student embedding because we're we're

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,000
trying to make it generalize

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,359
we're trying to force it to say well

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,400
similar students go to similar

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,720
embeddings and then

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,680
then if we get um as we get a new

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,599
student

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,880
we can uh determine their embedding

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,320
based on what we know about them

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,880
and then we can predict their answers to

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,880
all questions

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,800
so um in this um in this picture now do

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,440
you remember with rash analysis

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,560
uh over here students were kind of one

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,839
dimensional and questions were

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,079
one-dimensional they were just on a

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,079
linear scale from nought to 200.

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,280
now our students are n-dimensional so

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,640
it's much more likely

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,640
to somehow accurately characterize

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
the you know the characteristics of a

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,760
student in some mysterious machine

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
learning way

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,720
so then that's auto encoders now what

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
we're actually going to use is a

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,200
variational auto encoder

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,920
so there instead of n numbers we're

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,960
going to have

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,680
n gaussians or more precisely

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,000
n mean standard deviation pairs because

00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,040
a mean

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,720
and a standard deviation will

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,359
characterize a gaussian so you can think

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
of that as

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,640
instead of n numbers we can have n

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,520
probability distributions of the numbers

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,839
so we can say

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,800
for each student how confident we are

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,119
about their

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,240
um about where they live on that

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,839
particular

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,839
dimension of the n-dimensional space

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,760
so this sort of starts to let us encode

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,520
uncertainty and then and then the

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
decoder is going to spit about spit out

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,160
not the answer that they

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,079
whether they get it right or wrong but

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,599
the probability that they get it right

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,200
or wrong or in a multiple choice thing

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,480
the probability that they answer a the

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,480
probability of the answer b

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
bobble the answer c and so forth now you

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,880
can see if it's just yes no

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,359
you can see that if this thing spits out

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,599
zero

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,440
or one you know it's definitely going to

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,920
say no definitely going to say yes

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,680
then the network has at least believes

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
it has high confidence

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,160
about knowing the answer if it says with

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,040
probability 0.5 the students will get

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,560
the answer correct

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,160
that's an indication of low confidence

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,920
so that's helpful because it means that

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,520
this thing is going to tell us it gave

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,079
us some indication about how confident

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,599
it is

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,960
in the results now you know the machine

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,280
learning is complicated and that even

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
when

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,240
neural networks say they're confident

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,680
that's not necessarily right right they

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,119
might have had skewed data all sorts of

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,000
things might have gone wrong this is not

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,440
a magic bullet

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,640
but uh variational autoencoders um uh

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
quite well you know quite well

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,920
established in all sorts of applications

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,599
and they seem to work quite well in this

00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,040
so we tried it here's a here's

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,440
here's our first experiments we did last

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,560
summer which we built that built this

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,160
system and used it to

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,040
fill in that whole matrix and then we

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,400
took 40 pairs of questions and we asked

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,320
the human expert

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,480
to say of these pairs which one was

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,079
higher quality

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,079
and on 80 of those 40 we agreed

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,599
well you know our system agreed with the

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,960
um the ordering that craig

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,119
craig said so this is a really small

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,560
sample you can't draw any conclusion

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,280
from this but it was sort of encouraging

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,240
it suggested

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,680
that we weren't completely up the spout

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
the other thing we try to that was to do

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,839
with

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
quality of questions remember that was

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,359
one axis we were interested in

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,800
another axis we're interested in is how

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,000
hard this question is

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,280
so it's quite difficult to design

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,839
experiments around this but here's what

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,320
we did

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,200
we took 13 collections of questions that

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,040
we already had

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,760
this is advantage of working with edie

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,680
right they already had these collections

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,880
and we asked craig to put these

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,119
collections

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,880
in a in a list ordered by difficulty now

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,680
the questions the collections themselves

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,760
were typically

00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,359
you know a year's program of study for a

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,960
child so he had a pretty good idea of

00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,280
which one was harder than which

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,720
and we then not you know not having that

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,000
knowledge just use machine learning to

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,160
try to predict an ordering

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,599
based on this um the the way of

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,319
discovering difficulty that i described

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,079
earlier

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,680
and and it turned out that our

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,599
prediction turned out to be much better

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,839
correlated with the human experts

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,200
um ordering than a number of other

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,760
competing approaches there is a paper

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,839
about this

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,640
um as yet sadly unpublished but it's

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,119
unarchived

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,640
um so i would say we've taken sort of

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,400
baby steps in this direction we've got

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,520
sort of more more going uh what i really

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,319
like about this project

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,160
is that it's a real symbiosis between

00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,240
machine learning research really because

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,680
that's a complicated big space you know

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,920
real hot area

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,800
lots of people at microsoft research um

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,800
are doing uh

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,560
um doing research and machine learning

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,000
at the moment um but it's also very

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
closely connected with delivery we want

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,800
this thing to

00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,480
be actually useful in practice for

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,480
school teachers today

00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,240
so i'm really excited about this because

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,280
i love the idea of computer science in

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,240
service of

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,240
computing education

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,839
okay um let's see last bit just to

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
finish

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,160
um uh how can we help how can we help

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,880
zoom out again

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,720
we as a now we i'm talking broadly about

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,440
us as uh computing professionals

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,119
right so um i think we ought to want to

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
help because this is our subject right

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,560
we actually know this subject this is

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
this is what we're keeping about

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,280
um for teachers i think it's a time of

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
inspiration and opportunity and also a

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,280
time of anxiety and fear and stress

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,640
right because it is hard you feel

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,000
exposed um

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
when you are asked to teach something

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,359
you really don't know very much about in

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,319
the same kind of depth as you're used to

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,319
so there's really really is a huge

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,359
opportunity for us and i think we can

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,280
hope that somebody else will do

00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
something but i would rather that we did

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,960
something

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,560
ourselves um and there's quite a lot

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
going on in that in the uk i guess

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,160
a lot of you are based not in the uk but

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,920
i think still we should all

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,839
individually and corporately roll up our

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,240
sleeves and i think this is a

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,000
seminar within github within microsoft

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,880
um and i think there's quite a lot that

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
we can do

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,000
we can do more together than we can

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,520
individually yes we can all help

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
individually but i think if we

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,400
operate as groups um you know that with

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,079
as work groups within our company

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,240
um we'll be more effective because we

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,920
can be as partners for schools

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
we can be more reliable than a single

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,240
individual can be a single individual

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,839
can be

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,119
keen and have time in one year but not

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,520
the next year that's not good for a

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,800
school

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,640
so we can sustain over time and

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,000
it turns out the companies and microsoft

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,760
github i'm sure and

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,960
and in fact i know and and other

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,400
companies more broadly they're actually

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,000
quite keen on this they're quite

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,000
um quite supportive if you say this is

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,560
what i'd like to do um but it doesn't

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,920
happen

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,800
it doesn't happen unless we do something

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,560
we ourselves we as individuals

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,160
have to lead right we can't just wait

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
for somebody else to do it so i'd like

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,560
to encourage you to start a group in

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,880
your little bit of

00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,000
github or microsoft um or anywhere else

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,119
encourage each other

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,720
um and um uh to sort of get those

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,680
enthusiasms i think of you know people

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,240
together

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,319
instead of like in separate pieces your

00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,880
little gobs of enthusiasm the enthusiasm

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,480
sort of

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
you know go off into the ether and they

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,440
get lost when you're together

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,200
they sort of hit off each other and you

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,000
get more you get an exothermic reaction

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,520
going

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,119
um and once you've got that then you can

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,960
start to form relationships with schools

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,400
you have to pick some actual schools

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,319
um and talk to them because you need to

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
be grounded in reality um

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,160
and that's um and to do that you need to

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,040
be uh you know somewhat proactive

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,520
and um and and be sort of humble as well

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,440
um

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,800
right because education is complicated

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,119
and school teachers do know a lot about

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,280
it

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,480
so we need is no good parachuting in and

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,160
say we know all the answers

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,680
we've got to really work in a sort of

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,280
respectful and

00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,760
quite humble partnership with our school

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,119
teachers saying how genuinely

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,560
can i help what do you need and

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,480
the only the only difficulty is they

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,760
probably won't know so you have to sort

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,200
of be persistent enough to say how can

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,880
we work together to figure out what you

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,440
need

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,560
okay the important thing is don't just

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,839
sit there

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,839
do something do something

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,160
let me just finish here right so is it

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,280
back with our children

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,079
i really want them to i want this this

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,200
is not about

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,400
some sort of political success this is

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,240
about

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,839
enabling our children to be you know

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,359
empowered informed engaged

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:19,040
curious playful and yes employed

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,480
um young people uh and enthusiastic

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,880
about the subject that we all

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,560
hold dear here's a link that i promised

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,920
you the top one despite funny

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,440
url is a page of links that i curate

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
so it will have it has pointers to

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,119
project quantum to the programme of

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,040
study

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,400
to the royal society reports and lots

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,440
more besides um

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,599
the national center for community

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,800
education is that second link um so do

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,160
take a look at these things links for

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
more information and of course i'd be

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,760
full to

00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,880
talk to any of you individually um about

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,760
this but now we should stop

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
and uh um address questions so ugly i'm

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,160
gonna go back to you

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,160
and let you be in control of that

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,800
hello hello

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,010
yeah there he is uh thanks very much uh

00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,160
thanks very much simon

00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,200
[Music]

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:13,119
wonderfully wonderfully inspiring uh uh

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,960
thank you um a few questions uh already

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:20,319
came in are you addressed most of them

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,480
first are uh exactly so perhaps uh so

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,520
this is the question about

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,000
uh uh at what at what

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,200
age you would teach different sorts of

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,720
abstractions so

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,319
for example polymorphism

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,800
or object orientation uh

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,319
at what age you bring in our what

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,240
concepts

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,920
so this is a great question because it's

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,760
about pedagogy it's about what

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,160
about and concepts and conceptual

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,200
structures right so um

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,040
i think um

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,160
so i think the true answer is nobody

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,319
really knows because we don't have

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,520
enough experience yet but i believe that

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,160
um we can that the children are perhaps

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,440
more capable

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,720
than we we take them for i don't think i

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,839
too want to teach polymorphism in

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,200
primary school

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,319
um but i think the um the programme of

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,680
study i referred to

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,800
for the this two-page document um does

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,240
certainly by the time you're at

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,480
secondary school aged 11 to 14

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,920
um it specifically calls out in the

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,760
control structures um

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:27,040
uh loops and selection and uh sequencing

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,119
and alternation uh

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,480
polymorphism i think later but then you

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,520
need to sort of get into a type system

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,040
object-oriented

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,480
object orientation well there's a

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,599
there's a whole interesting thing some

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,319
people would like to teach

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,680
um a lot starting with objects and first

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,880
principles um

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,640
i don't know but i think there's room

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,800
for experimentation there there's quite

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,480
a lot of educational research about

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,640
um how to teach computer science at

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,200
university level not very much at school

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,960
level

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,880
and there's a crying need i think it the

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,240
way i think of it is we've got

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,520
um you know we're spending a billion

00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,119
pounds a year on school teachers to

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,400
teach computing now because they're all

00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,599
teaching this curriculum

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,839
i mean if you add them all up it's a lot

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,160
of money we ought to be spending

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,880
you know a million or 10 million a year

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,839
on

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,720
researchers to help them to be even 20

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,319
more effective

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,240
you know would be a fantastically good

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,920
investment for

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,520
10 million pounds so um

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,520
i don't have a conclusive answer to your

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,280
question um but i think it's the right

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,720
kind of question to ask and i think

00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,920
that the you know education teachers and

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,200
educational researchers

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,000
do have a much sort of better

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,040
characterized answer and it's being

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,880
but i think about elementary programming

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,240
i'm pretty sure that we can do a lot

00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,200
even at primary school but lots of

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,319
primary schools are doing scratch

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
programming and they're doing

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,520
you know definitely writing loops you

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,480
know loops and control

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,960
they're doing all this at primary school

00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,359
definitely today i know now it's not to

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,720
say

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,040
perfect progression i don't know the

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,640
perfect progression but

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,079
don't underestimate children is that's

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
what i'm saying okay that was a long

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,079
answer to a short question

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,119
a new question came in from brian

00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,760
cardiff

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,280
when predicting a wrong answer if the

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,160
student is suggested to make

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,720
a to make first a learning task that

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,640
would likely change the prediction

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:14,079
learning tasks take learning tasks taken

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,960
as part of student metadata

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,839
is something i are you i'm not totally

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,240
sure i understand the question i'm

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:22,640
afraid

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,640
um

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,440
brian can't talk can he so um

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,559
so i think maybe brian's getting at

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,839
something about his

00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,640
um brian cardiff about um adaptive

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,640
learning so

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,559
uh if a student gets a question wrong

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,240
and obvious um you know this question is

00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,720
in an interactive system you might hope

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,079
that

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,280
uh the system might then offer some

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,280
um you know some guidance about you know

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,200
what's wrong and then offer another

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,400
question maybe a little easier one that

00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
would take you on a journey that would

00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,480
get you

00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:01,520
um understanding the topic better

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,240
and so uh indeed a very a very

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,400
reasonable

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,920
question to ask of a machine learning

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,079
kind of system is what question

00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,079
would maximize your information gain

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,400
about students knowledge in this topic

00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,160
um so a question about if they get it

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,559
wrong what learning should you you know

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,839
what

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,480
material should you offer them to help

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:21,599
them learn better that is um

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,520
uh that's hard that's a

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,720
broader one than we're addressing i

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,359
think right so

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,559
lots of ed tech platforms are addressing

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,119
that kind of thing they would like to

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,440
say

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,880
our wonderful ai driven platform we'll

00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,480
take you on a learning journey we'll

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,400
offer you all sorts of good information

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,680
and indeed edie is building such a thing

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,760
um but it's that's that's

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,000
a lot more ambitious than the in some

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,640
ways the project that i described this

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,400
quantum project has quite a narrow focus

00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,160
it's not solving the whole problem by

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,680
any means but it's a sufficiently

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,359
constrained one that i think we might

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,200
actually be able to make some progress

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,800
if you try to bowl the ocean i worry

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,599
that you won't succeed so

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,880
i think no edtech edtech platforms are

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,359
trying to boil the ocean because that's

00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
in the end

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,200
in the end the ocean wants to be boiled

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,200
but but this research project is more

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,920
downrightly focused

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,319
very intense but i wanted so so far

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,359
we've

00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:16,640
so far we've talked about uh or

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,800
computing as its own separate subject so

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,839
what about weaving computational

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,960
thinking into

00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,880
other subjects uh more computation and

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,920
physics and maths and

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:32,559
yeah we don't even need it separately

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,319
so so this is an important question

00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,400
right because it's um

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,800
there's a so let me first point out one

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,160
danger when we first write back in 2008

00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,359
um people said to us but you don't

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,720
really need computer

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,480
subjects at all we should just teach it

00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,800
as part of other subjects shouldn't we

00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,079
right it's so you know ict or computing

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,280
across the curriculum

00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,640
um and there's something in that because

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,480
of course

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,960
computational thinking and informational

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,200
thinking can and should infuse

00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,960
you know physics and maths and indeed

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,119
perhaps history and geography too

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,640
right thinking in a data science kind of

00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,720
way about geography

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,200
really changes the lens a lot but

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,880
think about maths if we said let's not

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,240
have math as a separate subject because

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,680
we can just learn it when we know when

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,200
we need to solve simultaneous equations

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,880
in a physical physics lesson we'll learn

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,520
to do that right

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,400
it would never happen because the

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,559
physics teacher

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,839
is interested in you know how to figure

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,800
out whether the magnet is doing the

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,160
right thing they're not really

00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,880
interested in simultaneous equations

00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,520
that's a means to an

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,480
end right so you you it would never

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,240
happen

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,680
you needed a sort of discrete subject to

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,480
pay attention to the principles

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,720
of that subject and then you know infuse

00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,720
it

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,319
in all of the other so i'm very sure

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,480
that we want to have

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,760
computing as a you know and computer

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,960
science in particular as a discrete

00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,359
subject

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,920
but not in a discrete silo any more than

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,400
maths in a discrete silo

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,559
so computing and maths are particularly

00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,599
symbiotic i think of computing or

00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,000
computer science

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:06,960
as mathematics made incarnate

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,400
that is mathematics takes flesh right if

00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,480
you think about induction

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,599
right some abstract mathematical idea i

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,640
think a for loop

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,559
is like executable induction right

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,000
in order to reasonable you do

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,400
mathematical induction but

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,119
a for loop executes the induction that's

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,440
so

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,400
i think of of computing as the practical

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,800
work of

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,720
maths really and i would love to see

00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,720
maths and computer science taught as a

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,680
sort of single integrated subject now

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,680
bootstrap which um uh leon mentioned is

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,240
a great program based in the usa out of

00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,720
brown and

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,559
shuram and his colleagues um but i think

00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,319
it's i think it's it sort of teaches

00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,760
i think it's sort of selling things it's

00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,599
mainly teaching maths but through the

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,720
medium of computing i'd love to see even

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,880
more integration and say

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,319
we're teaching maths and computing both

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,800
as foundational subjects

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,079
in a sort of symbiotic way but it's

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,880
quite a challenge because nobody knows

00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,359
how to do that

00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
and because it would take a teacher who

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,000
had some

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,240
sort of visceral you know in their heart

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
understanding about both mathematics and

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,920
computer science

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,359
and there would be like hens teeth so i

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,040
see that as being

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,480
ambitious goal for the future rather

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,160
than rather than something we should do

00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,960
now in fact i think if we try to do that

00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,839
too early

00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,800
i think we might screw it screw up and

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,800
end up with

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,079
maths with the little genuflection to

00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,839
computing um

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,720
or computer science and that would be

00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,240
you know that would lose the whole

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,599
essence

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,079
totally uh just martin has another

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,720
question

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,319
i'll read it out i work at an online

00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,839
coding school lamba school

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,000
and we are experiencing the same

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,319
struggle with writing our own valid

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,440
formative assessments it is a really

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,520
hard problem

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
i do think open source an open source

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,079
version of quizzing

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,400
related to different languages and

00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,119
technologies could be incredibly useful

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,119
even for learners later in life our

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,440
average student age is 32.

00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,640
what's the progress on open sorting that

00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,160
question set good question i really

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,400
think so i want to open source no i

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,960
don't need a question set but i want to

00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,720
uh i want to some what i would really

00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,920
like to do is to find a way to share the

00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,160
answers as well

00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,400
because what what i don't want is to

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,079
take a corpus of ten thousand questions

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,079
and fork it off somewhere else and then

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,440
the somewhere else gets lots of answers

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,359
but we don't get that data back

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,800
right because it's the data from all the

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,400
people answering those questions we want

00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,000
to have in one place so we can do all

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,440
this learning out of it so

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,640
at the moment to answer yes directly

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,839
jess i hope that you will email me

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,559
afterwards about this because i'd love

00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,280
to talk to you

00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,000
um at the moment the um the questions

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,599
are you know

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,119
they're all under um creative commons

00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,520
license um

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,640
but they're available um currently in

00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,559
the form of

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,160
completely free access through this ed

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,040
platform right so or the diagnostic

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,760
question platform

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,200
um so and you can get to that you know

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,160
in an embedded way as well as

00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,640
a web service um we haven't yet got as

00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,079
far as

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,599
let's take all of the questions shrink

00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,079
that in the box and just toss them over

00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,440
the fence

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,200
to somebody else right because that

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,760
would lose our connection with the data

00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,200
but quite how to make the whole thing

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,720
fly at scale in a way that's suitable

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,920
for everybody else's platform we haven't

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,880
grappled with enough yet and love to

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,599
talk to you about that

00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,559
but that that's my aspiration right an

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,160
open source question

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,480
uh open source questions with all the

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,599
data around it uh i mean some

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,960
uh would be that's that's the goal how

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,720
do we how do we achieve that but it

00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,680
could be incredibly valuable

00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,000
one repository of 10 000 questions with

00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,480
you know

00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,359
a billion answers is so much more

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,359
valuable

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,359
than 20 repositories of a thousand

00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:30,720
questions with you know very few answers

00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,720
much much yeah yes

00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:40,240
okay uh oh wow uh questions just keep uh

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,720
keep coming in uh want to pick one or

00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,599
yeah oh sorry sorry uh let's let's take

00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,119
the one from

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,640
uh uh alex taylor uh so

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,640
he's saying that a lot of the

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,079
mathematical ideas that you need in

00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,559
computer science

00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,480
uh are actually only taught at the

00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,559
really advanced star stage

00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,480
so logic processing you mentioned

00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,880
induction yourself actually induction

00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,400
yeah probably i encountered induction in

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:09,040
university not in uh

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,040
uh not in the northeast school so

00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,559
uh uh we really would also have to

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,480
change maths

00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:19,680
and to to teach the right uh concepts

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,960
early enough yeah that's an interesting

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,240
thought

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,960
i don't really thought very much about

00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,280
that yes so the moment because

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,440
i feel as if maths is like you know the

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,200
big elephant in the room it's it's got

00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,839
you know centuries of um

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,119
of uh uh knowledge and baggage and

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:36,480
thought about how to do it

00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,160
and uh you know they're not going to

00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,680
look kindly on us us up starts telling

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,520
them how to do it

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,799
but over time i think as we gain

00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,200
credibility i think they will

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,839
um pay attention indeed um indeed

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,440
already are

00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,319
so one one interesting look at maths

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,440
education

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:55,119
that um uh alex might want to to look at

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,640
is called the maths fix it's a book

00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,799
called the maths fix that

00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,760
uh conrad wolfham has just put out um

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,359
conrad is

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,760
um conrad and stephen wolfe were

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,760
involved in well the founded wolf from

00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,520
um the company uh that do mathematica

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,040
and so forth um but conrad has been

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,680
deeply involved in maths education and

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,280
he has

00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,280
this book that says and his thesis

00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,280
really is we should not be teaching

00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,880
children long division

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,119
right that's just teaching them to

00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,079
execute an algorithm we have computers

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,599
for that

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:25,440
yes so um so and so his point is we

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,440
should not teach maths as if computers

00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,040
did not exist

00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,480
we should teach maths as if computers

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,200
did exist and do exist

00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,160
and that might reframe how we teach

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,760
mathematics

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,359
now he's thinking of it primarily

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,559
primarily from the through the lens of

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,359
we still want to teach math but we want

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,680
to teach maths

00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,960
in a world in which mathematica for

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,400
example exists

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,559
i would also want to say we want to

00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,240
teach maths and computer and symbiosis

00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,520
with each other and that might indeed

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,079
influence about which bits of mass we

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,920
teach first

00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,520
as alex suggests and really thought of

00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,040
that very much but it must

00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,400
um so it's entirely plausible

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,119
okay uh we are up against uh our time

00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,839
uh uh thanks everyone uh for attending

00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,680
thanks for the

00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:11,280
uh great questions hopefully we can

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:14,559
uh continue online uh i'll just close by

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,119
paraphrasing the last comment posted by

00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,880
brian abbott uh computer science is

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:22,079
mathematics incarnate

00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,599
i love simon thank you for uh he said

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,040
thank you for the gift that you gave to

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,040
all of us in high school

00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,440
uh simon thanks so much for uh yet

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:34,000
another wonderfully inspiring talk

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,000
great pleasure thank you thank you bye

00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
cheers
