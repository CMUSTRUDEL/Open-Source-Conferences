Description: 
	What Would Open Source Look Like If It Were Healthy?

When I think about open source sustainability, I think about money, sure. But I also think about what configurations of funding would be more likely to keep legacy infrastructure ticking along AND provide R&D opportunities for innovators; what tooling we need; how a stronger ecology of consultancies would change the interactions among volunteers, companies, and other institutions; etc. I'll discuss what I've learned about healthy maintainership, and what a healthier future would look like for the open source industry.

Sumana Harihareswara is a project manager and programmer who has worked on PyPI, Zulip, Mailman, MediaWiki, HTTPS Everywhere, and several other open source projects. Most recently she has managed improvements to pip's dependency resolver and user experience, expedited the release of new versions of pipenv and autoconf, and written a somewhat frightening number of successful grant proposals to fund urgent work in critical open source projects. She earned an Open Source Citizen Award in 2011 and a Google Open Source Peer Bonus in 2018. She lives in New York City and founded Changeset Consulting in 2015.

[Music]

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
hi everyone

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,320
welcome to the octo speaker series my

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,840
name is edan

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,840
and i run the developer experiences

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,720
research team in github's office of the

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,800
cto

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,039
we hold the speaker series meetups once

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
or twice a month and every episode tries

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,320
to dig

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,880
into the future of software with the

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
speaker

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,480
that can shed some light on where we're

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,399
going and

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,000
what's going on today to help decipher

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,879
that future

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
octo's charter is to look at the future

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,879
of developer experiences

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
and it's easy in this role to think in

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,000
terms of what can be built

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,079
or things that can be used when my team

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,879
sits down to talk about what to pursue

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
next

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,320
that's the easiest place to start

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,760
brainstorming like wouldn't it be

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,079
cool if there was a thing that did x

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,760
but the second question that we ask is

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
is always a human one

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,760
what's the behavior that we want to

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,600
affect what's the human impact

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,880
if we make things that aren't changing

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
behaviors

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,920
then there's nothing durable about

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
whatever we're doing and that's a smell

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,080
that we're barking up

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
the wrong trees it's the second question

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
that i think about a lot

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
because it helps us keep our sights on

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,400
the horizon and stay out of the tooling

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
trap

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
tools come and go but humans are always

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,079
going to be a part of software projects

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
it's also relatively easy to think about

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,079
how tools shape behavior

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,840
tools hopefully have some kind of

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,000
affordance that tell you

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
how they're meant to be used they guide

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
you into the right motions and behaviors

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
if i think about

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
a hammer that affordance is obvious i

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,399
have a handle

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
it's about the right size for a hand it

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
feels better if i hold it the right way

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
then if i hold it anywhere else the

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,600
hammer teaches me how to use it the real

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
question is

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
what's the equivalent for things that

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,079
are not tools if i think about

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
communities as shaping human behavior

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,799
then what's the equivalent concept there

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,360
i can't look at a community and say ah

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,360
that's where i can hold on to a handle

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
it's not that communities can't define

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
affordances or

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
guide people into the right motions it's

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
that it's less

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,239
obvious how to do that even if you do

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,080
figure it out in one community

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,440
it's difficult to transfer that kind of

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,440
success from one community to another

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,280
this is a topic that's squarely in

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
octo's domain of interest already but i

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
think it's

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
particularly topical to my team right

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
now because of where we work

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
like it or not an overwhelming number of

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
software communities exist

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
through github if we can find ways to

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
make community success a tiny bit easier

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,720
then we could be a rising tide too many

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,680
boats and nobody flat out has the

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
answers to this

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
but we're all developing on top of a

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,720
mountain of other people's code

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
and if we want that mountain to be

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,760
stable for each of us to be able to

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360
reach a little further

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
then we have to wrestle with these

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
sticky uncomfortable questions about

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,720
communities

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
and how to make them work we can't keep

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,599
building

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,080
better parsers and web frameworks and

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,720
whatever and expect them to paper over

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
what are

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
fundamentally questions about how humans

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
interact

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,879
as the world of software onboards more

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
practitioners making communities succeed

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,080
is a really urgent question

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,440
and i also think that there's room for

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
some pointed looks

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
at what the forges of software like

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,680
github can do to make these communities

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,640
flourish how can we encourage

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,319
healthy growth of not just contributors

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
but maintainers the people who have an

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,640
interest in the project beyond the code

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
what even constitutes a community what

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
constitutes

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
success and how do we transfer

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
successful patterns from one community

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
to another

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,640
so today i'm delighted to welcome semana

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,280
hari hareshwara to the octo speaker

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
series

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,640
she's the founder of changeset

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
consulting and has been active in a

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,799
variety of open source communities for

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,640
years

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,319
her work on the python packaging

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
ecosystem is particularly relevant

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
because

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,799
many software communities are defined by

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,200
the packaging infrastructure

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
that makes that community possible if

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
you've ever built software from source

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,879
on a posix-like system

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,319
using the configure make make install

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
dance then you've benefited from our

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,959
efforts

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,720
the autoconf project was stuck without

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
releases for eight years until she got

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,799
involved

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
and she's writing a book on the matter

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,120
called getting unstuck

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,160
advice for open source projects she has

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
a wealth of both

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
personal and professional experience to

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,840
bring to bear on that second question

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
how do we make communities successful

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
as with every episode of the speaker

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,840
series i want to remind everybody

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
that we have a code of conduct published

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,199
on our discussion repo

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
and we care about it sticking to a code

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
of conduct while discussing javascript

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,919
is relatively

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
easy but here we're going to be talking

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,240
about communities and behaviors and

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,280
people and humans so more so than

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
previous episodes

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,560
please be thoughtful please be kind and

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
please listen to the moderators

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
we want a good talk and we want hard

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
questions and we want

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
everyone to feel great participating in

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
the discussion even when we're

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,479
discussing these hard things

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,440
i've also started a github discussions

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,560
thread to collect questions at the link

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,280
below and we'll also be looking at

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
twitch chat

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
we'll come back to these after

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,560
summoner's talk seminars talk

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,639
and i'll bring these questions up in

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,080
discussion so please don't be shy

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
without further ado welcome semina

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
hey there adam thank you very much for

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,320
having me um

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,960
and i hope at some point that i can also

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,840
come back and give a purely comedic

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,880
performance

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,080
where i uh make jokes about for instance

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,000
uh other licenses that we could

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,360
possibly bring into the system like the

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
wedding gift license

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,880
where you can use it for free for a year

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
but would it kill you to send a thank

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
you note

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,919
i also do some amount of stand up but i

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,120
will not have nearly as many jokes today

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,000
as i wish i hope that's okay with you

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
adan

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
that's totally fine uh thank you so much

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,199
for for coming on we're really excited

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
to have you here

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
uh take it away thank you so much

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,280
thank you and i'd also like to thank and

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,600
acknowledge

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,759
uh since i live in new york city uh the

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,319
matinee and mast path people

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,600
on whose ancestral land i stand the

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
african people

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,759
whose bones were buried unmarked in the

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,199
city's foundations and the involuntary

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
and exploited labor

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
of people from every land which helped

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,520
to make new york city great

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,639
i'm here today to talk about open source

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960
as an industry

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
and what it would look like if it were

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,000
healthy

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,560
except i can only talk about healthier

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
not healthy uh and i am going to share

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
some stories

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
some composite visions of what healthier

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,960
open source would look like

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,599
i am going to do that but first i'm

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,479
gonna take five or six minutes to ask

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
well what would healthy include what

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,360
would it look like if

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,800
open source were healthy well literally

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,759
the people would be healthier right we

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
would have

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,599
health care for everybody i live in the

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
united states where we do not have

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,800
universal health care

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,599
universal health care in the united

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,319
states and in a bunch of other countries

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,039
would make open source healthier not

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,880
just because

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,720
it would mean that friends of mine would

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
have an easier time getting to see the

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
doctors but also

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,400
at least in the united states the need

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
for reliable health care and health

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
insurance

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,440
causes a tremendous number of open

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
source contributors

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,120
to have to take full-time jobs

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
with employers where they're working

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
either zero percent or a very small

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,440
percent of the time on open source and

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
they're working most of the time

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
on proprietary software and then they

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,039
have to do their open source just sort

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,919
of in nights and weekends and things

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
like that

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,039
and if you look at for instance uh

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
phreaxian which is an effort

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
where debian developers club together

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
and get sponsorship money so they can

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,879
each spend

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,800
a certain number of hours each month

00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,680
consulting on really important parts of

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
debian

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,120
software and infrastructure you know a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
lot of those people who can take

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
advantage of that

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,800
are in europe are in places where they

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
can do consulting they can switch back

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,319
and forth between full-time employment

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,360
and consulting a lot more easily

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
because health care isn't a question if

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,440
we had

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
universal health care we would more

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
easily be able to recruit programmers to

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,120
work on

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,759
under produced under-supported

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,840
infrastructural work

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,840
like debian we'd be able to crowdfund

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,639
people and we'd be able to free people

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,919
as well

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,399
to crowdfund short periods of work doing

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
innovative research that might not lead

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
to near-term

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,279
products and startups and and things

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,240
like that

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,360
another thing that would have healthier

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
open source

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,240
is one of its outcomes would be high

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,440
quality universal early childhood

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,240
child care so that parents could more

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
easily concentrate on their work if they

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
are

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,080
consulting and if they are working

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
outside the home

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,680
and uh if there were centers that

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
provided regular day care for working

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,800
parents and also had extra capacity

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,399
for drop-ins and overnights then in case

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,120
up there's some deadlines some fire

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
breaks out

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
you know that parent could participate

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,720
and could make sure that they had the

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
time

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
to make the right decision instead of

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
the quick decision because somebody else

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,560
was helping take care

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,000
of the kids another thing that would

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
make open source healthier

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
would be a hell of a lot more direct

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,279
funding

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
for open source infrastructure and for

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
research and development

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,080
from the non-profit sector and from rich

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,760
universities and i'm going to

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,640
get into the weeds just a little bit

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,080
right now on basically tax policy but

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,880
it's actually important

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,560
right now there are lots of rich

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
universities and nonprofit foundations

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,760
who have

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
trillions of dollars of assets in the

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
united states alone

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
and some of those do spend a little bit

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
of money

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,440
funding sometimes through grants open

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
source

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
software open source projects open

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
source infrastructure it would make a

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,680
huge difference

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,079
if non-profit foundations enrich

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,120
universities and donor-advised funds

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,519
which is a new

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,560
kind of construct that exists actually

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
paid out

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,399
more of their assets those trillions of

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
dollars that they have

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
to fund open source software work and

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,320
right now if you look up the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,680
five percent payout rule basically most

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
of these foundations at least the united

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,760
states

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
only have to make charitable

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
expenditures that equal or exceed

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,360
five percent of their endowment each

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
year and as these endowments go up and

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
up

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
often by more than five percent per year

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,160
that means they're accumulating money

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,600
instead of spending it out

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,200
uh the nonprofit af blog uh suggested

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
there's gonna be some links in the notes

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
that i hope adot is putting into

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
uh the twitch chat right now donor

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,040
advised funds have grown even more

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,600
rapidly

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,800
in number and assets and dafs have no

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
legal mandate

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,160
to pay out anything each year so donors

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,000
take

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
tax breaks immediately when they

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,760
transfer their wealth to dafs

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,200
but they're not legal those dafs are not

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
actually legally required to actually

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
distribute

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,360
those funds to nonprofits so there's a

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,079
lot of very wealthy

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,760
people who use dafs and private

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,440
foundations for tax advantages

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
and there are as i said some grant

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,839
programs that fund work in open source

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
from

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
some of these but it's very competitive

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,839
and it doesn't have to be the money

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,720
ought to be there so closing that

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,360
loophole

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
also funding the irs to actually enforce

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,680
its rules

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
would also free up money for government

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,200
investment and infrastructure

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,120
including healthcare climate resilience

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,839
education and open source all of which

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,040
would make

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,480
open source healthier uh the irs

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,839
enforcement thing i can get into that at

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,560
a later time

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,920
and also and you probably knew once you

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
started hearing me talk that i was going

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,440
to get to this a universal basic income

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
or a minimum income

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
would free so many people to work on

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,200
what they

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,399
want to work on and then if institutions

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,040
including companies

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
wanted to pay people extra to make an

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,079
enterprise thing happen then they could

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,000
and you know as long as i'm being a real

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,079
visionary and asking for things that

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,519
feel impossible

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,360
open source being healthy

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,560
a healthy world would be one in which i

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,279
could retcon

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,959
right back port some of the inclusion

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,560
and support that we ought to offer

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,079
everyone into the past the not so recent

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,120
and sometimes the recent past so that we

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
aren't missing

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
as many people in open source and in

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,920
this industry who ought to be working

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
with us

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
right now so this would be a universe in

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,360
which 14 years ago harassers didn't

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
force user experience expert kathy

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,720
sierra

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,839
to end her entire career in technology

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
and she's only briefly

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,200
returned this would be a universe in

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,680
which seven years ago a

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
now departed co-founder of github didn't

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
actually inappropriately to the first

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,200
female developer designer julianne

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
horvath that he forced her

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
out of the company and this would also

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
be a universe in which

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
some of my friends are still alive like

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
aaron swartz

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
and noreen plunkett and igol koshevoy

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
and i'm not going to share the stories

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
of those five people in detail

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
because i didn't put a content note on

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
this talk and i don't want to sideswipe

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,600
you emotionally more than i already have

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
but we have a bunch of work to do to

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,720
build the infrastructure of

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,240
inclusion along with the digital and the

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
financial and the legal and the other

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
social infrastructure

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
that we need to build to grow the health

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
of open source

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
that's the long term and it is our job

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,000
as residents of the universe to do our

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
bit

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,480
on those things but in the meantime

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,639
let's talk about some things

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,320
that are a little bit closer so i'm

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,680
going to tell you three stories

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,120
of some different futures these are

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
maybe things that could happen in the

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,639
next two to ten years and they require

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
smaller

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,959
changes in the world and after i tell

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,399
you each of these stories i'll tell you

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,120
what we would need to get there

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,320
new tools easier ways to hire certain

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,920
kinds of services

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,920
easier ways to share resources with

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,000
others and so on

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,040
so first a story of

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,040
local innovation

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,480
let's say that this is a future in which

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,680
the australian data science education

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,120
institute

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,920
has made more of an impact in the

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,160
world of people who teach science and

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,000
technology and engineering

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,040
because they know that real projects

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
give real motivation which means that if

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,480
you want people to learn how to do

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,199
things like data science

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,199
instead of giving them a toy project

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,880
give them real data to work with

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,800
something where if they work with it

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,000
it's going to make a real difference

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,399
in their neighborhood or to their group

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,639
so let's say in your city a local

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
education agency or non-profit thinks

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,240
well that's a great idea and they

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
start an initiative to help people do

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
project-based

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,199
learning to help improve their

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,880
programming and data science skills and

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,000
so they work with local activists to

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
come up with a bunch of

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
data science questions and they they pop

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,720
those opportunities open they

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,800
publicize what these questions are

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
especially to local institutions where

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
people

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
are trying to do project-based learning

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,320
and so there's you know a bunch of those

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
maybe the first idea that comes to mind

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
for you

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
is let's say montessori schools or

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
homeschoolers

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
right there are schools and unschools

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
where the the

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,959
curricula include independent study and

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,519
project

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,720
options people want to learn that way

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,320
but another group

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,639
that might be really interested in this

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
might be underdog devs

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
or the last mile and these are groups

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,480
where formerly incarcerated software

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,160
engineers and software engineers who are

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,399
still imprisoned

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,639
work on prisoner reentry through

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
retraining to work in the software

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,160
industry

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,920
or maybe uh the local data science

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
institutes and the local

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,320
activists could reach out to retraining

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
programs for returning veterans

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,759
who want to go from the military into

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,440
industry

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,800
so this local nonprofit the education

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
nonprofit they hire

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,399
a consultant for some initial project

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
management and open source training

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
so that the few people the few

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
montessori kids and

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
prisoner ex-prisoners doing re-entry and

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,959
veterans

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,720
the few people who said ah that project

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,959
who are working together

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
can get some help from a part-time

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,040
contractor

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,320
who helps run the project and who

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,079
helps them learn how to do open source

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
and the there were a bunch of different

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,759
project ideas but this project the one

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,839
that these particular five people

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:38,720
got interested in had to do with aeds

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,199
these people all live in a particular

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
city

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,279
and every person has a heart

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
but sometimes hearts uh go go a little

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,160
wonky right

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,600
now automated external defibrillators

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,600
are an amazing technology

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
on average when a person in the united

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
states calls 911

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,199
because someone suffered cardiac arrest

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
emergency medical responders get to the

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,959
scene in 8 to 12 minutes

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,120
but for people suffering cardiac arrest

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
for every minute the defibrillation is

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,600
delayed

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,199
the chance of survival goes down about

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,439
seven to ten percent

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,839
but automated external defibrillators

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
which is paddles that anyone can use and

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
they

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
you put them on someone's chest and if

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
it's a normal heart rhythm they don't

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,360
shock

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
but if it's the kind of heart rhythm

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,400
that could be shocked back into normal

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,280
then it says okay i'm going to do a

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,760
shock now

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,760
and bystanders even untrained ones who

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,240
use aeds on victims can save

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,039
lives and so that's why there are a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
bunch of these

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,799
public access defibrillation programs

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
all around the world

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
to make aeds more accessible in more

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,240
places

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
in train stations and police stations

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,280
and uh

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
gyms and swimming pools and some of

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
these franchise coffee shops and things

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,000
like that

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,280
but a ton of people do not know where

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
their nearest aed

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
is i bet you don't know uh and there are

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
some neighborhoods within any given city

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,039
that are probably aed deserts

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
so where are public a uh public access

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,080
aeds

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,600
and what's the distribution of them and

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,799
is there a desert is there a place where

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,360
we could put a few in

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,640
and they would really maximize how many

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
people would be able to get to them in

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,520
just a few minutes

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,960
that's the question that they start

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,520
asking so they need to learn some things

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,160
about geographic information systems and

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,919
playing with csvs and all that stuff

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
this project manager helps them out

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,720
um and is able to spin up a new project

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,120
quickly with a particular template of

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,440
issues and labels and so on that's

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,679
appropriate for a local project with a

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
few new learners

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,000
they're able to use sort of a cookie

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,160
cutter to re-copy

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,200
useful configuration settings issue

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
templates

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
labels milestones who has what

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,880
privileges

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
and so on it's very turn-key they don't

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,640
have to spend a bunch of time

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
making it themselves and another tool

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,039
that helps them as they grow this new

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
project

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,120
is an automated way to say hey we want

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
to capture

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,880
this decision this design rationale

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
so the project manager used this turnkey

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,679
tooling to create a minimal

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,039
read the docs website some documentation

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
for the project and in

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,280
an issue or a pull request if one of the

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,240
project collaborators

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,039
at mentions a bot then it makes a pull

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
request

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,600
that adds a markdown export of that

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,559
discussion

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
into a work in progress draft pull

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,080
request

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,120
that if merged would go into the read

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,919
the docs section

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,039
architectural history so the manager can

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
lightly edit that

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,520
and put it in the history of this these

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,039
set of design choices that they made

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,559
so that when new folks come along they

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,240
can understand

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,679
why the features in the structure are

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
what they are

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,720
and this consultant manager is only

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
part-time

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
but just in case there's suddenly a

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
flood of

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
new people who are interested maybe

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,480
because they get featured on the news or

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,919
something like that

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,400
this part-time manager can keep up using

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
a notification feed a dashboard of what

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,280
are people saying

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,200
what tickets are experiencing a big

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,799
spike of comments in the thread

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,559
is there a fire to be aware of these are

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,760
overview tools not just

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,400
oh here's a bunch of individual

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,240
notifications these are monitoring

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
tools for monitoring the flow and the

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
workload and it's unlikely for this

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,880
project that anything like this will

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,480
happen but it gives everyone

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,559
peace of mind so they learn right

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,799
these these five volunteers these five

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,880
learners plus their part-time helper

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,000
uh paid for by the educational

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
non-profit learn

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,280
they do something that's not innovative

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
right

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,720
there might be 50 other projects just

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
like this around the world but this is

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,200
theirs

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
and they made it and they understand it

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
and it's important to them and it helps

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,159
them

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
get some information that they use to

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,200
talk with

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,280
local city council members and agencies

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,559
to get some more public access aeds

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
placed into neighborhoods

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
that don't have as many and then spread

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,280
the word but they're available

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,400
and then once they're done with that um

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,000
a bunch of them said you know what we

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,880
should work on next

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,840
is cross-referencing transit and library

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
hours

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,919
to see who has a really hard time

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,559
getting via transit to

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,840
their local library while it's open and

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,600
they realize that

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
they probably don't need the consultant

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,760
anymore they know how to run the project

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,280
and if they find that they do want a

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,039
little extra expertise to help them out

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,520
they can reach out to an institution

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
that this consultant introduced them to

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,880
and it

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,799
protects freedom in concrete ways so if

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,520
there's some company that sues them for

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,280
breaking some

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,120
patent that they didn't even know about

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,280
this institution will help

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,200
help support and protect and defend them

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,880
it also provides platform support to

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,559
help developers do their work better

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
it offers financial infrastructure in

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,320
case they want a place to put donations

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,240
and a means to spend them

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,760
uh if they need some architectural

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
guidance or code review once in a while

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,039
someone can

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,760
drop by and or some tips on project

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,919
management

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
and in general this institution works on

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,640
recruiting new people

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,159
into the free software movement and

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,840
retaining them which has now

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,039
happened so think about what's different

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,000
in this story

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,000
compared to art world

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
one thing that jumps out to me and meant

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,440
not to you

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,919
is i think this story has better

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,200
collaboration

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,400
on technology projects creating funding

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,880
handing them off

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,600
providing infrastructure and so on among

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,240
different kinds of institutions

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
than we have in our world including

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,080
non-profits

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,440
a for-profit like this consultant

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
different kinds of educational

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
institutions

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,520
and so on there's a lot more fluid

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,200
collaboration including among the the

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
different non-profits some of which

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,960
happen on perhaps more of an educational

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
rhythm like the school calendar and some

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,480
of which don't

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,520
another is this is not oh let's fund a

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,240
hackathon

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,799
oh let's fund a weekend you know hack

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
day with a contest of some kind this is

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,919
not about that right

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
funding instead has gone into

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
infrastructure so that over the course

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,480
of possibly months

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,280
this project can succeed so that's not

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,000
just

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,240
the paying for the manager but also

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,440
paying possibly for the forge

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,039
because this forge has features that are

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,480
appropriate to this group including

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,000
possibly people who are under 13.

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,400
this is also an example of how an

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,880
ecology of consultancies

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,559
can change the interactions among

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,440
volunteers and companies other

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,600
institutions

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
because in this universe it's really

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,760
easy to hire

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
an open source project manager either a

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,280
freelancer or one from

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,520
kind of a temp agency who can help

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,279
people start to run a project

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,120
and help them learn what they need to

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,640
learn about open source engineering and

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
contribution

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,799
hi my name is sumina and i run changeset

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
consulting and you can hire me for this

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
sort of thing but it would be great if

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,760
there were

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,200
a lot more institutions like mine

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,919
at that institution that i mentioned at

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,760
the end there are a few that do a bunch

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,000
of those different things but i don't

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,919
think there is one institution that does

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,600
all of those things especially just for

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,080
little informal groups that might not

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
have

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,320
any particular legal entity finally

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,080
let's talk about the tooling

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,039
that i mentioned right which goes to

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,440
what adan mentioned in the introduction

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,360
so there's the ability to use this

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,200
cookie cutter approach to create

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,960
let's say a repository or project

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
whatever you might call it whose digital

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,760
workflow and scaffolding

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,840
is optimized to support one particular

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,880
purpose there's the help for a part-time

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,960
maintainer

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,720
by giving them not just notifications of

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,840
individual events

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,279
but monitoring right they're like the

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,440
system administrator but not of a

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,679
digital system but of a social system

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,159
right monitoring for the spikes and

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,400
fires to give them that overview

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
and then and this bit of tooling i i

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,640
really is close to my heart

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,640
the ease of capturing the design

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,799
rationale

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,919
if you ever read the excellent excellent

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,400
book making

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
software what really works and why we

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,960
believe it

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
which is a collection of research about

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,919
what works in software engineering

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,720
you'll see the number one thing that a

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,760
new contributor to a project needs

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,320
and has a really hard time getting is

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,520
the design

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,120
rationale behind bits of decisions why

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,200
did they do it this way

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,559
and why did they do it at all right

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,600
they're looking through code

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,200
well was it a deadline was it to fix a

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
bug or work around a bug

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
was somebody trying a new trying out a

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,120
new framework for fun

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,919
or what because that totally happens um

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,640
tools to capture this as you go

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,960
can surface it at a level that's higher

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,240
and

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
easier to read than commit logs and

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,320
comments

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,240
when you're trying to get the

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,000
architectural history

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,679
of the project this also then helps you

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
explain to other people who might

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,400
especially be contributing

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,960
in ways that are not code

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
including stakeholders from governments

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
so that's the first story

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,120
next i want to tell you a story about a

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,960
person

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,279
who becomes a user and then a

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
contributor and then a co-maintainer

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
of a project

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
which happens now but probably less like

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
this

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:24,000
than in this story

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,360
paula started at the dmv as a data entry

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,720
clerk and she thought maybe that was all

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,919
that she was going to end up doing

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,279
and well i guess that's okay but

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,320
in this universe municipalities and

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,520
states

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,600
are forming consortia um

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,720
different states will sometimes join a

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,400
consortium

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,799
to club together and fund an open source

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,200
replacement for not that great software

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,840
that a vendor has sold to them in the

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,799
past proprietary software

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,600
and different departments of motor

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,559
vehicles

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
in different united states mostly do the

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,919
same thing

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,640
so they realized well why don't we get

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,720
together and make some dmv software

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,320
so there's a consortium of eight states

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,400
that are pooling their money

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,240
to make this open source replacement for

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,760
their current proprietary vendor systems

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,159
and the code name for this

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,000
new software project is motorhead for

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,200
now they're thinking of changing

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,559
um and paula through her unionized

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,240
benefits

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:33,039
gets if she wants it training in

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,240
this new piece of software and a chance

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,840
to give

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
feedback right she's going to be one of

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,480
the users of this piece of software so

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,240
she gets asked hey do you want to be one

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
of the people who tries it out and gives

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
feedback and so she tries it out

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,360
there are things she likes there are

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,720
things that she thinks could be improved

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,240
and through the consortium and the dmv

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,720
and also her union

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,000
um she comes to understand that one of

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,960
the things that could happen is that she

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,120
could actually

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,880
help fix some of the things that she

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,320
doesn't like

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,919
so uh through again partly

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
in-house partly through the consortium

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,640
partly through the professional

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,080
development benefits

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,919
of her job uh she starts training up

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,640
on how to contribute to open source

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,720
software uh there is a textbook

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,080
and there's training material that helps

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,039
her learn some basic

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,399
engineering skills and she really loves

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,080
being able to pop the hood

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,080
and fix stuff that was annoying her also

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
she doesn't have to fight about

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
inclusive assumptions being made from

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,320
the start

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,080
both about the software's administrators

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,039
and users and about the kind of data

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,200
they're holding about

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,559
individual people whose data passes

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,640
through the system

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,159
from the very start uh it is assumed

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,039
that well sometimes people change their

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,399
names

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,240
including people who administer the

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,200
system some people

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,760
identify outside the gender binary

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,720
sometimes

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,200
individuals die and it's important to

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,200
make room for that and the various

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,039
data structures and workflows including

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,360
again people who administer the system

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,960
sometimes people get harassed and so

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,919
it's important when it comes to

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,080
information that's mostly public to be

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,000
able to move things sometimes

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,840
from private to public or vice versa and

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,399
be respectful of people's needs around

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,640
that and

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,840
to allow users to block harassers from

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,520
contacting them

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
all of these are things these are fights

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,320
that paula doesn't even have to have

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,520
that's already built into

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,240
the engineering assumptions so paula is

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,640
able to

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,799
switch into a role where she's doing a

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,399
lot less data entry and a lot more

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,480
i t and contribution as one of the

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,399
contributions that this particular dmv

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,679
makes to the consortium work and she

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,240
learns more about

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
what it's like to work together in a

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,120
project like this

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,880
and she finds out that the dmv offers as

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,880
a professional development benefit

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,640
a course offered by a training firm

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,679
where she could learn to be

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,840
one of the leaders one of the

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,159
maintainers of an open source project

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
so she thinks that would be pretty cool

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
so she goes in on this course and

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,840
there's a textbook

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,799
and there's also a playground basically

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,360
a sort of

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,240
sandbox where she can learn about issue

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,159
management and release management etc

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
and there's a trainer who takes her

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,520
through exercises

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,039
and assesses how she does on those

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,039
things and gives her feedback about how

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,559
she does so she learns

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,399
in a safe environment how to take

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,640
inventory of a project

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,720
clean out a bug tracker clean out the

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,399
old unreproducible bugs

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
look at a bunch of feature requests and

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,000
prioritize them

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
talk with users and find out more about

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,720
what they need

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,640
deprecate an api run a release including

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,559
navigating feature freeze and code

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,679
freeze run a meeting

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,000
make a budget and so on and

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,279
then uh when the people who are working

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,480
on the spread say oh great you're done

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
with that course come on why don't we

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,799
make you

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,960
an apprentice maintainer

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,120
she's able to work and participate

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
in a way that makes her feel safe

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,080
because she's backstopped right there's

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,960
a safety net

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,399
and that comes with the tooling

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
certainly it's the support it's the

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,519
emotional support

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,440
from other people and their willingness

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,279
to help but also the tools on that forge

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,559
oh they help her so much right

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,240
if she wants to write a reply to

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
something but she isn't super sure about

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
it

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,440
built into the platform is a way for her

00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,799
to share that note with her colleague

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,880
and say hey

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,320
could you check this and maybe edit it

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,559
and then as soon as that person

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,840
approves it or edits and approves it

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,159
lands into

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,279
the repository with her name on it right

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,960
it's just a way of getting

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,440
some editing and polishing help and

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,640
approval from her colleague

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
so she can gate her reviews replies and

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,799
emails on someone else's

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,519
approval or she can shadow them and

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,039
watch them

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
make a decision about how to reply to

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,480
something or they can you know somebody

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,760
can help her by ghostwriting

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,399
with her similarly one of the ways that

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,240
you save

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,480
time and sort of save your emotional

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,399
energy when you're replying to

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,480
what you know patches and pull requests

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,360
or issues or what have you is with saved

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,799
replies

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,120
saved responses and in this particular

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,440
forge it's very easy to share those

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,039
with your fellow maintainers so that

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,440
everybody can benefit from

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,279
the hard-won wisdom of how do you write

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,519
this quite the right way and it'll have

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,240
all the important links in it

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,840
and as she grows as she grows more

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,519
confident and doesn't need that

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,960
scaffolding as much anymore

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,480
and she's monitoring the community well

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,919
i don't like to use the word community

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
most of the time for these projects

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,080
because it's not

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
a group of people who know each other

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,919
and actually take care of each other but

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,760
as she's monitoring her constituencies

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,000
right the users and stakeholders and so

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
on there's a dashboard that helps her

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,080
notice

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,679
things that aren't happening that should

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
it's not just notifications of things

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,679
that are happening

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,159
it's also for instance hey that seemed

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,480
like it was an important conversation

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,320
and it stopped and it's gone stale and

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
quiet so that she can take a look and

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
see

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,320
is it that it should be marked resolved

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
or do we need to push and

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,519
rephrase this so that we can get the

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,000
conversation going again

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,320
or let's say there's a person who was

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,360
contributing and participating regularly

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,000
and has now gone quiet she can check in

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,039
on what's happening with that person

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,519
along the way as she's learning to use

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,480
and contribute to and then co-maintain

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,799
motorhead she goes to a conference and

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,320
then the next year she sprints at it and

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,159
works with people during a hack week and

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,000
then the next year she speaks

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,919
she gives a talk of that conference this

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,679
is a conference that's hosted by

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,120
a free and open source software

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,159
organization this is actually the

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,600
organization

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,480
that lobbied for the procurement rule

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,880
change

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
in state government that allowed this

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,880
consortium to happen

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,519
and this org has a really wide purview

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,159
so there's

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,440
a lot of cross-pollination at this

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,360
conference people

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,559
are working on the technology side but

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
they're also working on all the other

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,480
things it takes

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,560
to liberate people with technology

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,639
there's talks and workshops about

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,200
fundraising and money management

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,639
effective public speaking and writing uh

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,560
people are planning together about

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,200
how we liberate users by giving them

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,639
high quality free software platforms and

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,639
apps and services

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,720
uh some people are sharing compelling

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
new visions and articulations

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,399
for the free software movement as

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,280
circumstances change right new

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,480
new metaphors new fronts to fight in uh

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,119
there's summits by people who are

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,440
lobbying

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,599
to change more procurement rules and

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,520
also educational curricula

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,879
standards around the us and around the

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
world and

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,159
there are efforts there are many uh sort

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,079
of hack

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
weeks and sprints and workshops and

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,040
hallway conversations about

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,879
growing the number and types of

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,879
volunteers who contribute to crucial

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,480
free software projects and making

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,079
strategic choices to improve free

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,400
software infrastructure and

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,800
recruiting and successing recruiting and

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,560
mentoring successor leaders like her

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,720
uh you get the idea oh and no one

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,560
harasses her at this conference which

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,640
she does not notice

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,800
because it's easy not to notice the

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,280
absence of a thing like that

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,480
so paula helps get this new system

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,599
production ready

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,160
and it replaces the old proprietary

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,880
system

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,520
and she makes it implements a really big

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,560
decision

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,720
after that which is that a project can

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,680
have rather an instance right of

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,320
motorhead

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,480
can handle beginning to trust another

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,160
instance from another state

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,880
and implement business logic so we can

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,680
handle both sides of a person moving

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
from one state to another so that

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,599
motorhead can coordinate

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,960
automatic re-registration of a person

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,520
new license

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,359
new voter registration and so on and

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,240
paul is now a trusted expert within the

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,400
consortium

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,480
and people ask whether she'll come join

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,160
a worker co-op that offers migration

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,119
services for the various us states that

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,400
are designing a switch

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,000
deciding to switch to motorhead and that

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,520
would be an interesting change but she

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,160
really doesn't like to travel so she's

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,160
thinking about it

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,280
so what's different in this universe

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,280
again because i think so much about

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,079
institutions the consortia right more

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,040
than having

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,440
all these uh procurement rule changes

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,480
for

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,000
public government funded agencies

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,839
so that people from different

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,720
municipalities and states and so on can

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,680
get together

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,680
and create a consortium that's not

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,079
happening nearly enough right now

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,280
my spouse leonard richardson works on an

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,000
effort

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,040
called library simplified where public

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,079
libraries

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,720
in lots of places can join together uh

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,240
to make lending ebooks easier and use

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,720
open source and open standards to save

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,599
money

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,520
and control their own destiny also the

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,560
worker co-ops again

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,680
some of these exist but they're not

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,200
nearly as common as they could be

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,040
another thing that uh you know is not as

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,079
much the case as i would like it to be

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,280
is having those inclusive assumptions

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,400
from the start now in this case because

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,079
this is software

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
that has to do with personal data at the

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,440
department of motor vehicles

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,880
okay maybe it's more likely that a lot

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,000
of those inclusive assumptions would be

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,560
baked in

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,240
but also the next wordpress the next get

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,200
the next tour

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,920
ideally in healthy open source they also

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,520
don't have these perceptual gaps about

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,839
who uses it and what their needs are

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,160
likely to be

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,839
consultants and training companies exist

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,200
in this universe that provide training

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,760
on how to be a contributor

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,760
and how to be a maintainer there is not

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,839
that much of that right now and it's a

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,920
big gap that makes it harder for us to

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,160
grow the leadership that we need

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,119
for successors in free and open source

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,839
software leadership

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,440
so i've actually written a bit of a spec

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,119
which i think there's a link to i hope

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,200
on twitch now for the software

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,480
we will need to have real interactive

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,079
sandbox training

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,320
to teach maintainership skills without

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,079
someone having to learn everything from

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,480
a real life project and i am working on

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,920
basically the textbook on how to come

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,000
into an existing

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,920
free software project and become a

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,640
co-maintainer and help get the project

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
unstuck

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,599
if it needs to and you can actually

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
download a sample of that right now for

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,520
free

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,119
some tooling this again uh there's

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,760
tooling to help maintainers share the

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,280
burden

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,800
there's tooling to help people teach

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
each other or cross check each other's

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,200
work

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,720
and tooling to notice the dog that

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,240
didn't bark again this is almost the

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
converse of what i said in the previous

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,320
story

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,119
about notifications right what a great

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,040
conference

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
that sounds like now i haven't been to

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,599
an in-person conference for more than a

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,599
year so maybe i've just made up a

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,200
disneyland in my head

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
oh this is the conference that i want to

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,800
go to but this is

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,400
inheriting from the legacy of open

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,079
source bridge and open source and

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,960
feelings and oscon

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,480
and also uh something that you can get

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,480
sometimes with an allied media

00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,359
conference and siegel and libra planet

00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
all of

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,359
i just want like a big combination of

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,440
all these things and the institution

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,280
that hosts that uh i think it doesn't

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
exist i think there's different

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,320
institutions that do a lot of those

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,440
including the wikimedia foundation for

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,760
instance but

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,440
yeah uh we need more of it i don't know

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,599
whether it should be in one

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
house or a bunch of different ones but

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
at least right now for instance the free

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,079
software foundation

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,000
is not that and the last story that i'll

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,599
share with you is the story of a legacy

00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,240
project that

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,440
fails except i don't know if it is

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,119
actually a fail

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,119
failure maybe it's just an ending

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,760
so sean is the maintainer of a

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,320
drupal instagram integration helps you

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,599
reuse photos from instagram into drupal

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,119
and sean maintains a lot of stuff right

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,920
and it's made somewhat easier by the

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,880
fact that there

00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,800
are user groups user counsels who can

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
help them a bit with

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,400
some some money and also some help with

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,000
things that don't require him right

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,000
user-to-user help

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,319
in the forums and cleaning up the bug

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,280
tracker and things like that but even so

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,800
you know it takes work as these apis

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,920
change and things like that

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,920
so sean has taken on more and more and

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,680
he realizes one day that he's

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,960
feeling a little more burned out feeling

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,920
kind of exhausted

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
and a friend of his instead of sending

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,480
him

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,119
some list of 10 productivity hacks

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,560
uh does uh perhaps a kinder thing and

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,280
actually takes some time to sit down

00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,400
with him

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,800
and do a responsibility on just

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,680
big list of what are all the open source

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,800
things

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,280
that you're responsible for right now

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,040
and there's a lot on that list and sean

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,680
realizes that this

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,119
instagram drupal integration is just not

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
where he wants to be putting his time he

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,560
needs

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,079
to concentrate on fewer things that have

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,240
a higher priority to him

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,480
and so at the next solstice

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,680
he uses the open source tradition that

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
has arisen

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,400
that twice a year at the solstices

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,720
there's a responsibility amnesty day

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,839
which is the day when you can just say

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,480
hey

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,680
i can't keep doing this anymore so i'm

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,800
putting it down

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,800
and everyone understands so

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,680
he does that at the next solstice and

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,319
his user castle basically says well crap

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,400
okay people recognize that every open

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,280
source project has a life cycle

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,280
that includes an end and that that is

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,160
natural that at some point every project

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,960
is going to come to an

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,400
end there's a fairly easy governance and

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,640
decision mechanism

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,079
that this user stakeholder council can

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,920
use to confer

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,280
and say well what are we going to do

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,240
about this and if they come to no

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,800
decision

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,280
then the null slash default that's going

00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,599
to happen

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,200
is that after they fail to come to a

00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,359
decision during the election

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,280
and discussion and deliberation period

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,440
then well the project's just going to go

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,000
read-only and that's just how it is

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,200
but and so they assess their ability and

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,560
collective desire

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,160
to maintain it themselves or hire or

00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,119
support a new maintainer and in this

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,800
case

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,240
they don't want to do that not enough

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,319
people want to

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,680
contribute enough in order to make that

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,040
happen because enough of them think well

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,920
in the next five years or so i'll be

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,720
moving off either

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,280
drupal or instagram but they do want to

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,760
use

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,040
their collective power to make an easier

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,160
migration path

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,800
for themselves and so they hire

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,200
as a one-time and smaller cost an

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,720
end-of-life consultant

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,119
this person looks at their project

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,000
looks for competitors updated

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,119
descendants

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,880
and replacements and forks figures out

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,160
maybe what it would take for possibly

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,560
merging with

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,000
another project or uh how hard it's

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,319
going to be to migrate people

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,720
onto the various alternative services

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,880
and rustles up some consultancies to get

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,200
prices so that now the users know

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,800
what their options are for buying paid

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,400
migration services if that's what they

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,880
want to do

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,880
and then after all that is done

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,240
after a little bit of time for everybody

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,000
to kind of say their goodbyes on this

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,359
one project

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,280
it's moved to archive mode the code

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,880
is moved to the software heritage data

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,440
set

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,119
and moved off of the active area of

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,560
platform so people don't stumble on it

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,040
and think oh i should use this it's

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,040
still

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,640
maintained no it's clear that it's not

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,760
everybody gets to concentrate on

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,079
projects with the future

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,800
and sean gets to lay down one of his

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,400
burdens

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
so that he can work on the things that

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,200
he wants to

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,720
so what's different about this i think

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,040
one of the differences between

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,920
this healthier open source industry and

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,599
the one we're in

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,040
is a general understanding that burnout

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,760
is really serious and needs to be

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,480
addressed

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,800
through reduction of burdens and not

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,240
just

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,880
be more productive stuff really curious

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,359
what people think of this amnesty day

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,359
idea

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,440
in case it speaks to you the solstice is

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,920
in 2021

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,920
uh at least in my area are june 21st and

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,240
december 21st

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,440
uh take that as you will okay so my

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,960
spouse leonard

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,240
heard this idea and said you know this

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,119
is the kind of thing that might not work

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
in real life

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,960
because then we're squeezing together a

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,160
bunch of sudden end of life

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,319
this is no longer maintained

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,760
announcements onto just two days a year

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,760
and it might be hard for the users and i

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,119
said but maybe this would be good

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,119
because then people would know to look

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,200
out for those days

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,160
right and say oh i gotta check uh the

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,720
day after

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,000
uh you tell me tell me what you think i

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,480
think it would be great if there were

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
better

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
tooling for democratic governance or at

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,160
least you know better

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,359
shared resource stakeholder decision

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,400
making built

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,960
into the platforms that we use and this

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,800
is like

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,400
the stuff that shauna gordon mckeon is

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,119
working on with glitzen

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,880
and concord which i hope there will be

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,440
some links shared in the twitch

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,640
um also eleanor ostrom's work lewis

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,760
via's work

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,280
um you know this is all stuff that much

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,200
people have thought a lot about and

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,680
written a lot about but

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,520
my point is that if this user counsel

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,880
can exist and can make these kinds of

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,319
deliberative decisions

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,599
quickly and easily because it's built

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,000
into the platform that also makes reuse

00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
more

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,359
possible because then users

00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
stakeholders don't think i'm going to go

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,160
reinvent the wheel because at least i

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,680
know i'll have control over that i'll

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,200
have a voice in that no

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,680
if people know that they can have a

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,880
voice in the software that they use

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,720
and they can materially support it then

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,760
they know that they can

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,920
actually reuse and stick with it right

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,839
now a note about this tooling this is

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,440
possibly a kind of forge that's

00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,880
fundamentally different

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,040
from the kind of forge the kind of

00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,839
platform that another kind of project

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,359
might need you know uh an open source

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,359
project that's made by a company that's

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,359
just throwing the code over the wall

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,480
they don't need this governance stuff

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,119
right because they they're the

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,720
governance

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,720
you look at the open tech strategies

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,480
archetypes that they did with mozilla

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,920
you think about how a business to

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,240
business project

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,960
is different from a mass market project

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,480
different from a

00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,079
specialty library which is different

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,720
from a trusted vendor

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,160
um nadia eggball and i have some

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,960
thoughts about her book in case people

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,119
want to talk about it

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,960
but she suggests um you know these

00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,760
categories of toy club federation

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,760
stadium

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
based on the ratios of users and

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,800
contributors and user growth and

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,520
contributor growth so isn't it likely

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,720
that they need really different things

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,680
and perhaps monopolies and monocultures

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,720
in our platforms wouldn't help with this

00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,839
right because they're kind of brittle

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,160
and they get to be one size fits

00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,240
none another thing that happens

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,839
in this story is the existence of this

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,599
end of life consultant

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,119
as hard as it is to find consultants who

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,000
can help you start a project it's even

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,079
harder

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,839
to help consultants who will help you

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,359
end one in a graceful way

00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,359
if you look at what the digital impact

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,400
alliance has funded in the past in its

00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,800
strategic grants

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,440
they include product consolidation and

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,280
managing

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,359
upstream dependencies and downstream

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,880
forks it is a lot easier

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,560
to find grants and funding and

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,119
consultants to help you start a new

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,599
project

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,880
as hard as that is then to help find

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,960
that kind of support

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,880
to end a project that needs to stop

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,880
gracefully and it would be healthier

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,599
for everyone if there were funded

00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,319
pathways and more hirable experts

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,200
to help you end stuff and migrate people

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,680
onto the next

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,160
path and finally i just want to bring

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,000
your attention to the software heritage

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,359
approach not just the code but also

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,319
conversations

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,520
getting archived so in conclusion

00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,079
there's so much

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,319
i haven't even touched on in this talk

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,760
right i haven't even discussed in detail

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,319
uh the problems with having a single

00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,440
proprietary point of failure for

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,520
so much of the whole open source ecology

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,760
the importance of ease of import and

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,880
export of all the artifacts associated

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,040
with the project including

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,319
conversations where we actually make our

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,160
engineering decisions

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,319
the kind of resilience that comes from

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,319
having cross-dependent projects

00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,680
hosted on different forges i haven't

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,160
talked about copyleft

00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,160
and licenses and these new not really

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,200
open source licenses that some companies

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,440
are adopting

00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,599
and like venture capital funded

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,680
platforms that get to outspend their

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,000
rivals for years to gain market share

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,240
and how

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,440
that impacts these dynamics i really

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,920
have not talked enough

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,520
about the international nature of open

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,880
source software and

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,559
you know this goes all the way from the

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,839
problem of conferences in the united

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,720
states and europe that are not

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,400
accessible

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,920
to people from many countries such as

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,400
nigeria because they can really get

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,599
visas all the way to our collective

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,280
failure to

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,520
use free software and free culture to

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,640
help liberate people in myanmar china

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,440
and elsewhere

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,400
but i do know there's a lot to do to

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,280
reduce

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,359
the exhaustion and burn out exploitation

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,040
and the unreliability and unpred

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,559
under production of essential

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,640
infrastructure and the waste

00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,720
of the open source software industry and

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,040
i hope i really sketched out some ways

00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,480
that they these things could be improved

00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,720
and mitigated

00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,839
and if we actually do make this field

00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,839
healthier

00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,599
then people a generation from now will

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:15,599
look back and say

00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,599
wow you got so much wrong

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,200
right they they'll look at us the way we

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,400
look at people from

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,240
uh you know ago as as a gag

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,680
people who have been doing open stuff

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,240
for decades will

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,599
send their less senior friends links to

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,440
things that happened

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,559
right uh to left pad and heart bleed

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,359
and the timeline of incidents and the

00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,240
firings of people unionizing at npm and

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,839
so much more

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,960
and anticipate that they did what

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,000
replies the next generation of open

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,240
source participants will

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,079
look back at people like me and they

00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,040
will keenly observe

00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,520
what we missed what we got wrong this

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,319
talk

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,599
will be a laughingstock right look at

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,000
how late we were

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,359
to form consortia and co-ops to support

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
projects we cared about

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,400
look at how slow we were to take

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,000
advantage of these market opportunities

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,760
for different kinds of training

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,040
and consulting businesses look at where

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,599
we were too complicit

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,720
in intersecting oppressions endemic to

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,640
our society

00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,640
and too accepting of the ridiculously

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,760
skewed tax policy in the united states

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,520
ridiculously skewed

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,440
economics of the industry look at where

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,400
we were just too much of

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,400
generally too much of our time and that

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,839
will mean that we've actually

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,520
done reasonably well so thank you

00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,680
uh to listening thank you to mike

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,040
piernon and nick murphy for listening to

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,040
some rehearsals and to

00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,640
leonard richardson fight heller sue

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,280
somerset lindsey cooper

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,240
julian horvath and marie clemency for

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,079
some discussions

00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,920
over the course of the past year or so

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,359
that helped me with these ideas uh thank

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,359
you for listening and now i would

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,359
welcome your questions so idan

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,440
thank you semina that was fantastic and

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,319
i would like to remind everybody that we

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,400
have

00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,520
uh i will put it on the screen there we

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,160
go we have

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,839
the octa discussion uh i've already got

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,040
a couple questions going on in there

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:11,119
um okay uh i

00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,040
i wanted to ask a little bit about sort

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,480
of uh you talked about

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,200
these overview or monitoring tools

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,640
um uh i've struggled with my github

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,280
notifications for years and

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,559
sure everybody loves to hate on uh

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,319
github notifications

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,480
in particular in a gold deluxe kind of

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,800
way you know they're

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,319
not the right abstraction um you're

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,079
talking here about notifications that

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,800
are on a different scale cutting across

00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,319
tooling

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,160
and helping me get a sense for what the

00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,760
community wants and i have sort of two

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,920
related questions there

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,319
it sounds first like this is something

00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,480
one step removed from github because

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,400
it looks at other sources of information

00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,160
not just the commit stream but also

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,720
other kinds of interactions

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,400
not just conversations and pull requests

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,960
so the first question i have is what are

00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,000
those

00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,079
those other sources of information and

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,280
i think uh maybe related like you know

00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,680
on the way to that

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,520
you highlighted what's active right now

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,880
you know i'd love to talk a little bit

00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,680
more about that lens

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,280
why is what's active so important

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,040
because this implies this sort of like

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,119
one-way signal like you know

00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,640
um i'm the leader i must watch where my

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,240
people are going so that i may lead them

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,720
you know

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,359
what what about the opposite direction

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,880
um

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,520
you know is uh how do we also give a

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,280
return

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,040
channel for maintainers to contributors

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,760
as part of this that it's not just about

00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,160
like okay what's going on but also

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,920
how do i help shape this and how do we

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,480
give these maintainers those tools i

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,160
know that's

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,240
that's a big that's a whole big solution

00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,160
space so we can break that down but um

00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,359
i'm curious what you think about those

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,520
sure um so

00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,559
i think that the first thing that you've

00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,079
just said

00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:57,280
about um what are these other sources

00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,160
of data that notifications um you know

00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,760
that we might want to

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,520
look at for a dashboard like this i

00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,559
think a really good source

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:08,079
for thinking about this is probably the

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,839
chaos project that c-h-a-o-s-s

00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,599
for people who don't know this is a

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,280
working group that is trying to really

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,359
think in a very systematic way

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,839
about metrics in open source software

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,640
um and they are uh sometimes you know

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,040
assisted by

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,400
a consultancy called betergia that have

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,680
thought a lot about

00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,240
what are all the different sources of

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,280
information that you might want to grab

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,079
archive analyze reproduce and so on from

00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
an open source

00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,559
software project so you know there's

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,359
stuff that happens on a platform like

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,079
github

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:42,000
uh or on a you know get lab launch pad

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,599
source hut and so on

00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,559
um and then there's conversation that

00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,880
happens

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,920
because we exist on the internet and so

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,319
these are going to be

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,760
in some cases social media notifications

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,599
sometimes these will be individual

00:53:53,760 --> 00:54:00,720
personal email or discord or slack

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,040
conversations i think that

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,640
places where you know people are talking

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,880
about the project

00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:12,160
could widely vary to you know reddit

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,720
email individual as i mentioned

00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,760
discords and certainly stack overflow

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,640
for instance

00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,160
so a thing that i think is probably a

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,440
bit of a holy grail that i don't know

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,400
whether it actually exists

00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,240
is something that helps me see all that

00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,280
i looked recently at the

00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,400
hey hey email service

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,000
and the various choices it makes about

00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,839
what it's doing to try to surface to you

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,280
the conversations that you need to know

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,680
about and the messages you need to know

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,480
about

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,079
so that your inbox isn't just the world

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,359
writable to-do list

00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,119
right um and i think i struggled a lot

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,559
emotionally with thinking about because

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,119
i've been using email

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,079
the way that most people have right for

00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,680
a great majority

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,640
of my life but rethinking the user

00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,599
control

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,119
over what they see um and hooking in

00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,440
maybe things like zapier

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,720
to look at these other data sources

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,119
might be might be interesting

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,400
to try and create that okay where is it

00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,760
and then when you mention

00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,480
why you know talk about this whole

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,760
active thing um

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,359
i think that the

00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,760
tell me about something that's gotten

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,359
really active really does feel like

00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:26,400
a capacity to fight fires to me

00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:30,160
it feels like a way to know

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,760
in a way that

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,359
isn't just oh i've gotten a bunch of

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,839
individual notifications about this

00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:38,240
thing but has a higher abstraction level

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,839
the question of is this something that i

00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,599
need to step in on because

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:45,839
tempers have gotten heated um or because

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,280
people are making a decision faster than

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,520
they should

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,960
that is that is the intuition that i

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,480
have about that on

00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,000
you know sort of first thought about why

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,559
do i why do i think that's

00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,640
that's the case i also think that it

00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,520
usually shouldn't just be something

00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,079
that one maintainer has to monitor right

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,960
this might

00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,760
also make sense as a kind of a bat

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,640
signal

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,680
for people who care about a project who

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,799
can include

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,839
um curators and power users and stuff

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,920
like that

00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:20,319
mm-hmm um so

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,760
i mean sort of built into that though is

00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,400
is i think a problem that we're

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,960
grappling

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,599
with right now which is that you know

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,880
like

00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,319
x doesn't scale you know um uh

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,079
seminar doesn't scale there's only

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:34,000
there's only one um

00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,839
and for many contributors or many

00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,960
maintainers um

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,440
uh if i were to walk up to them you know

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,440
i

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,720
i'm assuming i'm presuming but if i were

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,160
to walk up to them and be like here's

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,839
some more tooling for you to monitor

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,240
they'd be like oh no go away

00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,880
um because i don't i don't have the

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,599
bandwidth

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,240
um to get into it um and i think this

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,240
may be

00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,839
um and you'll mention you'll notice by

00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,520
the way don that both

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,640
of the maintainers that i talked about

00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,359
when i talked about this kind of tooling

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,359
were both paid

00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,920
and that's a huge difference as well is

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,680
that some of the maintainers who

00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,760
don't have time and are being burned out

00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,559
here they are not being compensated for

00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,680
their labor

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
and so that's that's tough well it's

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,920
difficult to work

00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,559
multiple jobs um this is this is not

00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,920
something

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,799
new or specific to software um

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,640
so absolutely um and i think it maybe

00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:30,240
ties in a little bit to

00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:33,520
the uh the story you described around

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:36,559
this new contributor persona paula

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,559
and apprenticeship

00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,079
because

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,760
i think one of the problems that people

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,680
have when contributing to

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,359
um open source software or actually the

00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,359
other side of it is maintainers

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,960
is that contributors you know come

00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,799
through especially on popular projects

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,160
and they're like oh i want to contribute

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,200
but to the maintainer

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,720
it's very difficult to sort out who's

00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,480
just passing through you know they're

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,000
interested and maybe they lose interest

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,000
as soon as they encounter

00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,760
the actual difficulty and need to chew

00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,359
on on hard things and

00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,040
who's actually like you know going to be

00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,160
there for the long run and without

00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,559
passing judgment

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,160
about how people contribute maintainers

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,319
are people too and the the time that

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,480
they spend cultivating new contributors

00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,000
it it's opportunity cost they can't be

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,599
in two conversations at once they can't

00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,720
be reviewing prs

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:27,680
while they're holding somebody's hand so

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,119
uh like if if you're talking about like

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,400
you know wave a magic wand you get to

00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,559
edit reality

00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,000
and you know open source grows up in a

00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,319
slightly different fashion

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,440
what what's different in that timeline

00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,440
is this like a

00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,359
like a world in which this

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,559
apprenticeship starts as

00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:46,480
onboarding classes for open source um

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,160
even if we sort of like magic away the

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,440
issue of compensation where people are

00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,960
compensated for the time

00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,040
if you want to make a living doing open

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,559
source you can do so

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,720
and maybe you're not going to be you

00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,400
know capital w wealthy but you know

00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,440
you'll be able to earn a living wage

00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,440
doing so

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:05,520
um uh is is that sort of

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,200
the entry point i mean i don't know that

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,720
much about how apprenticeship really

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,240
worked back in the day

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:13,760
um but what does what does this

00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,040
alternate reality look like

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,119
where um there's a scalable model for

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,160
onboarding people into open source

00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,160
that doesn't end up in the trap of

00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,599
maintainers only have 24 hours in the

00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,280
day and they need to spend

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,440
a bunch of them working and a bunch of

00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,520
them sleeping and a bunch of them on

00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,119
personal whatever and where do they also

00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,680
have time to like you know handhold a

00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,680
million people

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,280
um i think part of what you would see is

00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,559
um

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:46,640
so when you think about carpentry

00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:49,599
or athletics or music um

00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,280
generally there is a wide bunch i think

00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:54,400
of open source you know if

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:58,160
if two different um people

00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,040
say oh um i'm learning the guitar or i

00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,960
play the guitar

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,400
you don't really know the context in

01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,839
which they play the guitar

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,520
are they playing it for themselves to

01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,920
amuse themselves are they

01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,280
in a band that actually tours you know

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,280
are they a teacher

01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,119
are they you know are they writing a

01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,119
song for a specific

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,400
you know company project or something

01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,520
like that um

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:23,200
so in open source as well

01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:26,319
uh the the projects

01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:30,720
that get a tremendous number

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:35,359
of views and stuff like that um

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:38,480
we have right now an assumption that

01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,240
every single one has the same interface

01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,000
right but you don't have the same

01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,319
interface to

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,040
beginning violin and like watching yo-yo

01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,280
ma

01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,760
right you don't have the same interface

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,040
to beginning to do a little woodworking

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:55,200
on your own in your garage versus you

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,799
know watching a master wood sculpture

01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,400
or or participation learning to take

01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:01,440
those classes or something like that

01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,280
right um and

01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,520
i think that in this universe where i

01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,240
get to like wave my magic wand

01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,440
um the people who have different

01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,319
motivations

01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,880
for participating in different projects

01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,720
have

01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,400
appropriate substitutes available

01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,400
um this is kind of like just an in

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,520
general right you see um

01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,280
libraries in the united states

01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,880
become like the branch libraries the

01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,960
physical locations

01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,240
um they become these substitutes where

01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,160
like that's just where a tremendous

01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,599
number of social services happen

01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,119
so this is where people end up having ad

01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,000
hoc day care

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,559
or schools as well right that's where

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,400
food

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,760
gets administered to hungry people and

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,200
that's where music classes happen and

01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
that's where counseling happens and so

01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,240
on and so on

01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,760
and so when we had to uh shut down the

01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,480
physical locations of theory schools and

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
libraries

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,839
uh during the pandemic it was terrible

01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,119
because we had like

01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:59,920
monolith these things right um

01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,599
and so somewhat similarly if all these

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,559
different needs that different people

01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,240
have

01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:09,599
for learning for ambition

01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:12,559
uh for entertainment and so on

01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,680
if there aren't alternate substitute

01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,680
approaches

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,440
for them to take then they're going to

01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,400
end up going to open source projects i

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,520
sometimes talk about

01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,839
the ambition taboo in the tech industry

01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,079
how

01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:26,480
in general since we don't have good ways

01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:29,200
of assessing people's talent

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,319
uh in a way that is uh you know fungible

01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,920
and transferable

01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:35,200
from one place to another we we you

01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,640
don't have something like medicine where

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,599
you have the board exams

01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,960
right um instead all we have is sort of

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,240
have you ever been the maintainer of an

01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,680
open source project

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,280
have you gotten a contribution into an

01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,680
open source project have you given a

01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,280
talk

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,280
at a major conference have you written a

01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,440
book have you gotten hired by

01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,119
a company that we think is prestigious

01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,119
and to a somewhat lesser extent

01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,720
have you gotten a cs degree from one of

01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,160
these like five universities but even

01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,440
that doesn't matter as much

01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:03,280
um and so if we had

01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,760
uh you know if i could believe a magic

01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,400
wand there'd be a lot more work being

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,440
done

01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,319
on how we can do good assessment and how

01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,880
we have

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,000
other places for people who want to you

01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,400
know aim for

01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,599
ambition for mastery and validation of

01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,960
that mastery

01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:23,520
that doesn't then have to get possibly

01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,960
um you know interfere with people who

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,720
are trying to do work for for other

01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,760
motivations that's like an example right

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,359
and then when i talk about like

01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,960
music or athletics or woodworking or

01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,559
something like that you know people who

01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,599
engage in lots of different ways

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,960
uh end up being on different platforms

01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,240
that act in different ways

01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,280
and the interfaces for hey do you want

01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,319
to join in

01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,880
are shaped in in different ways um

01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:51,839
i do think that uh there's a place for

01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,599
um for instance uh if you're a really

01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,960
popular open source project

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,640
and then people keep knocking on your

01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,720
door you know what you should have you

01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,920
should have subsidized assistance

01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,839
who help right like why should yeah

01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,599
like if you're in it as a maintainer

01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,480
because you primarily want to be writing

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,319
features and

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,839
fixing you know fixing bugs and

01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:11,119
reviewing code and stuff like that

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,280
then wouldn't it be great if you could

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,720
have assistants like me you know i am

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,359
someone who can be hired to do stuff

01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,400
like this

01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,920
to help with the stuff that is not

01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,559
really in your purview

01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,839
um so that kind of work that and that is

01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,039
something that

01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,440
uh companies can do to hire and to help

01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,440
out

01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,280
the projects that they want to help who

01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,240
are feeling overwhelmed in some way

01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,839
um so we don't have to close it off and

01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,760
make it all a one-way mirror

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,880
or something like that right we can

01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,920
instead uh

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,240
adjust not just expectations through

01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,280
uh certain kinds of platform friction

01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,559
and certain kinds of you know

01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,960
expectation setting

01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,160
in text and things like that we can also

01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,559
subsidize

01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,599
all of the helpers all of the assistants

01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,000
who can help

01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,760
work with new contributors and there's

01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,480
actually some stuff in my upcoming book

01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,319
about how you work with like somewhat

01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,480
lower effort ways to work with

01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,000
contributors who you know are coming to

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,200
you with uh who need a lot of guidance

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,079
and maybe you're providing pretty four

01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,440
patches this is

01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,880
this is not an insoluble problem

01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,720
yeah i'm sorry that really went all over

01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,960
the place into a lot of stuff

01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,400
it did but i mean there there there is a

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,720
lot of stuff and it's not

01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,760
it's not a strictly you know easy to

01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,920
sort of like wrap

01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,880
wrap your head around it i've seen you

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,839
know on the subject of

01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,520
of certifications um there's

01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,960
certifications for certain parts of our

01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,520
industry you know it's like if you want

01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,559
to be

01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:37,280
a cisco certified networking expert then

01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,599
you pay cisco a whole bunch of money and

01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,119
then

01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,880
at some point you get a little like

01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,520
diploma that says like i'm

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,000
i'm i'm not terrible at this job and you

01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,599
can

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,880
you can get this kind of certification

01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,960
for a lot of different things but they

01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,200
tend to be very industry focused

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,960
like you know it's like if you want very

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,960
specific to like a particular

01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,039
uh subset a particular framework usually

01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,880
a particular commercial product

01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,559
exactly like you know it's like i know

01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,359
how to administer salesforce

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,240
and i have the you know the the diploma

01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,799
to prove it

01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,640
um uh and it costs me quite a bit of

01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:10,480
money to to buy that diploma

01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,680
which obviously likes you know excludes

01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,160
a lot of people but

01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,119
um but there there has been sort of talk

01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,240
over the years of

01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,200
of uh if we think of the crafting

01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,559
of software as a trade like a lot of

01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,359
other building trades

01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,799
you know if you want to be an

01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,400
electrician you have to be a licensed

01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,640
electrician if you want to be

01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,240
you know you have to be a licensed

01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,079
whatever exactly that there's

01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,599
maybe there's room for something like

01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,440
boards

01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,440
so that there's a way to um

01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:44,880
independently evaluate people um

01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,480
we have time for one one last question

01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,000
i should say that i wasn't thinking of

01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,520
certification i was thinking

01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,920
that this kind of course would basically

01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,640
be more about you've done you've gotten

01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,440
the skills

01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,640
and that ideally it would not be

01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,240
something where people would you know

01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,880
yeah want that certification for their

01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,880
wall

01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,319
but i recognize that when you set up a

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,640
course then you know there are things

01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:07,920
that might emerge around it

01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,559
right um one last question

01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,799
you keep coming back to um this tooling

01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,599
built into and you say the forge

01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:16,319
the forge being um sort of a generic

01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,839
name for

01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:21,599
a github or a sourceforge or a gitlab or

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,200
you know the sort of the platform of

01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,160
collaboration for

01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,119
for software development um and this

01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,119
tooling to help

01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,200
you know identify what needs to be

01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,240
worked on to mediate communication

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,359
between

01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,880
contributors to a project um maybe also

01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,520
to capture things that happen out of

01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,039
bend

01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,319
you know you say like what if i have a

01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,680
slack conversation with somebody and

01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,559
then i need to bring it into

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,760
the system or i have some other kind of

01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,599
communication

01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,359
um if these things are built into the

01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,000
platform then is the fitness of that

01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:53,280
thing

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,720
about satisfying most users and if they

01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,240
aren't built into the platform then who

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,119
owns it is it just another open source

01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,280
project like

01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,480
how do we how do we not end up with the

01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,280
the xkcd

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,000
problem of like now we have 15 um

01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,960
different

01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,640
competing standards um like you know

01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,680
it's like i'm gonna have one

01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,839
one system to to tie it all together

01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,039
and now we have you know one more system

01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,719
how do we not end up

01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,319
with with that kind of thing what do we

01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:22,400
do that's gonna drive

01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,239
towards maybe not consolidation into

01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,679
one single thing you know that's also

01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:27,359
bad a monoculture but

01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,120
how do we prevent it from just exploding

01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,920
into like you know here's yet another

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,480
choice in a

01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,839
crowded field of choices um what's going

01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,839
to help sort of guide us in that

01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:40,159
direction

01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,199
uh definitely a complicated uh you know

01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,199
architectural question

01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,640
so maybe i'll maybe i'll i can constrain

01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,719
a little bit

01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,159
go ahead so some of the things that i

01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,759
talk about

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:58,560
um are things that i think are

01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,080
probably pretty easy they're they're

01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,319
prosthetics

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,839
you know they're um they're not so much

01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,040
about things like interchange

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:08,799
between what's happening on this

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,520
platform and what's happening outside

01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:12,319
so for instance when i when i talk about

01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,400
um

01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,960
things to help people ghostwrite

01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,880
each other's comment replies right and

01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,600
save and show their saved replies and

01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,159
things like that

01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,960
that's that's pretty on platform right

01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:27,679
um

01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,080
and then there's stuff that is much more

01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,520
about

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,839
interaction and uh and tooling

01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,520
um you know that somehow might have some

01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,480
kind of api integration with with some

01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,480
other thing like

01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,520
slack and discord and stack overflow and

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,080
stuff like that

01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:44,080
um i think that

01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,719
the issue of um well we don't want to

01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,759
monocle but how do we not like fragment

01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,600
too much

01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:59,600
um i just i don't see when i look at

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,120
just the marketplace dynamics

01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,960
of the industry it doesn't feel like

01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,000
that's going to be too much of a problem

01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,280
because

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,960
um the there just aren't

01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:16,080
that many different user types

01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,600
there's maybe 10 let's say uh different

01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,719
user types of

01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,080
different specific shapes of open source

01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,440
software projects

01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,239
and what kinds of like governance

01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,800
structure

01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,400
and participation structure and and

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,520
prosthetics they need

01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:35,520
um i would go by for instance the um

01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,640
uh the open tech strategies archetypes

01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,440
report here

01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,480
and say all right there's there's just

01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,040
not that many

01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,800
diff very different and probably you

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,040
could find

01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,320
something like five like supersets of

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,640
that and have

01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,159
all right this and much like you know

01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,080
people use

01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,600
um different kinds of collaboration

01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,280
software for different

01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,600
sizes of organization and for optimizing

01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,520
for

01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,640
let's say you know egalitarianism versus

01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,159
hierarchy

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,679
so i think similarly something like um

01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,440
you know five different and as long as

01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,760
there are migration paths from one to

01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,120
the other

01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,640
people aren't generally going to find

01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,760
that migrating from fortune forge is

01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,840
something that they do

01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,520
on like a month to month basis but as

01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,440
long as there's migration paths so that

01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,520
you can say oh i've outgrown this

01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,800
like a hermit crab outgrowing its shell

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,440
and now i need to move on to the next

01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,920
one

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,520
um like going from like flask to django

01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,960
you know oh i need to have more complex

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,120
needs now i need to move over here

01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,320
uh that doesn't feel like too much of a

01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,840
problem again

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,840
i assume that this talk will be a

01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,400
laughingstock to people in the future

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,600
who look back and say like freeze frame

01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,840
this is where she said it wouldn't be a

01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,840
problem

01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,320
and the narrator it turned out to be a

01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,520
problem

01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,679
seriously um excellent uh

01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,560
simona thank you so much for for coming

01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,159
