Title: Shaping the contributor experience - GitHub Universe 2019
Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: GitHub Universe 2019 - Open Source and the Community
Description: 
	Presented by Sara Cope, Engineer, and Courney Brousseau, Civic Digital Fellow, at Code.gov

At the end of the government shutdown, Sara found herself as the single developer responsible for more than 20 open source projects. To keep everything afloat, she needed help from the open source community. This talk will dive in to how to stay sane when youâ€™re a solo team member, conducting usability research on your open source projects and crafting an intentional contributor experience to grow your community.

00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:25,739
there we go

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,750
hi everyone we are from Co gov and today

00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,019
we're going to talk about shaping the

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,660
contributor experience I am Sarah cope -

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,150
lead engineer on code gov and I'm

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,309
Courtney I was a Civic digital fellow on

00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:44,070
the code dev team this summer so code

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,290
gov was created out of the federal

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,640
source code policy which was actually

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:55,140
released in August of 2016 now in that

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,229
policy it said that federal agencies had

00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,530
to open-source at least 20% of their

00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:04,619
code and so code gov was created in

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,909
order to house an inventory all that

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,939
code was that was being open sourced and

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:14,820
the point of this was to not only have a

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,220
place to share it but create a place

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,280
where folks can come and find that code

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,999
and reuse it and contribute to it what's

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,130
the ultimate goal of reducing

00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:30,810
duplicative efforts and saving money

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,319
across the u.s. so in November of that

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,889
same year in 2016 our former White House

00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:38,310
leader

00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:42,030
Alvin Slade he announced could gov right

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,039
here at github universe so I'm so very

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,109
excited to be back with you today in

00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,959
celebrating code Gove's third birthday

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:51,829
and talking with you about some of the

00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,829
things that we've been up to

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:59,159
now when code gov launched it did so

00:01:55,889 --> 00:02:02,130
with less than 50 repositories of

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,459
federal open source code and today we

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:10,319
have more than 6,000 which is incredible

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:13,950
and exciting I actually joined the code

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,520
gov team about a year ago at the end of

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,099
summer of 2018 and here we are this is

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,410
part of our team that we had a hackathon

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,720
event for George Washington University

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,600
students we actually did several

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,700
hackathons last year and we saw some

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,680
common themes coming out from those

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,340
events

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,860
we would always go through our project

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,470
repositories and provide those to people

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,260
so if they wanted to contribute to the

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,420
code gov platform they were able to we'd

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,129
introduce it to them we've set up some

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,349
issues and make sure there were

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,510
beginning beginner-friendly issues and

00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:57,439
ask folks to contribute but we did

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,840
notice some problems there so some of

00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,510
the problems that we had was in the code

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,319
gov platform we actually had a lot of

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,989
repos there were more than 20 available

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,840
not only for the platform itself but

00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,879
some of the tools we used and some of

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
the other products and documentation

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,950
that we created so there was a lot going

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,260
on in that ecosystem and as a result

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,629
folks who wanted to contribute to the

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,439
Kotov platform weren't really sure where

00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:30,409
to begin there was too much if they did

00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,910
find a Rito where they decided to

00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:37,310
contribute they didn't always get it up

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,560
and running depending on what operating

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:43,400
system they were using on their machine

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,159
if they were able to get the platform up

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,169
and running locally they sometimes

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,780
missed out on a few things that weren't

00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:53,540
clear so if they didn't request their

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,060
own API key or they didn't request the

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,810
design system you still weren't getting

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,930
the full platform experience we also

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,900
noticed when people did enter issues or

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,540
PO requests they weren't always doing

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,819
that on the correct repository because

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:16,459
again it wasn't really clear with

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:19,549
everything that we had going on now at

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,979
that same time last year we were working

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:25,699
on reap lat forming the site from

00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:28,880
angular to react and that was a big lift

00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:31,909
so we knew we had these contributor

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,490
experience problems but we didn't really

00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:36,550
have time to focus in on them at that

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,550
time

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,430
and then the following month in December

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,500
of last year

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,490
we're actually forced to stop working on

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:56,260
the platform this lasted for five weeks

00:04:51,490 --> 00:05:00,940
and end up being 10% of our work for the

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:03,520
year when a government shutdown happens

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,510
federal employees are not allowed to

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,610
work and it's really gray weather that

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,400
continues to open source repos or not

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,310
it's actually illegal for us to continue

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,140
working in a volunteer state so we

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,530
didn't make any progress on the platform

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:23,560
and when I did return to work I did so

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,990
on a smaller team the two other

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,840
engineers who are on the code gov team

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:32,500
had moved on during the government

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,560
shutdown so I went from being on an

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:40,450
engineering team to just being the

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,180
engineering team and while I was super

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,450
excited to be back to work at the end of

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,150
the government shutdown to say I was

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,160
absolutely panicked and terrified would

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:56,170
be a super understatement this is

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,480
literally me at one point I was also

00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,910
working on three other projects while

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,010
working on the code of platform I wasn't

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,250
on the project full-time and I was

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,870
actually new to react so I spent a lot

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,510
of the government shutdown just trying

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,560
to figure out react myself and so to

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:19,750
come back and be the only person was

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:22,570
horrific so I knew right off the bat

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,210
that I had to take a step back and

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:29,350
figure out what I needed to do to keep

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:33,310
it all together I really had to focus on

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,940
the small things and ask myself every

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,240
day what can I do today to create a

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:43,270
better tomorrow for myself and a lot of

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,830
times that just meant reading some more

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,600
documentation adding another test

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,730
automating some small tasks that make a

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,540
big difference in the long run

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,390
I also knew I needed to keep advocating

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,090
for more team members within the federal

00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:04,000
government it can be a super hard and

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,570
slow process to add members to the team

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,720
so I kept my voice up and be sure to ask

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,670
for more team members I also asked for

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,730
help not only from what's in our team

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,800
but from the other engineers within our

00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,770
organization we're lucky enough to have

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,190
a really great organization within TTS

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,380
of 18f and innovation teams so I was

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,700
able to tap into those folks and ask for

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:33,280
help and in the end I just had to

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,440
remember to give myself grace if the

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,660
platform burned down it'll be fine

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,460
because we're open source and we use

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,030
version control and everything's on

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,460
github so I knew if I published anything

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,780
that was bad we could just always roll

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:51,430
it back and that helped give me

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:54,700
confidence so these are some of the

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,250
reasons why we wanted to focus on

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,050
contributor experience so they had more

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,950
support and we could move forward with

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,560
the platform and I'm also super thankful

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,530
that code gov is an open source project

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,140
that anyone can contribute to because of

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,860
this the two stuff that staff that left

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,740
we're able to continue to chat with us

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,820
and add put requests and comment on

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:24,070
issues in their free time this allowed

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,040
us to create a more easy transition

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,080
between team members and because we have

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,570
an open community in slack they were

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,550
also able to continue to connect with

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:42,370
the community and keep the conversation

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:44,250
going so what do we do right away we put

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,510
a freeze on new feature development

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,850
because new features are great but if

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,770
you don't feel confident and trust your

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,310
platform you don't want to keep moving

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,920
forward at the same time we also knew

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,030
that we had to keep doing our security

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:04,050
updates so we are addressing any

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,050
vulnerabilities as they came along

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,730
tests became a much higher priority

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,950
adding more tests to more platforms

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,380
everywhere and adding those to

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,040
continuous integration to automate them

00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:24,160
and then we also kicked off our

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:25,720
contributor experience user research so

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,910
as Sarah mentioned the team decided to

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,380
do some user research to identify ways

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,839
that we could make our platform or

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,089
contributor friendly and so the team's

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,170
UX analyst Chrissie camara did some

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:40,149
amazing interviews and analysis of other

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,860
open-source projects to try and figure

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,480
out what were some of the best tips and

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,449
practices that we could follow with our

00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,279
own repos we wanted to do this both to

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,440
improve our own repos and to serve as a

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,320
model to the other 6,000 repos that are

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,910
on code gov that other agencies maintain

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,699
and that are looking for open source

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,800
contributors and we also looked at

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,870
things like github github best practices

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,760
and other like I said other open source

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,790
repos to see how we could make our repos

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,890
the best they could be so the team ended

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,019
up doing 14 total interviews with a

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,670
range of participants this included both

00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,310
people that had previously contributed

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,070
to code gov and also people who might

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,810
want to contribute in the future we went

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,149
through the process of creating email

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,910
templates and consent forms interview

00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,709
guides and research plans that we could

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,930
use to get really good insights from

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,640
these interviews and we ended up

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,940
recording them taking really copious

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,890
notes and condensing our findings into

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,480
lessons learned both for how we could do

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,430
user research better in the future and

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,860
for how we could improve the contributor

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,860
experience for the code gov platform

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,220
these are some of the tools that the

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,029
team used which we had at our disposal

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,519
luckily to keep notes to hangouts and

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,190
video chats and advertise our user

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,720
research to get participants some of the

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,610
things that the team learned that are

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,260
gonna be used going forward with future

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,850
research or we know that sometimes

00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,230
people don't have the ability to use

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,910
Google Hangouts or me for whatever

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,740
reason so we always have a backup ready

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,199
so that's not a last-minute barrier to

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,089
doing some research it's important to

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:14,890
set up some folders and templates and

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,899
documents beforehand so that it's easy

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,230
to keep everything organized as we go

00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,630
through the process

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,610
and finally it's important to book at

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,100
least 50 minutes with user researchers

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,150
research participants anything less just

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,100
doesn't get your really valuable

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:32,540
insights an in terms of how we could

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,980
improve the contributor experience there

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,930
are four major barriers that we

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,180
identified that discourage people from

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,130
contributing to our projects or to open

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,430
source project in general that we wanted

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,890
to work on addressing so one of them was

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,060
if people found a project that hadn't

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,860
been participate or hadn't been

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,360
contributed to or changed in a long time

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,800
they really weren't interested in

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,570
contributing they weren't sure if their

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,730
contribution was going to be accepted if

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,800
it was going to be helpful at all and so

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,230
they were definitely discourage them

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,630
from participating we knew we had some

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,370
code gov repos that were old or archived

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,530
that we need to make sure we're clear

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,310
that they weren't active projects that

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,440
we needed help with the second thing is

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,470
we really needed to focus on good

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,170
documentation it's a really important

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,940
but you know frequently overlooked part

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,830
of having a high-quality open source

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,260
project that's easy to contribute to and

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,790
with our project specifically with so

00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,920
many different repos that contribute to

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,480
one platform having clear documentation

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,050
about how they all connect is really

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,300
important we also found that people

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,470
really valued a code of conduct not just

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,090
one that was there but one that was

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,710
enforced so we thought a little bit

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,880
about how to address that concern and

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,350
finally people were much more likely to

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,200
contribute to a project when they were

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,670
other participants contributing they

00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,110
felt like that was a signal that the

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,460
project was welcoming to outside

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,620
contributors and that their

00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,020
contributions would be you know seen

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:04,250
valued merged and actually put into

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:06,560
production if possible so thinking about

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,580
those barriers to contribution we

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,900
decided to focus in on four major areas

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,400
to tackle and I'm gonna go suit through

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,890
some of those today but we actually

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,620
ended up with a whole spreadsheet of

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,110
items so if anyone wants that later we

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,890
can connect and you can share it the

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,600
first area that we focused in on was

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,640
documentation we saw a huge issue with

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,310
documentation on our project

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,560
right off the bat we decided to set a

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:39,670
minimum level of documents that we were

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,070
going to create and include on each repo

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,930
that way folks who are coming recognized

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,430
immediately that this is a code dog or a

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,529
repo they knew where to get the

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,040
documents they were looking for and it

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:54,740
established some consistency we then

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,279
took the same starter documents and

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:01,130
created a repo template in github so

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,720
that for any future repos that we create

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:11,209
we're getting that same set of documents

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:14,420
we also took the time to redo all of our

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,490
tags across all of our repos so if you

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,070
went to one of our repos it would have

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,079
different tags labels than one of the

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,180
other repos which again was super

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,420
confusing to people and it didn't really

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:30,529
help us stay organized so we used an

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:33,320
automated tool to create a standard JSON

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:38,680
file of tags and upload those across the

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:41,720
VAR repos we also spent a lot of time

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,750
incrementally just making updates to the

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,079
documentation and re looking at that

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,199
with users so that it made more sense

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,839
how all the pieces of the platform work

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,850
together and where you needed to go to

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:02,750
do what we also took a look at

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,750
transparency so we added some badges for

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:08,750
testing and continuous integration to

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,850
our platforms things like circle CI and

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,470
just one of the things that was

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,980
surprising to us in our research is

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:20,720
people really liked those badges we also

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,660
worked on our release notes and making

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,740
those more detailed and using those more

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:31,250
often and publishing those not only on

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,310
github but to our listserv into our

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,680
slack so that people are more able more

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,040
easily able to see our updates in

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,160
different places we also have a product

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,569
roadmap publish to code gov so if you go

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,470
to the footer of our site you can click

00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,110
on our roadmap

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,820
and see what we're up to in addition to

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,610
that we've been putting more of an

00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,160
effort into publishing blog posts about

00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:01,100
the work that we're doing including this

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:03,560
work on user research we've also taken a

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,680
look at community engagement so we've

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,930
started explicitly thanking our

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,390
contributors and release notes we also

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,730
have published our mission and vision to

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:17,270
the home page of our site to help show

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,040
people what we're doing and why the work

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,850
we're doing is important to help them

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,680
create a connection we're working to

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,800
acknowledge issues and floor requests

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,650
within 24 hours even if we're not able

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,870
to work on those right away we want to

00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,090
make sure people know that we're active

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,060
we're seeing their contribution and we

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,920
appreciate it

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,860
we also continue to participate in

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,310
events and we're actually looking into

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:53,090
participating in google Summer of Code

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:56,090
sometime next year one of the last areas

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,460
of focus was user interaction so when

00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,810
people are coming to our repos what's

00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,400
the experience like what are the

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,290
interactions and touch points that

00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,329
they're having so I already talked about

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,670
updating tags and we also went through

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,730
and updated our issue and pour requests

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,949
templates as well that not only allows

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,110
the user to see immediately off the bat

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,800
the kind of thing we're looking for it

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:23,000
gives them a checklist and in a more

00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,490
consistent way we also added automated

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,410
testing to each repo to give us and the

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,650
contributors more confidence in the

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,650
platform we've also been working to

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:37,430
remove or archive and consolidate repos

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,580
that maybe aren't really needed or can

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:44,140
be consolidated together in order to

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,360
reduce the total platform footprint

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,480
we've also updated our code of conduct

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,810
and that has helped us get to Green on

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,780
github in the community engagement or

00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,470
interaction profile which people we

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,259
noticed also when they

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,600
trying to figure out what repos they

00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:05,340
want to look at the community profile is

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,769
something people definitely take a look

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:12,600
at and as I mentioned earlier I joined

00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:14,039
the team for this summer as a civic

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
digital fellow it's a really cool

00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,850
program that tries to bring college

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,190
students interested in mission driven

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,730
work into government as a product

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:26,190
manager a designer data scientist or a

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,509
software engineer and so as one of the

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,159
fellows this summer working with the

00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,720
code gov team I got to work on some of

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,370
the projects that Sarah was just talking

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,470
about they specifically worked on a

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,230
project around defining and tracking our

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,610
engagement metrics on github one thing

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,110
that Sarah and I talked about as soon as

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,389
I joined the team was that it was

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,460
difficult to track how many issues we

00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,210
had open how many contributors have been

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,009
in the past month

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,779
how many issues were stale or that we

00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,159
hadn't responded to because it was

00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,139
spread out across all of our different

00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,110
repos and so we had to manually look or

00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:56,399
collect that information and so Sarah

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:59,730
and I talked about how we could create

00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:01,919
or use some existing tool to track all

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,860
of those metrics across these various

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,450
repos because we are an open source

00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,830
project and we're promoting open source

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,360
and for the federal government I first

00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,850
looked to see if there was anything that

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,679
already existed that did this but I was

00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,929
unsuccessful in finding any open source

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,669
project that did what we needed so I

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,220
went about the process of creating a new

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:23,250
command-line interface which uses the

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,870
new graph QL github API to extract these

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,299
metrics from all of our different repos

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:30,210
and put them in one CSV file that we can

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:32,070
import into a Google spreadsheet like

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,450
all of our repos this repo is open

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,679
source and so if you want to use this

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,919
command line tool yourself it's

00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,269
available on our GSA github organization

00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,759
and you can feel free to contribute or

00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:45,000
fork it if you'd like but it really

00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,830
helps us visualize as a team how many

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,149
people are contributing how many issues

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,740
our sale all these different metrics

00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:51,240
that really help us understand if we're

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,870
improving the contributor experience

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,700
across our platform as a whole so here's

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,620
an example of one of the charts that

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,779
we've created based on this data that

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,639
helps us see ways in which we can

00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:04,320
improve our experience and there's a few

00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,990
things I want to highlight here that I

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,750
think really help showcase how important

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,200
this data is so one is that every time

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,630
that we are participating in a hackathon

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,790
whether that's something at GW or hack

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,130
tober fest or something else we see a

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,280
spike in external contributors which is

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:25,190
that yellow bar in each of the months

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,360
and so you know in those separate times

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,520
we can see that we get a lot more

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,720
contributions and that encourages us to

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,070
keep attending these events because I

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,950
think we think it helps grow our

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,480
contributor community the second thing

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,980
is that as Sarah previously mentioned

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,890
there was a government shutdown in

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,660
January December January and so you can

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,240
see the impact of that really clearly on

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,280
this graph internal contributors goes

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
basically to zero and we don't really

00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,190
see a lot of external contributors which

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,140
we think has to do with the fact that

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,730
people didn't want to contribute if I

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,860
knew their contribution wasn't going to

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,030
be seen merged soon and then finally we

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,830
can see that in the last few months

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,480
we've actually seen a lot of new

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,340
first-time contributors or more that we

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,660
didn't then we did in the past so we

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,490
want to continue to try and get that

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,410
green bar to be bigger have more

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,640
external first-time contributors and

00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,730
grow the amount of people that are

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,470
making coke of a great site to host all

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,470
of these other amazing open-source repos

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,880
so for all the work that we have done so

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:29,929
far we wanted to make sure that we were

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,570
retesting with users and making sure

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:35,600
those developers could more easily

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,490
contribute to our platform and we

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,890
weren't just doing all these changes for

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,740
fun so to follow up we're going to be

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,320
conducting monthly user interviews at a

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,390
small scale we've done one of those in

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,070
September this year already as an

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:52,610
experiment and we're going to continue

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,200
that in the new year for these user

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,620
interviews we're just going to be

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,870
testing three users on one day once a

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,820
month will be immediately debriefing and

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:08,120
gathering that information in a one

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,240
pager and then adding those issues to

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,710
our github repos into our backlog for

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:18,559
action the idea here is to clear out any

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,410
major blockers that we can identify with

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,059
our contributor experience and continue

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,059
to iterate and make it easier

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:32,340
so what's next for cocoa we're going to

00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:35,340
continue to publish our research and

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:37,770
findings on our blog we already have two

00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,140
blog posts up that specifically talked

00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:43,919
about this same information we'll be

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,890
sharing more in the future will be also

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,309
taking all the best practice practices

00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,809
and lessons that we've learned and

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,720
consolidating those into a federal open

00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:58,410
source playbook and toolkit to be

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,230
released early next year the goal of

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,809
that is to encourage other agencies and

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,890
other projects to follow these same best

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:10,980
practices and make sure that the 6000

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:13,830
repost we have on code gov also have a

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,809
really nice contributor experience so

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:22,740
that people are able to add to and

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:25,130
contribute to other federal code and at

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,440
the end of the day it's been really hard

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,990
working on a super important project

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,429
without a huge engineering team but I'm

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:37,290
so glad that code gov is an open-source

00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:40,230
project with a great open-source

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,450
community to help it move forward as a

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,120
team we'll continue to work on small

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,700
incremental changes every day because

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,740
that's what public service is about we

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,169
work in public service because we get

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,500
the chance to work hard at work worth

00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:57,809
doing so I want to thank those people

00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,390
who have walked along this journey with

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,390
me along the way and thank you today

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:13,040
I think we do have a couple minutes for

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:22,160
questions if anybody wants to come up

00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:27,400
and ask a question yeah you want to come

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,400
up and I'll repeat the question

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,650
so the question is how do we

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:54,410
differentiate the experience between

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:57,800
onboarding developers versus other folks

00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,690
who might be doing UX or UI okay so in

00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,640
our two rounds of you know testing they

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,790
weren't all focused on developers our

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,530
first round of testing was actually it

00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,080
did include a lot of tasks it was more

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,880
asking people questions what do you do

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,860
how do you contribute what things do you

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,070
look for what's important to you and

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,680
then the follow-on research user

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:22,550
research we did was more developer

00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,680
focused and in the September interviews

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,500
again we had to developers and one

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,560
person who wasn't a developer so we're

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,690
trying to not just like shoehorn

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,360
ourselves into the developer experience

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:39,080
and get feedback from other folks as

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,860
well as far as UX and UI we haven't

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,990
specifically focused on that area okay

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,700
and to add to that I just wanted to

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,080
mention as well that one of the things

00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,630
we thought about when I was creating the

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,940
tool that I mentioned was that you know

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,530
number of issues and number of PRS all

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,230
of those are kind of imperfect metrics

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:59,060
for determining you know how much

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,830
contribution how many contributions are

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,870
out of the project especially since it

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,090
doesn't track things like UI and UX

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,760
contributions or people that are helping

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,460
in other ways and so I think code gov

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,650
can always use help in those areas as

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,970
well and so it's something that I think

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,130
the team is probably thinking about in

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,510
terms of how to both encourage

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,010
contributions from people that aren't

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,300
strictly developers

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,430
and how to recognize those contributions

00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,500
and release notes and other ways so that

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,360
we can make the site better holistically

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,330
yeah and I've done a lot of work with

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,790
students through a local program and

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:35,000
folks with no developer experience so I

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:38,570
try to approach our repos with a very

00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,520
beginner mindset from the outside so if

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,740
you're really new to code if you don't

00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,870
even want to code there are still ways

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,290
that you can contribute and actually a

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,820
lot of the contributions we got through

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,860
October and October fest where

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,570
documentation issues where folks could

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,830
come in and make documentation updates

00:26:53,570 --> 00:27:01,400
for us any other we have a couple other

00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,080
questions okay hi my name is Garrett

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,170
link I'm with Patricia thank you very

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,750
much for sharing your insights on how to

00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:12,440
make projects more accessible to

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:14,780
contributors the question is whether you

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,530
are doing this for the repositories that

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:21,350
the GSA is responsible for or also for

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:24,380
all of the contributed code that is

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,960
contributed to that code

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,210
platform yeah all the other agencies

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,190
that have to produce open-source yeah

00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,770
that's a great question so our initial

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:36,740
goal was to improve the code gov

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,740
platform itself in all of the repos that

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,960
we are immediately in charge of and then

00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,450
to follow that on we're gonna work with

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,550
federal agencies to improve their repos

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,740
as well we wanted to start off with code

00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:51,320
gov so that we were sure we were setting

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,080
the example that we wanted to see in

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,060
other federal agencies so that's gonna

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,280
be the goal of the open-source playbook

00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,960
and toolkit for federal agencies that we

00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,550
are working on with other open-source

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,050
maintainer x' within the federal

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:09,050
government that will be launching early

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:10,520
next year sure hi I'm Susan from mind

00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,220
era software Kraft thank you for being

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,830
here I'm curious about your code of

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,130
conduct how that came about and what you

00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:22,490
did to enforce it and how that's going

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:24,980
so our original code of conduct was in

00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:27,620
place when I started but after doing

00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,530
some of our research we actually moved

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,419
to a more widely known code of conduct

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,369
the contributor covenant

00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:37,249
if you're familiar with that so now we

00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:39,139
have that honor repose and it allows

00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,970
people to come in and see right off the

00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:43,820
bat if they're more familiar with that

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,619
code of conduct it builds trust quicker

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,480
and more easily instead of having

00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:50,210
something that was more like government

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,419
speak that we had created ourselves we

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:56,059
also have internal processes to deal

00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:57,559
with issues as they can't come up but

00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,690
since I've been on the team in the past

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:05,149
year we haven't had any code of conduct

00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:07,309
issues reported thank you hi

00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:08,989
as a maintainer I feel your pain when

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:12,350
the rest of your team disappears and

00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:13,909
you're trying to fill that void and the

00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,440
magic of open source is that in theory

00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:17,239
we can have contributors come and

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,299
replace missing team members or augment

00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:21,649
our team did you find through any of

00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,179
your metrics that the work that you put

00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:26,059
into making it easier for people to

00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,590
contribute resulted in those

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:31,340
contributions being sort of a net

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,919
positive maybe Courtney can speak about

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:37,909
the metrics but I can speak clearly from

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,340
my observation from the user interviews

00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:42,590
that I did in September we interviewed

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,049
three users two of those were developers

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:47,239
and I asked both of them to pull down

00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:49,460
the platform and get it running locally

00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:51,470
on the machine with like no prompting or

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,940
extra help for me and they were both

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,340
able to do that within a couple minutes

00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,739
so for us I feel like that's a big win

00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,929
because before when we went to events we

00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:02,090
had to have an engineer on site kind of

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,009
leading people through here's the

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,769
platform here's where you need to go and

00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:08,539
now folks are able to actually pulled on

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,399
and get it running locally on their own

00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:14,029
without us like sitting over their

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,289
shoulders yeah right I'm just gonna say

00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,580
that's super excited to hear because

00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:18,950
Sarah and I spent a ton of time this

00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,149
summer updating documentation so I'm

00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,220
really glad to hear that that's working

00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,720
from a metrics perspective I haven't

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,330
seen the most recent metric since I'm no

00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,129
longer on the team but I think it's

00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,239
hopefully valuable now for the team

00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:33,470
internally to be able to use those

00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:35,600
charts to determine if changes are

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,919
making an impact in terms of the number

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,200
of first-time contributors and things

00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,389
like that that we can use there's also

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,239
kind of like SLA metrics for the team

00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:45,720
like I was saying for you know response

00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:47,850
time to

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,130
an issuer PR I think was one of the

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,560
metrics or how many issues are like more

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,800
than 120 days old so it's also kind of a

00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,180
check on the team to make sure that

00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,790
issues are being addressed PRS are being

00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,010
reviewed and that hopefully helps create

00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:05,520
better trust with our existing and

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:07,980
future contributors and if anyone at all

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,930
is interested in all the documentation

00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,870
that we created all the documents

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:15,870
research findings spreadsheets you can

00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:21,330
email us at code at GSA gov and we can

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:22,930
share that as well yeah all right thank

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,930
you thank you so much

00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:57,219
[Applause]

00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:57,219
