know participating fully in what's

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,770

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,810
improve what's happening in the

00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,570
environment and then we'd like to also

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:35,360
include you all in the discussion we'd

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,600
like to hear ideas from you all about

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,690
what we can do to change the environment

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,880
what we can do to support women in open

00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:51,350
source and make this a really successful

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:55,010
world okay so let me introduce myself

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,410
I'm Nadia ruff I have two roles

00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,650
I had the open source program office at

00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:04,640
Comcast and I also worked with the tech

00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:07,400
woman group in a Comcast we really

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,580
focused on making sure that we have a

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,890
diverse group of developers working to

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,680
create products and services for our

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,590
customers and really transform their

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,370
experience because really our customers

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,190
are men and women in the world and then

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,290
the other role I play I sit on the board

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,709
of the Linux Foundation I

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,140
chair the board and my role there has

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:36,829
been to really open doors to open source

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,069
to women and people of color and all

00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:42,709
kinds of diverse people into open source

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,140
so with that I'm gonna turn it over to

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,239
Veronica and then to the rest of the

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,370
panel to really talk about their stories

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,310
and introduce themselves and and their

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,590
organizations great thank you so much

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,680
hello everyone my name is Veronica young

00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,739
I am the brigade program manager for the

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,379
western region at Code for America

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,930
so Code for America is a tech non-profit

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,790
and we work in order to make government

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,889
more accessible to people through

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,379
technology particularly in the social

00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:15,019
safety net so our focus areas are in

00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:18,019
criminal justice food security and

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,840
workforce development my particular role

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,900
is working with our volunteer network so

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,120
there are 85 volunteer chapters across

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,340
the country which we call brigades and

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,769
they work in their local communities to

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,250
partner with local government as well as

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,979
local organizations to create projects

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,590
or products that are helpful to address

00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:42,919
issues in their community and these

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,599
projects mirror the areas in which Code

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,000
for America worked so there's a lot of

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,579
work in workforce development and

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,220
criminal justice and food security but

00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:55,609
also in housing security disaster relief

00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:00,349
and transportation are a few of the

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:02,299
other popular topic areas my skills are

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:05,239
really in community organizing so I'm

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:08,000
not a developer or technical person by

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,949
trade I come from the world of politics

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,889
where I worked in campaigns and

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:15,169
elections and now I'm able to use those

00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:18,250
community organizing skills for our

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,250
Brigade program

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:27,719
hi I'm Nikki Mustafa our here in the

00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,060
capacity of founder and CEO of how Anoop

00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:33,389
which is a nonprofit organization based

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,789
in Berlin Germany that I started three

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:39,900
and a half years ago to get more women

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:42,620
into programming my focus at the time

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:47,509
which was just about the height of the

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,879
refugee crisis in Europe was to get more

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:54,509
immigrants with refugee status and

00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,110
without as well as resident women in

00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:59,490
Germany to enter the tech industry

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:04,169
because I had been at the time working

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:09,379
for 16 15 16 years as a digitalization

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:12,360
program manager so I'm still working as

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:16,289
digitalization program manager in the

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,870
insure tech field now and as the CEO of

00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:21,719
Kanu what I've kind of focused on is

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,099
really the commonalities between women

00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,479
who are coming from different countries

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:27,419
women who are coming from different

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,969
backgrounds and women who are trying to

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,740
kind of shift their careers towards more

00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:34,319
technical subjects so that they can get

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,719
into this tech industry and have a say

00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,210
in the ways that software is being

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:44,159
developed and the future is going to

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:46,259
look hello my name is Kay I love it I'm

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:48,509
one of those women that natima helped to

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,289
people to thank my background was in

00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:56,190
journalism in the humanities now I work

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:58,199
as a data analyst / engineer and I'm

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,839
originally from Manila Philippines but

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,139
now I live in Berlin Germany which is a

00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:07,770
whole new animal in terms of navigating

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,000
the tech environment yeah

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,980
thank you hello everyone my name is

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,920
Olivia varaha and I'm chief operations

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,970
officer for code for Romania just as my

00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,410
colleague here from Code for America

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:23,110
where we're a civic tech NGO in based in

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,630
Bucharest and we have a community of

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,910
almost 1,000 people all across the world

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,310
mostly Romanians we're developing

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,010
software pro-bono to solve social issues

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,870
from healthcare to education and

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:39,040
domestic violence and all kind of other

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:41,710
areas of interest and I really hope to

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,690
manage to give you a bit of a picture of

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,840
what it is in Eastern Europe for women

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,560
in technology today thank you thank you

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,400
ladies why is it important for us to

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:58,300
discuss this today number of reasons one

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,810
we have a severe shortage in developers

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,490
across the world you know especially as

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,970
companies become more and more software

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,620
companies I mean I can speak to us as an

00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:15,340
enterprise as we move towards software

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,160
we find that we are really searching and

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,890
competing with every other company in

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,440
the world for good talent so that's

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,040
that's one big reason the second big

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,370
reason is studies have proven again and

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,700
again that as we move to a more digital

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,400
world we need to have creators of the

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,720
technology who are also diverse and who

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,330
can reduce the bias in the systems and

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,790
frankly the third is one of the best

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,770
paths for economic empowerment and

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:53,470
economic freedom for people is tech and

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,660
tech really changes people's lives and

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,720
we want you know everybody to

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,150
participate in that change and benefit

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,330
from that change so you've heard a lot

00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,610
of the stories of how these

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,960
ladies started these organizations so

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,700
I'm going to go talk to you all about

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,880
you know you mentioned briefly Veronica

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,470
the problems that you're trying to solve

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:21,990
how do they use open-source and are they

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:26,520
creating projects that help with these

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:29,250
different areas like food hunger or you

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,230
know housing shortages and things of

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,360
that nature can you describe some of the

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:38,540
projects that that are being worked on

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,670
sure so yes our communities use github

00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,640
specifically in order to create their

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:46,440
products across the country and so

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,630
open-source is really the foundation of

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,210
the work that we do and is incredibly

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,820
important especially in we are a

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,090
non-profit and the work that volunteers

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,950
are doing are in a volunteer capacity so

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,560
folks aren't essentially getting paid

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,160
for their work so being able to create

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,370
on an open-source platform really gives

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,280
the ability for us to do great work in

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,220
our communities that is not tied to any

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,610
monetary type of benefit but it also

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,060
helps them build their resumes and then

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,890
they can use that to go on to other jobs

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,690
yeah I think that's particularly

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,630
important especially when we're talking

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,970
about women and open source is that open

00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,920
source allows people from not

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,510
necessarily traditional backgrounds to

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,360
be able to build their skills and work

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,700
on projects that you can then use on

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,620
your resume when you're either breaking

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,860
into the field or continuing your growth

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,470
with an attack technical field so being

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,380
able to build on open source and create

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,210
essentially a resume is a really

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,390
important tool and anything particularly

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,180
an empowering tool for women to be able

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,860
to continue to break into an industry

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,710
that hasn't necessarily been from

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,000
to us

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:08,120
and nickimja I particularly love what

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,930
you're doing with brown loop frown loop

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,040
means women's loop right and I just I

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,580
just figured it out

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,680
just now after talking to you all but

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,480
there are some unique challenges you all

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,330
face in Berlin and in Europe as it

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,670
pertains to helping women from

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,470
non-traditional backgrounds enter tech

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,459
can you describe some of those

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,920
challenges and how you're helping you

00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:39,529
know these women overcome some of those

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,649
challenges sure I think some of the

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:44,510
biggest challenges that we face are that

00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:46,750
we're reaching out to a broad and a

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,760
diverse group of women with different

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,320
perspectives on what tech means everyone

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,890
understands that it's an economic

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,110
opportunity everyone understands that

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,029
there are long term career perspectives

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,190
that may change depending on where you

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:05,120
specialize that's one of the things our

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,339
program is pretty good at exposing the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,870
students to is you know you don't have

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,670
to go into one direction or another

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,040
you're really supposed to over the

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,339
course of you know successive cycles

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,380
typically three twelve week cycles to

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,100
get a perspective on whether you're more

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,900
interested in front and back in data

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,810
machine learning where you feel like you

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:30,250
fit and how you would most like to

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:33,200
contribute as a technical professional

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,980
the challenge has to do with your status

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,290
more often than not you know we train a

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,480
lot of women who are coming out of

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,130
maternity leave they are trying to get

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,160
out of whatever industry they're working

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,590
in there

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,210
we have filed for asylum they're waiting

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,400
for a decision and don't know how long

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,840
they'll be in the country they've

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,670
already been in the country for many

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,260
years and their credentials are not

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,060
accepted so they have to work in

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,130
something under the level that they

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,020
would like to be at and for all of these

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,850
women you know that the end goal is

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,640
really where they start off you know how

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,620
am I going to get a job what is the

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,750
stability of that job what's the

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,430
likelihood that my credentials in a

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,880
non-traditional program like POW and

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,680
knew going to be accepted by not you

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,450
know larger more established German

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,750
companies necessarily but by startups

00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:25,540
you know so younger people much like

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,580
myself who may or may not be familiar

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,040
with this program how am I going to

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,110
build up my professional resume over the

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,660
course of a non-traditional program in a

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:39,490
way that I feel confident that I'm going

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,640
to get into a permanent job you also

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,180
mentioned that sometimes open source

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,430
doesn't help

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,820
in fact people are looking at open

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,580
source suspiciously maybe cake and also

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,080
shed some light on that

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:57,430
just my experience of interviewing in

00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,280
Berlin for roles for engineering roles

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,990
that I already have answered their

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,660
questions their technical questions and

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,700
just to tell them okay by the way I also

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,180
called in Python and you can see my

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,680
stuff in github and they're like no we

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,840
don't actually believe that you know

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,480
people do that like you've worked on it

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,120
there's a bit of disbelief and pushback

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,870
on top of like the institutional

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,760
barriers that you face so you always

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,780
have to prove yourself over and over

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,750
again to different people so you know we

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,690
often kind of very smoothly talk about

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,640
github being the new resume right and

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,610
that you can actually look at the code

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,640
and you can look at people's work there

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,460
I was shocked when I heard the story

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,730
that you know it's looked at but

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,889
suspicion in some places

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,649
as oh you must have just cut and pasted

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:56,970
it it's not your work and and I think

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:59,370
that's shocking it's like I'm not from

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,680
that so how else am I gonna prove to

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,980
these people I'm like that I've done

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,870
this you know like there's it's not it's

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,820
in in in an interview process there's

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,190
not much opportunity to do that unless

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,660
you know somebody who knows somebody who

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:15,269
will introduce you and who will vouch

00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,610
for you if you're an immigrant and you

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:18,810
don't have those connections then that's

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,209
the only way to do it

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,089
you guys are pointing out all of the

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,500
obstacles that are there for women who

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:28,320
come from non-traditional backgrounds

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,540
whether it's because of their status or

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,389
because of their past you know

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,019
background in another field and entering

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:39,180
tech and and I'd be will come back and

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,639
revisit this which is some of the

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,019
wonderful things that Froy loop is doing

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,019
to remove some of those barriers

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,300
after you Olivia Olivia what is

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,920
happening in Romania how are you helping

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,600
women get into tact

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,740
how are you enabling them to succeed so

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,410
there's a bit of a different situation

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,170
as we are currently open source in

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,910
Romania is quite quite a new phenomenon

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,819
that we're just starting to talk about

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,829
and what this can do to your resume to

00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,899
build up your career and start getting

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,819
into tech jobs and being a woman or just

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:18,870
a regular student coming out of college

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:20,970
and what we've seen is that we have a

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,740
lot of beginners coming in and starting

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,990
to do work like small tasks and github

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,300
we have a very streamlined process of

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,199
breaking down thoughts in six to seven

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,730
eight projects and different

00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,700
technologies for everybody to start

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,930
working on on various

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:39,000
development tasks and at that point we

00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,830
realized that what we can do as an NGO

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,210
who is not biased is not coming from

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,090
various companies and so on

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,470
we're a very we're community that's

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,090
being like at the middle between

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,040
government between companies between

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,990
regular citizens what we're doing is

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,540
that we're about you for these people so

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,340
it is really often that we get companies

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,290
asking us we have these people coming to

00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,880
interview for a job and we've noticed

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,590
they've been volunteering so their

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,630
experiences six months or one year in

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,250
code for Romania are these people for

00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,290
real are these people actually doing a

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,970
very good job at whatever they they've

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,170
been contributing within code for a man

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,760
but we're actually doing this

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,050
we're putting out paper we're putting

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,670
our recommendations and it's really

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,290
different when it comes you have a

00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,080
community of senior developers because

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,220
code for Romania is made generally

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,140
ninety percent are senior developers

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,510
currently in the organization you have

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,370
all these people with 10 15 20 years of

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,530
experience saying yes hire these people

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,990
they're doing a great job so we're

00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:33,240
trying to at some point in time we're

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,720
also gone out with content as much as we

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,010
could we I think in 2017 51 percent of

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,840
our community was made of women

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,880
obviously we don't just have developers

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,800
we have also UX CY designers and

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,910
communication people but to us it was

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
really important to get out with this

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,530
piece of information and we've been

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,990
learning we're in a culture where we

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,490
don't necessarily have oh my god how

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,840
many women we're not really discussing

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,670
about it because we have bigger issues

00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,110
to tackle and usually Dino come on we

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,420
have property we have other things we

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,740
don't need to talk about this but we

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,030
really do need to talk about this we

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,530
need to have code of conducts and our

00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,690
companies and our organisations we need

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,390
to talk about how we address and be more

00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,209
careful in general with

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:16,279
wellis approach I think I'm having a bit

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:19,579
of an issue with my microphone yeah I'm

00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:26,029
sure the mic gods at the back will help

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:29,090
us with with correcting these issues I I

00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:32,230
know that there are challenges both to

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,630
attracting women into this field and

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:38,179
having them accepted you know in in

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,600
organizations but you guys are doing

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:43,580
some really interesting work in doing

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,010
you know dealing with some of those

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,600
challenges so what are some of the

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,380
challenges and how are you dealing with

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,870
it Veronica and then akima I would love

00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,750
to hear how you're doing that and then

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,710
how do you retain women in tech because

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,470
the environment sometimes do not support

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:07,789
you know diverse people being in in

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:10,700
technology yeah that's a great question

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:13,610
so we're fortunate at Code for America

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,850
our organization itself is very women

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,100
LED and actually majority women which i

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,769
think is a great standard for the work

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,490
that we're trying to do and hoping to be

00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:28,549
a model within the tech industry in our

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,889
diversity of both gender and racial

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:33,139
makeup given that the work that we do

00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:35,360
disproportionately affects people of

00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:37,370
color because of our systems and the way

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,309
that they've worked for the last few

00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,909
hundred years so that's definitely a

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:46,880
place of importance for us we recently

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:49,370
did a census to see where our network

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,820
was so we have about 20,000 people that

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,710
show up to Brigade work annually and we

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,320
wanted to see who it was that was

00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:01,070
showing up and those numbers reflected

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,289
the the tech industry so we weigh

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,809
heavily skew towards male participants

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,630
but one kind of shining light is that

00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,159
when it comes to leadership positions

00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:13,210
particularly are now

00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:15,909
on leadership we have a disproportionate

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,869
representation of women so I think it's

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:22,749
a continuing area of work and something

00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:24,840
that we are prioritizing in terms of

00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:29,590
making goals and strategies around

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:32,729
making sure that we reflect diversity in

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:36,369
gender in all levels of participation

00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:39,249
with our organization do people actually

00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:42,820
stay long-term with Code for America or

00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:45,340
do they use that as a building block to

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,859
go on to something else yeah it depends

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,739
so there are definitely different types

00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:53,049
of kind of volunteers and how long they

00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:55,059
say some people might come for one night

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:57,519
one half night some people might stay on

00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:59,259
for a project and then we have people

00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,779
that have been in the network for the

00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:04,720
last seven eight years since we

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,239
essentially started so there is a big

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,679
range of folks one question that you

00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:14,440
asked in terms of how do we retain women

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,299
in our communities and I think Olivia

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,789
spoke to this in terms of having a code

00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:21,070
of conduct that's something that we have

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:23,619
enforced since the very beginning and we

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,320
have very tangible ways to enforce the

00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:29,080
code of conduct and so I think that as

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,470
people feel safe to show up to these

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,440
spaces as themselves and behavior that

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:39,340
would make one not want to show up is

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,309
discouraged and eliminated from the

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:46,239
community then it makes a safe space for

00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,950
people to be a part if I may add just

00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:49,659
one more thing it's also important to

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,039
note is that both of the work we're

00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,889
doing in Code for America and good for

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,419
Romania is nonprofit work yeah so it's a

00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,950
very different motivation when you're

00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:58,629
coming in you're not coming in for a

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,129
paycheck you're not coming in to prove

00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:01,310
you're better than your colleague and

00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,680
deserve a promotion

00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,930
it's a way more it's the way motion

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,990
lifting and it's mission driven and not

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,790
necessarily getting a better outcome

00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,920
than the other one next to you so it's

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,330
really important to them to have more

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,600
places like this all over the world

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,520
right right nickimja

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,160
I mean you face a very different

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,110
challenge right I mean it's but we're

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,980
using the same a lot of the same

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:30,050
techniques I would say that as I as I

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,060
mentioned you know the focus for phone

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,030
hoop was always jobs full-time jobs

00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,760
economic inclusion so in order to get

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:41,000
there and based on just my observations

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,940
of what I saw lacking you know I come

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,130
from the US and the u.s. national where

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,870
I noticed that there was always a lack

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,800
of diversity in terms of ethnicity and

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:55,130
background got to Berlin and you know

00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:57,170
the gender disparity was shocking so I

00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,260
said listen if I'm going to create the

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,280
kind of environment that I want to

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,400
experience instead of what I do

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,550
experience day-to-day and

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,500
you know day job I need to enlist women

00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,450
who are themselves a part of this system

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,880
and who want to change it and so that's

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:17,629
the reason why 80 percent you know this

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:20,690
cycle 90% of the instructors are women

00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:23,359
most of them immigrants many of them

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,879
with you know Middle Eastern or other

00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:29,019
backgrounds specifically to target and

00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:32,119
to reflect the audience that we want to

00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:33,649
to serve and you know we're all coming

00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,799
from our day jobs which look very

00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:39,739
different than our classes where you

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,769
know we are trying to model the kinds of

00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:48,290
behaviors the kinds of aspirations that

00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:51,050
are lacking still when you have

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,690
societal and other barriers that lead

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,880
women to feel that a they can't get in

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,460
they don't know anyone who can help them

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,660
to get in and navigate the career path

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,910
in tech

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,820
you know and really it's it's something

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,850
that in terms of how to attract and

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,830
retain women it's it's one thing to go

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,570
to a hackathon and see that there may be

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,840
some women who are instructing you it's

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:18,330
something very different to go every

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,000
week to a space where women are coming

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,580
from their tech jobs and saying you know

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,740
I was a journalist before becoming a

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,300
data engineer I was you know whatever I

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,330
was doing before becoming a back-end

00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,340
engineer and I'm doing that actively and

00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:35,250
I need you to stick with this because

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,140
you too can do this and you know I want

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,150
the company we all want the company and

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,360
we need you in this industry or else it

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,130
will never change that's a very very

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,530
powerful thing that you said which is

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,650
the importance of role models the

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,710
importance of seeing others succeed and

00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,630
and it tells you I too can do it

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:58,110
especially if someone looks like me and

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:01,620
they have done it then it gives me a lot

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:04,860
of hope that I can to do it has it also

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,200
created a support system for women who

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,970
are working to come back then teach

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,720
others but also to support each other

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:15,120
and say hey how can we do this I mean

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,950
you know I that you're not alone in

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,990
facing this that there are others who

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:23,790
are you know facing this as well so am i

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:27,690
working in the company of a hundred and

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:30,450
maybe I'm one of five people slash

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,990
consultants who code and maybe I'm one

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,600
maybe I'm the only woman

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,550
they don't know any code mostly in

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,140
Python so open search is very important

00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,910
to me and I've made friends in the

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,860
open-source community in Berlin and I

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:46,390
considered myself a community both

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:48,430
programmer so at work I mean I try to

00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,920
make my work visible at work so that

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:54,520
other people are encouraged and I try to

00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,940
be open about it I've also started like

00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,800
coaching with by babies yeah and it's

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,430
you know I try to give back to the

00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:07,000
community and I guess little things at

00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,790
the workplace because I know that if

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,250
there's like a Newport newbie and this

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,170
person is from a different country I try

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,870
to welcome them give them like tips on

00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,030
how the office works you know these

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:21,910
little things make life a bit easier for

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:25,750
them and if they're interested in what I

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:28,840
do I try to you know impart my knowledge

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:31,000
it's wet but I would also add that I

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,370
think you know open-source is one of

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,990
those things where at least in my

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:38,320
experience in three and a half years

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:41,230
with kanu usually no one has worked with

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,600
git no one is familiar with github they

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,760
go through this in their first

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,890
you know cycle of training with ha loop

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,200
and they understand it becomes mandatory

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,560
as soon as you understand how to use the

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,080
tools but the next step of do you want

00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,390
to look for a project that might be of

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,500
interest you want to check out whether

00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:04,570
or not first-timers only are one of the

00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,320
various projects that are open source

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,240
could be welcoming for you and could

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,190
cater to the kinds of skills that you

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,740
want to practice the barrier of fear

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,810
tends to come up again and what we found

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,490
with how nuke which is that lots of

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,250
technologies which you know we're

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,990
training women in not just web

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,130
development you know machine learning

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,380
deep learning

00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:30,440
caris neural networks all of these kinds

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,690
of things are so much easier to

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,820
get your head around when you have a

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,250
real human preferably a woman who's

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,510
telling you how it works and that you

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,400
don't have to worry you'll do something

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,800
wrong or break something or you know and

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,530
it's the same with open source it's very

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,490
difficult to join yes and open yes a

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:51,710
remote yes an accessible global

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,950
community if you don't have a human that

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,840
you can kind of follow in real time at

00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,700
least at the start so we started to

00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,860
bring in women who have experience in

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,090
just maintaining these projects and

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,590
dispersing the work documenting the

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,200
projects because this is probably the

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,390
most important thing so that it's very

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,370
very clear regardless of where you are

00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,040
sitting and how you're coming to the

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,960
project that you can add to this part of

00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,310
the repository or address this issue and

00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,340
not get in trouble so it's important to

00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:27,860
have role models code of conduct it's

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:30,470
important to document it's important to

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,260
have a person that you can reach out to

00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:36,020
to ask questions who's not going to

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,320
shame you and say why are you asking

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,420
these questions you must be dumb or you

00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,250
know you should know this already right

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:48,260
and and we do that all the time

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:50,600
sometimes in tech and so it's important

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,480
to create that safe environment where

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,210
people can actually learn and not feel

00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,470
fright frightened of you know how

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,420
they're going to be judged or treated I

00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,980
know you guys are doing some amazing

00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:09,060
things Olivia

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:11,100
code for Romania where you're validating

00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,170
you know the work that people are doing

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,690
and these people are contributing to

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,510
some really mission-critical projects

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,130
can you describe some of the actions

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:24,150
you're taking to make it safe and

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:26,070
successful for women to enter first of

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,890
all I think we were one of the first

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,780
organizations in Romania that really

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,280
made a big deal out of the code of

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,140
conduct and putting it on the website

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,480
and having everybody sign it and approve

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,160
it once they joined us a volunteer so

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,720
everybody was looking at us and what's

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,100
with all the paperwork what is this

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,630
about I mean it's really important for

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,130
us to understand you're in a place where

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,410
you need to be respectful and helpful

00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,740
with your community but then we've set

00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,660
up a safe space email address and direct

00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,210
contacts for people to actually address

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,470
any kind of issues they might have in

00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,810
within our events and in the community

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,270
what we're also doing is that we

00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,400
encourage everybody to join our monthly

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,650
events exactly as you were saying it's

00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,180
really important to have a human contact

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,890
with somebody that's guiding you through

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:12,660
the process we never really tried to do

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,910
learning and teaching people to code at

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,290
our events because we had a huge mass of

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,910
senior developers coming in in the

00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,740
beginning but now that we've opened the

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,210
events for everybody we've noticed a lot

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,340
of juniors and people who are trying to

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,530
change their career paths actually one

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,320
of my my favorite volunteers if I can

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,450
say that is a lady she's 50 years old

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,390
and she started learning Python at code

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,650
for remain a coding events right now and

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,480
what we're doing is that we're

00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,000
encouraging we're trying to put up the

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,590
the girls in our core tech team always

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,270
on display always talking at these

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,970
events coordinating them running them

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,130
leading project and we're trying also to

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,350
make sure that all of our media

00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,910
appearances are balanced if we're gonna

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,530
have an interview and they want to talk

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,790
with three or four of us we're going to

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,040
make

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,510
there's always women and there's there

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,560
going to be first represented in the art

00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,420
people and they're gonna tackle these

00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,980
issues we're always trying to correct

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,960
like how we're presented in the media

00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,550
we're not just the guys from the

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,020
endocytic group that are doing some

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,030
techno we're not the guys were the

00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,070
people who are doing social change and

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,440
in terms of businesses the reason why

00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,790
they started trusting us when we say we

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,650
recommend these people and these women

00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,470
for you can hire them and they're going

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,880
to be good professionals is that when

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,710
you're a beginner and you're starting to

00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,420
work on something and github and you're

00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,520
on your own and you're doing probably a

00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,440
good job but it's a very small project

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,270
with their little impact you can go

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,890
after one year in code for Romania with

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,140
a project worked for I know the

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,150
Department of Emergency Situations or a

00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,770
project for a Ministry of Foreign

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,750
Affairs and stuff like that so it's

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,610
really important that they go in with a

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,140
resume that says okay you're working

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,030
with really big clients and if these

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,920
people are vouching for you then there

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,680
must be something good going on there

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,390
and these are just initial steps we're

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,760
trying to be very careful in how we

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,860
address all these issues but you know

00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,480
baby steps one step at a time we just

00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,560
gotta get people talking and I think one

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,770
of the most important things in our

00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,970
community is that we're also trying to

00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,770
whenever their sponsorship coming

00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,390
towards us and whenever we have a new

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,700
partner showing up we're trying to make

00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,600
sure that they also check all our points

00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,060
so we're not going to be

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,560
we're not going to engage with a company

00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,060
that doesn't respect all these things

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,550
and doesn't actually make visible

00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,370
efforts to be inclusive and take care of

00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,380
all these things even if it's really

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,060
difficult for us and we refuse funding

00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,530
but it's really important to have all

00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,030
those norms checked by all the companies

00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,830
that are coming in contact with code for

00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,260
me absolutely absolutely

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,300
what would you say what one thing would

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,750
you say to this audience and how they

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,410
can support the work that you're doing

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:42,750
and what one thing that they can do to

00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,690
change the environment I know it's a

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,600
tall order but how can they support you

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,660
and how can they support the environment

00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,330
for women to be successful sure and so

00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,580
particularly for Code for America we

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,820
would love everybody to participate in

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,060
our volunteer chapters as I said we have

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,980
85 across the country so the hope is is

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:09,060
that where you are there's a chapter

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,610
that's close to you also we obviously

00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,500
have opportunities for donations and to

00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,840
follow the work that we're doing we have

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,550
a monthly newsletter that we produce so

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,410
even just kind of staying on top of some

00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,930
of the work that we're doing is really

00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,180
helpful in terms of maintaining an

00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,400
inclusive environment and I think just

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,090
kind of living the values that you would

00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,340
like to see so obviously if you are part

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:35,970
of an underrepresented group and tackier

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,520
presence itself is is something is doing

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:42,600
good in terms of moving the the dialogue

00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,060
and the reality forward but also making

00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,070
sure that you are representing the

00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,380
values that you would like to see so if

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,690
you don't necessarily identify with an

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,730
underrepresented group in tech making

00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,550
sure that the spaces that you're a part

00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:00,150
of are formalizing ways like a code of

00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:02,760
conduct or really pushing diversity

00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:05,940
issues within your company or within

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,860
your organization to make it a more

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:13,700
inclusive and representative space

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:16,370
thank you I would say just to add to

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,190
that you know we're based in Berlin

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:22,010
Germany so it's not so easy to support

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:24,160
us directly but you know the

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,430
documentation that you provide for your

00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,830
open-source projects and fto

00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:33,070
first-timers only you know tag be issues

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,750
that you know newbie you can kind of

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,490
consistently look for and feel more

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,290
confident about contributing to because

00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:41,320
it makes a huge difference if you're

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:44,030
being pushed from you know the phone oof

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,650
mentors to find an open-source project

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,810
and go out and just you know be brave

00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,670
and you're like I'm not brave I'm

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,010
looking for her you know roadmaps and

00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:54,050
those are really good signs to indicate

00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:58,460
where your contributions will be

00:33:54,050 --> 00:34:00,980
welcomed and appreciated can-can is it

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,290
helpful also if a project has tagged a

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,060
mentor or said that there's a mentor

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:08,330
that can be reached in this project

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,190
there's always always helpful helpful to

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,590
have mentors who are volunteering to

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,530
look at your your code and give you

00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,090
feedback but it's definitely just very

00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,480
hard to navigate if you're on your own

00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:23,360
and most times you know newbies

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,310
relatively junior coders are working on

00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,580
this at home in their own hours and so

00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,380
they have to figure out who you are

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,020
speaking to when you're putting out a

00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,610
call for contributions and if they don't

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,830
feel like the language is necessarily

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:40,040
speaking to them it goes a long way to

00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,530
see a tag or a mention that you know you

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,630
can you can be brave and contribute and

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,880
someone will look at

00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,100
someone will get back to you can can

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,140
people financially support frown loop as

00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,180
well they can they are a nonprofit

00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,180
organization based in Germany we also

00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:58,660
have a 501 3 C that's a non profit

00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:01,960
registered in the US so always welcome

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:04,870
wonderful what do you think a what what

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,990
else can the audience do to make the

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:10,480
world a better place maybe this is

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,420
mostly for bosses having managers

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,700
value your employees work because a lot

00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,980
of us we work in open code and we'd love

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,430
to contribute but if it's if there's no

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,040
incentive for us because you know our

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,460
work are not recognized at work then

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,320
it's hard harder for us to join the

00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,580
community and contribute I mean Nakamura

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,700
and I were talking about it yesterday

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,580
and I was telling her I'm using this on

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:40,030
library but and I want to contribute but

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:42,450
you know like at work my job my data

00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:46,420
engineering job is not actually

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,040
formalize so like how am I you know I

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,720
would love to do it but I don't really

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,080
they don't they're not giving me enough

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,390
space and time to do this so if you're a

00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,970
boss or hiring manager and you see your

00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:02,500
employee doing something with open

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:05,320
source please support them yes and we've

00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,910
got about formed 4.5 minutes very

00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,950
quickly what do you think that the

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,500
audience can do and then I'll throw it

00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,180
open to the audience well for starters I

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,280
think everybody should be just to pay

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,500
more attention especially if your github

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,420
maintainer z' and if you're you have

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,280
your own personal project on github and

00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,630
you're looking for contributors just

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,190
make sure you have everything very well

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,670
documented it's really hard for somebody

00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,950
that doesn't really know your protocols

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,330
and he's joining and he's just looking

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,680
there and what am I gonna do now where

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:35,110
am I gonna start what I need to install

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,660
and so on and so forth and also think of

00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:40,090
the fact that it's not there's also a

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,570
very small community of non developers

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,370
were github they're usually the QAS and

00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,810
they're Kay's are developed but they're

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,310
usually the UX designers and UI

00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,840
designers who are also trying to

00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,550
contribute and want to join and want to

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,830
contribute to open source and you should

00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,510
also pay attention to those as well and

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,030
it's really important and also if you

00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,620
have initiatives in your hometowns or in

00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,780
your countries if you have initiatives

00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,020
that go and start talking to women like

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,550
in general school and high school try to

00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:09,070
fund them and support them as much as

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,930
possible because that is the moment when

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:12,940
women can actually decide they want to

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,860
go into a technical career but because

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,780
they don't really understand what does

00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,190
it mean can I only be a developer or

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,290
maybe I can have other jobs rather

00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,640
preoccupations in the tech world it's

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,470
really important for them to understand

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,570
from other role models at that point in

00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:27,430
time not when they've joined I don't

00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,730
know a college that they don't really

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,920
necessarily like or or are meant for so

00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,290
try to invest in those NGOs that do this

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,230
kind of work of counseling young women

00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,210
in going into technology thank you any

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,720
any questions from the audience or any

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:50,739
other ideas that you've seen that work

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,739
[Music]

00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:55,470
feedback right

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,560
Oh microphone

00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,560
[Music]

00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:07,749
okay any any other ideas or questions

00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:07,749
from the audience

00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,190
[Music]

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,320
I'll stay exactly seen and heard so I

00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,450
had a question for Veronica

00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,240
so you mentioned the code of conduct and

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:27,390
having offline or at least concrete ways

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,460
for enforcing or kind of supporting the

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,280
code of conduct can you describe some of

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,140
these approaches that you have yeah for

00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,550
America absolutely

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:40,140
so we empower brigade captains which are

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,080
the leaders of the brigade

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,780
so each brigade meets and physical

00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,450
spaces usually once a week or every

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,869
other week in those locations so we

00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:54,030
empower brigade captains to actually ask

00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:56,010
people to leave if they violated the

00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,290
code of conduct and it's pretty

00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,150
immediate so if somebody violates the

00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,609
code of conduct it's a hard line and

00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:05,609
there isn't necessarily like a

00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:07,050
remediation process if you violate the

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:10,020
code of conduct then you'll be asked to

00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,599
leave and you're not welcomed in in the

00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:14,700
space anymore and the code of conduct is

00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:17,310
designed so that the offenses are

00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,950
egregious enough and or in order to

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,589
warrant that and then we also have a

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,900
safe space email that goes to our team

00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:29,280
if somebody does have a code of conduct

00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:32,400
issue we have training in conflict

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,119
mediation and also resources to other

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,080
professionals who can help with code of

00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,080
conduct violations

00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:44,560
another question here today

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,369
how do you navigate when it comes to

00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:51,099
pain

00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:56,619
so

00:39:51,099 --> 00:40:00,729
sorry this how do you navigate when it

00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:03,699
comes to pay and being doing some of the

00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:08,589
projects that other male colleagues are

00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:11,079
doing and advocating for higher paid to

00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:13,449
be in a similar level as they are as a

00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:15,969
woman I feel that regardless of what

00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:19,269
area in tech you're going often your pay

00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:21,069
is slightly different from are you

00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:24,279
talking about just generally in the tech

00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:27,640
world training training training

00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:29,859
training training Paula nope does in

00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,199
addition to the technical programming

00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,359
classes we do workshops those workshops

00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,969
have become highly professional in

00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:38,799
nature over the last few years salary

00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:41,759
negotiation is one of our most popular

00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:44,619
and most requested we do mock

00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:45,849
negotiations we do kind of walkthroughs

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:49,209
we bring in

00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:52,269
recruiters we bring in heads of HR we

00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:54,180
actually give women the scripts that

00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:57,190
they are going to face in the workplace

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,949
so that they understand that if you

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:02,769
don't advocate for yourself and practice

00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:06,430
speaking out loud what you want to be

00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:10,029
valued at you will be undervalued by

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,999
everyone so I would say you know what we

00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:14,890
can do is we can empower women and we

00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:18,489
try to do that at how a new empower

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,859
women to understand that it is not so

00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:23,170
much a game but it is a skill that you

00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:25,359
really need to develop in order to be

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,579
compensated properly for your other

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,180
skills I know we have run out of time

00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:34,329
but very quickly know what the market

00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,249
rate is for your level there's plenty of

00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:40,220
information out there whether it's glass

00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:43,010
door or also ask other women

00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:46,000
in the same type of role but there's

00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:50,690
more and more transparency now AskMen

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,330
yeah so thank you everyone for for being

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:56,060
here and supporting this panel this is

00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:59,119
such an inspirational panel I love what

00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,980
you guys are doing you're using open

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,380
source and you're using technology to

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:07,160
uplift the world to welcome new people

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,830
