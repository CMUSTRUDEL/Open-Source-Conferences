[Music]

00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,940
good afternoon good afternoon everybody

00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,170
so my name is samson gaudi and we'll be

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,040
talking about the state of open source

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,739
in africa and here is sonia david and

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,680
also looking good so there's been some

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,440
couple of interesting question and

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,010
interest on what are the states of open

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,320
source how do we get more Africans to

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,480
participate on open source projects

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,699
would be open-source maintainer or to

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,210
look for ways to kind of localized

00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:55,339
contents that will bring more interest

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,070
from the continent yes it's not a

00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:02,620
country it's a continent with over 50

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,620
countries and I don't speak African

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,040
actually I'm from a country that have

00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:14,150
over 500 languages yes I speak English

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,460
so the aim of this conversation is to

00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,850
basically show the African commitment

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,400
towards open source and to introduce the

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,310
uniqueness of being an African in open

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,680
source and it also demonstrates the

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,510
collaborative efforts you know given the

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,400
recent report from github showing how

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,120
you know Africa has been growing really

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,370
big so so our actually this question

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Sonya do you want to tell us about by

00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:47,360
yourself and introduce yourself I'm also

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
the head of taken after link

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,890
it's a german-based company that is

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,640
focused on impact

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,420
building for startups and I'm glad to be

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,430
here today

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,460
yeah so baby do you want to take over

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,700
from here yeah hi and welcome to the

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,950
panel my name is David la Mayan I'm CTO

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,110
at code for Africa where the continents

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,170
largest civic tech organization

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:16,480
essentially we build technologies and

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:20,840
health innovations across journalism

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,420
government CSO's and we try to do that

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,480
thank look good

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,819
my name is Munem Timbo I'm a software

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,950
developer at a organization called open

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:37,500
up so our goal is to essentially an open

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,270
data organization that we try to help

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,709
citizens understand data so they can

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,680
make decisions about the community that

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,560
and even local government as well okay

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,470
so a little bit about me my name is

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,910
Samson Cody oversight board for a

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,350
project called sugar labs if you're

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,330
familiar with the One Laptop Per child

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,330
gets one give one get one free project

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,060
and I'm also building a community called

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,310
open source community Africa which you

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,709
know we also try to advocate more in the

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,239
open source continent so speaking about

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,220
open source Sonya do you want to tell us

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,180
your how did you get into open source

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,280
was it scary for you at first I think

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,450
for me I got into absolutes my mistake

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,950
I'm gonna bumped into it because

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,709
actually it starts off for the story of

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,420
how I became a programmer I learned to

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,200
code out of necessity to sort of

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,840
speakers up or in hyperinflation hit my

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,360
country I'm from South Sudan and when -

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,400
seishin got into my country I think our

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,950
currency was devalued by say a thousand

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,290
percent I no longer had a job I had to

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,329
find something to do and out of

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,540
necessity I'd learned I learned to code

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:49,320
I taught myself how to program and I

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,290
think one time I was using a tool to

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,160
build an application that I was working

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,290
on and I noticed a bug so I decided hey

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,780
I can point this out you know gee the

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,720
main taters hey I know this is bugging a

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,459
frog can I fix it and the feedback was

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,920
not so good but that was kind of my

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,650
first interaction with and I realized

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,750
all the things that I had to do around

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,650
open source contributing and that was

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,930
pretty much my journey so

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,549
what was it towards the cold side or

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,100
like documentation or like basically

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:25,250
trying to view the community what so it

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,260
was more of a bug-fix request because I

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,970
noticed I could run the program on my

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,860
side and it was not working because of

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,300
something that needed to be fixed and

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,360
when I made that recommendation I think

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,100
I had not followed the right steps you

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,400
know for Scott really because it turns

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,360
out you know there was all this

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,729
contributing to open source guidelines

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
that I had never interacted with and

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,979
that was pretty much how I ended up

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,810
learning about this whole you know

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:56,930
industry so you got into open source by

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:59,270
mistake it's been a sense I've been

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:04,100
learning about policies maintainer

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:07,220
policies and yeah so I'm David you run

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,340
code for Africa and you know what kind

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,800
of drive that idea you know it's

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,990
basically you know you have interest or

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,910
your programmer right are you building a

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,919
community so do you want to tell us more

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,490
about code for Africa what is code for

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,770
Africa I'm just you know for me here

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,760
that's kind of like tell it to like I

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,760
see if I'm a five year would make

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,349
interesting do Iran could factor no

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,419
definitely not okay a lot of us we're

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,630
currently have stuff in like eight

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,070
countries across a continent we have

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,680
organizations that are part of the

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,539
network in 22 other countries they're 54

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,570
countries and and and the on the

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:50,330
continent and we see ourselves as an

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,900
ecosystem builder almost like an impact

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,090
accelerator where we look to seed ideas

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,250
into the continent using leapfrog

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,710
technologies essentially taking what's

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,860
working in other countries and making it

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,380
as a solution here I mean as Sonia said

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,330
you know it's it's sort of you get into

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,330
open source sometimes by mistake and

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,550
then sometimes you are looking to solve

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,440
some solutions locally that have been

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:19,250
solved by other people across the globe

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,900
so what we figured out is we as code for

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,729
Africa are able to use some of this

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,140
technologies developed and simple

00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,539
technologies that have been developed

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,159
all over everything from air quality

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:31,249
sensors draw

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:34,099
and even small things like SMS solutions

00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:36,110
that we then also contribute to to the

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:39,019
open source community and try and

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,879
replicate it across the continent that

00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:45,949
sounds really interested and it's lovely

00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:48,169
I do you even sleep I I try to sleep a

00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,589
few hours but I mean when you're working

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:54,169
with teams from Mexico and South America

00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,879
it's really good so do you want to share

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:01,069
your experience how did you get it -

00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:05,029
open source by mistake or what kind of

00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:11,240
way from an innocent is that then ok

00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:13,580
names Windows Vista meet me I need to

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,189
find something else I can use that's all

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,779
got into Linux but when I got into it I

00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,369
didn't really know anything about the

00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,259
Linux and open source community so and

00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:22,490
one of the first problems ahead after

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,789
installing was that I didn't have any

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,409
wireless internet so I had to dig around

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,089
the documentation to find out how can I

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,639
actually get my wireless driver to work

00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,229
and that's how I met other developers

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,879
saying hey you try this program try this

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:37,099
program doesn't work for you write this

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,719
code send it to us and you'll see where

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,079
they can fix or not and there was my

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:44,209
real first introduction so I was so I

00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,409
was kind of forced to know what was

00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,360
going on so that can actually get my

00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,699
Wi-Fi drama to it so that was how I got

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,119
started

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:57,469
so David let's let's come back to or

00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:59,389
let's go back to Africa right you know

00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:03,259
when it comes to open source and the

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:05,899
reward open source we just this is you

00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,610
know focused on developers and you know

00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,259
in Africa there's a lot of interest you

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,229
know like towards the social good side

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:15,050
so how do you think that open source can

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,259
like kind of enhance opportunities for

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,209
journalists you know people that kind of

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,629
not really into like the whole technical

00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:25,490
side yeah do you think there's a an

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:26,270
opportunity on that side when the tour's

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,539
opens

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,069
movement I think I like the way you've

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:33,589
said it as sort of like the non

00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:35,300
technical teams you know outside of the

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:39,050
developers field so even even outside

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:43,070
the no more social for good change space

00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,570
my mother yeah last week was like David

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,640
what are you all the Mayan that's what

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,070
she calls me alum I and what is this

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,980
open source thing right what what does

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,930
open source mean and she was telling me

00:08:51,980 --> 00:09:00,140
enjoy yourself at the github so that's

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:01,730
that but but the idea of expanding you

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,399
know sort of the opportunity and the

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,920
access to open source we have found as

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,870
important to the ecosystem we're working

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,550
with much smaller budgets than most

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,600
other continents if you think about

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,720
America the GDP all of this access so

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,970
open source sort of reduces that barrier

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,740
for access to technology access to

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,010
solutions right if you can't pay a

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,899
massive licensing fee you essentially

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,330
can be able to spend that money in

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,880
paying other developers being able to

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,459
pay for journalism being able to pay for

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,470
the kind of activist or the kind of

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,839
government officials that you need on

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,050
the ground to do the job so for us we

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,450
see as open-source reducing that barrier

00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,010
but also reducing that cost for people

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,500
to be able to get access to this

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,290
technology to do the work to engage with

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,779
citizens now you did mention something

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,610
about costs which I want to know you in

00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:01,730
big into money so you know in you know

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,790
in San Francisco right and the technical

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,130
jobs here based on the cost of living of

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,440
this you know the city tends to go

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,860
really really high right now back in

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,829
Africa how do you think you know so I

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,930
come from a country where about sixty to

00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:20,930
seventy percent of the population under

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,660
the age of thirty right and within that

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,250
number most of the engineers and

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,430
software engineers are currently in

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,830
university or doing something that is

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,750
not working late that like you know

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,950
working in the industry and coming from

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,730
a country that 70% of the GDP focused on

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,580
crude you know petroleum not like

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,970
technology how do you get to compensate

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,980
you know or try to sell open-source to

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,779
somebody that is struggling in the

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,200
university trying to pay the bills you

00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:56,149
know how do you think companies or

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,670
organization should look for ways to

00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,680
compensate this engineers to build

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,149
software just that as David mentioned

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:10,630
towards you know billion things were

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:13,790
social game we're trying to find ways to

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,490
motivate if the mint is a free software

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,850
development of the continent to actually

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,959
increase free software development and

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:26,149
adoption and before we can even discuss

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,529
how to restructure the motivation itself

00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,290
we need to find out what actually drives

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:34,740
developers

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,990
what makes someone decide hey look I

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,150
want to contribute to building this free

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,070
software you know it's it's very

00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,410
different in the case of proprietary

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,010
software development because you have

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,050
almost an instant gratification for the

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,120
work that you do so I come to and hi as

00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,860
you they tell you how can you build this

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,560
software for us and it's how much you're

00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,960
going to pay you so it's almost instant

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,240
gratification well in the case of free

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,920
software development we have to deal

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,950
with a lot of deferred rewards for the

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,650
work that you do so maybe you fix about

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,690
you build a feature you build the entire

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,380
infrastructure and you can only get rid

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,870
of whoo words for what you do much later

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,090
I think one of the ways that we can flip

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:26,010
that motivation and reward system for

00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:29,180
Africa is maybe say look let's focus on

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:33,030
some of the key players or stakeholders

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,220
which in one is which some of what I

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,130
focus with on is working with

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,070
proprietary software builders

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,660
this is companies that hire developers

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,860
and what we try to do is we try to get

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:49,470
them to build software that is mixed so

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,750
it's half of it can be open source and

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,370
another half of it can be closed I can

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,980
give you a brief example or something

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,000
that we did

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:03,370
with a popular insurance company is we

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,510
caught them to build a model for simple

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,880
insurance based payments on mobile and

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,980
what we did is we got them to make the

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,620
entire infrastructure open source and

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,450
only get them to pay contributors for

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,680
customizing solution when they want to

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,930
sell it that way you can attract more

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,670
contributors to work on the coolest part

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,520
of it but they can also contribute on

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:30,670
the open source part of it I think

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,880
that's a very brilliant idea and not

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:37,000
speaking about you know money and you

00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,340
know sustainability in Africa so I I you

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,220
know part of stuff I do when I'm not

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,680
coding I you know do some work for the

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,760
community

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,220
this is this thing called the African

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,830
girls can code towards the nonprofit

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,190
side I serve as a contractor for the

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,200
United Nation building a culture where

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,210
we train African groups on technology

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,450
which obviously you know do lot of

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:04,290
things around nonprofit so you know just

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:08,290
six months ago I was in Addis Ababa and

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,870
we obviously they wanted us to you know

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,700
teach the girls on coding but then was

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,610
looking for a way not to spend a lot of

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,680
money on software and well the funny

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,110
thing is I can easily just you know tell

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,570
them oh I can teach them basic gates and

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,000
github right how to do version control

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:30,150
how to go to WC school you know

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,440
referenced HTML CSS and JavaScript now

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,420
towards the nonprofit side and towards

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,010
the NGO so how do you think or leverage

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:42,250
in open source as a as a main tool can

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,070
help saving save a lot of money like in

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,800
terms of like cost because you know like

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,320
she mentioned our government tend to

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,140
spend a lot of money on licensing you

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,710
know and as an NGO right not everybody

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,750
have that huge reserve of money as the

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,100
government so what you're taught around

00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:04,040
that

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,139
in general most NGOs they don't really

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,569
know about about open-source software

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:12,079
they know about the commercial space

00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:15,769
cause it's the safe choice so when we

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,509
approach NGOs we try and just tell them

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,089
but hey there is an alternative solution

00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:21,529
to the to this commercial product and at

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:22,999
the same times all you also be saving a

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,249
lot of money and you will get

00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:27,079
maintenance so one of the one of the

00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:29,329
biggest fears is that oh this is open

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,220
source product it's not no one no one is

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:34,069
responsible for it but then once we

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,799
actually go to go go go through the

00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:38,420
process x2 what is how it works what the

00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,129
main tenets are then the X you start

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,689
seeing that oh actually this is a

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:43,189
valuable thing and that this is

00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,899
something that can last us for a couple

00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:45,829
years and then we don't really have to

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,779
depend on anybody

00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:49,639
weak sorry we don't have to depend on a

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,839
particular company we can depend on

00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:54,709
other developers who are interested in

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,629
what we are doing as well so it's so so

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,610
the NGOs are more receptive to that but

00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:01,549
the government is still a bit finicky

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,829
that they still want come commercial

00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,899
products with the vendor so we trying to

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,699
get into the space where we trying to

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,929
talk come that open source not a scary

00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,980
piece it's something that is

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:14,389
maintainable and sustainable as well now

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,910
you know we've talked about money we've

00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:19,249
talked about you know community and you

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,309
know ecosystem talk about you know

00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:23,959
saving money as an angel but now let's

00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:25,730
let's come back to the actual

00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,309
contribution you know I know in the

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,619
South a lot of open-source maintainer

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:33,949
waiting to hear how to view the next

00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:36,980
billion craters now speaking about

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,629
advocacy right there's been the recent

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,689
report from the October's you know

00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:44,860
stating how you know countries you know

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:47,179
like Nigeria Kenya and you know

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,949
Morocco I think some couple of countries

00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:51,379
are the northern side of Africa

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,869
I've been great really really well what

00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:55,369
do you think is driving this force you

00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:58,850
know I know you know you're from South

00:16:55,369 --> 00:17:00,319
Africa South Sudan and also in Kenya kay

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,999
is also very big in terms of like

00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,649
development space so what do you think

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,209
is driving this force because if you

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,329
looking you know compared to other

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,120
continents like you know not America or

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,980
Europe or Asia

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,470
just like what I mentioned right most of

00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,539
this engineers and students they they

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,659
don't work for Google or Facebook or

00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:24,260
github or Microsoft's and not everybody

00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:26,120
get that opportunity to to get paid to

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,350
work for open-source so what do you

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,909
think is driving that force all actual

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,500
contributions do you think like there's

00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:35,500
an advocacy vibe going on another

00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,110
alternative to proprietary software one

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,230
of the things that we are finding as

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,010
well and how longer said it is that a

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:51,640
lot of governments a lot of commercial

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,360
sort of entities and even bigger

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,210
organizations that are more established

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,370
are most worried about maintainability

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,350
and I think that's one of the things

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,409
that we're finding is that cost of

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,690
maintainability or maintenance being

00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:10,039
reduced by taking up open-source

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,049
software and we feel that therefore and

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,850
this is why we we feel that we need to

00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:17,179
build an ecosystem because we need to

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,919
close those skills gaps right and by

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,860
closing those skills gaps is by being

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,250
able to being able to give people access

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:27,860
to code access to software and building

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,529
that ecosystem such that more people are

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,990
able to maintain this code more people

00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,610
able to contribute and be able to even

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,399
be hired within the government

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,799
institutions within the NGOs within even

00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:42,399
the corporates to be able to make this

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,870
code available and so for us I think

00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:47,330
what's driving that change what's

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,429
driving that uptick is that people are

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,770
being able to see that with this gap

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:54,409
when you close this scale gap you're

00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,160
able to actually reduce your cost of

00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:57,320
maintenance

00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,660
and you cost of development and and even

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,240
a adoption of some of the latest

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:04,610
technologies Sonya since you were more

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,620
focus around money do you have any

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,660
comments yet I mean I'm glad that you

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,400
mentioned closing the skills gap because

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,470
like I mentioned some of the work that

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,120
we do are after link working with them

00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:19,430
startups is building the tech developer

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,380
pipeline as well in the way that we do

00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,630
that is by working with developers at

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,910
every level where they come at you know

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,970
beginners intermediate or even experts

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,650
and in the startups or the companies

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,710
that we choose to work with in our

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,330
impact of acceleration programs what we

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,700
tend to do is we try to make sure that

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,580
at least 50% of the startups that we

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,860
work with are building free software or

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,980
open source software so that developers

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,320
who then get placed into these company

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,270
companies or startups you know as

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,600
interns or police there for mentorship

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:55,700
or place their event for jobs I get the

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,390
opportunity to work or contribute to

00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,500
open source and I think if we get more

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,080
organizations doing something like this

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,240
then we can see the increase in open

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,000
source contribution to not just maybe

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,010
increasing by 40 percent maybe even 50

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,360
or 60 percent in the next few years

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:16,820
okay so looking at how is the open

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:21,140
source community particularly in South

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,480
Africa I don't I think the community is

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,150
not as big as nature in Kenya but I

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,490
think we're starting to see episodes

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:31,490
start to take hold in South Africa

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,770
because I'm we've created a a community

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,080
branch a creamy a community version of

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,790
our organization and what we found is

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,430
that people are actually starting to

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,600
come to these meetups and they actually

00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,820
start they actually want to start

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,770
working on projects because I'm one of

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,300
our one of our goals is to actual got

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:54,170
three whizzer to use an organization but

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,810
in inform empower and activate so inform

00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:59,360
people that something like this exists

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,430
in power means that they can actually do

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,990
something about it and to activate means

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,240
that they can start engaging with

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,440
government so once we so once we go

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,900
through all those steps then they can

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,030
see that oh this is a useful thing

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,590
and we've got the tools to actually

00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,020
start working with government let's

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,690
start working on projects so and that's

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,460
all so that's all and and what you've

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,170
seen for exclusive this is that our

00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,610
community has grown more and more and

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,350
more because of something to say that

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,210
hey guys we've got these cool products

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,590
that that people are going to work on do

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,090
you want to come contribute it's open

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,010
source you don't have to be developer

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,320
because I think sometimes we focus too

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,570
much on the tech but in some cases even

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,280
a designer can come and actually make a

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,850
good contribution to a project yeah so

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,960
we try not to exclude sorry so so we

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,730
tried not to only talk to developers

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,500
which I talk to people from different

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,760
Englishes as well because well it's

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,380
cause we even because we started to get

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,360
lawyers coming to our meetups as well

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,040
they want to like they want to see where

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,430
are the tools that they use to improve

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,020
their their law process so so having

00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,390
that thing that hey this open-source

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,340
product page can use all and open source

00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,580
Meetup you can actually start seeing

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,280
what's going on yeah interesting because

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,680
you mentioned about like you know like I

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,680
said one of the challenges of defining

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,600
open source to newly or new comments

00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,450
this standard needs to be a software

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,480
engineer and code in order to be of

00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,180
interest which you know what we do at

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,440
the open source community Africa which

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:30,940
you know I co-founded last cup of last

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,280
year actually is to actually drive this

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:36,890
huge you know ecosystem of having

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,320
designers you know content creators you

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,910
know people that can actually see how it

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,380
could be some business model or out of

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,660
some you know open source project and

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:47,960
you know I think it's kind of like based

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,820
on how personal I got into open source

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,530
you know I got access to the wall after

00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,370
patch art projects a couple of years

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,410
back and I started using the tool of the

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,030
computer and I got interested in how

00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:04,130
things work because I like breaking

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:06,470
things and so I think I kind of like got

00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,510
my way around the OS you know Len spider

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,360
and created a game blah blah blah and

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,210
now became a maintainer for that

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,870
organization and what as a maintainer

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:21,320
for a project that is focused on

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,759
education and then in terms of like age

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,219
range between a

00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:30,199
2:16 it's kind of like you know

00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:32,629
difficult right to explain how just to

00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:34,070
put it into context we every year a true

00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:37,219
project like the google Summer of Code

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,929
and go coding we receive lots lots of

00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:41,719
young people in the community you know

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,339
my job is to help mentor to make sure

00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:47,179
this they actually follow kind of

00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:50,119
conduct and not fight around the thing

00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:52,369
is even back in Africa right if you want

00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,859
to host or if you're doing an open

00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:58,639
source focused event

00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:59,859
you always get engineers or people

00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,969
writing code and then when you actually

00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:05,779
designers hey why are you guys know

00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:08,749
they're like is it free or is it not

00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,579
free how much are you paying me you know

00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:12,409
that's that's kind of vibe right and

00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:15,829
it's it's almost difficult to explain to

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:18,649
a designer that pays from the computer

00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:20,779
to the to to licensing you know compared

00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:22,699
to the actual engineering where that you

00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:24,229
can just go copy or copy and paste of

00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:27,649
goods spend your time on Stack Overflow

00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:30,709
so you know this has been the challenges

00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:33,709
of you know trying to build it well it's

00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:35,629
not really like you know during a

00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:37,369
diversity bidding diversity into

00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:38,509
open-source you know we're coming

00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:41,779
I don't want to use the word

00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:43,669
non-technical but bringing designers you

00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,889
know content creators and you know

00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:48,169
because anybody can write code let's

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:49,729
let's just be real right so how do you

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:51,409
think should be the interest because

00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:53,899
mind you there's a lot of open-source

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:56,179
maintainer here my particularly of focus

00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:59,629
on this the stop it hardly gets welcome

00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:03,049
people that don't write code as as a day

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:04,159
to avoid a trailer design answer so what

00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:07,759
it's like the selling point what do you

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,039
think we should focus on I think one of

00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,259
the first things that you should focus

00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,319
on is interest like do they have

00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:16,069
interest in a particular field energy

00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:18,459
that they're looking for

00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,459
so

00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,690
yeah so so so usually what we what we

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,600
suddenly see is that we get we'll get

00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,870
say a a journalist who come to us and

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,330
ask us hey I'm interested in finding out

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,550
whether I like what's going on with

00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,700
evictions in my town but I don't know

00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,140
where to start and that in I don't we

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,700
start with in the process so so

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,050
immediately we know that we know that we

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,960
can seed okay this is not a technical

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,840
person but let's let's tell them what is

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,680
available let's help them go through the

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,510
process and then and then and then from

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,030
then from there they can start seeing

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,840
that oh actually I can I can build I can

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:05,930
build a product without necessarily them

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,680
knowing how to code so I'm also we also

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:12,350
am trying to remove the word technical

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,540
or code or hackathon because that

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,790
immediately excludes different people

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,580
so for hackathons especially we try to

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,380
we try to always combine technical

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,540
people with non-technical people so that

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,760
M as we saw that we as developers can

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,550
gain a different perspective as to how

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,710
to think about a problem and and then

00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,840
once people can see that I can I can

00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,250
make a difference even though I'm not I

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,140
can make a difference to a project even

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,460
though I'm not technical that'll give

00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,800
the motivation to actually come back and

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,110
continue work here more projects okay I

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,920
think that's a very good question now

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:49,600
back to advocacy

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:51,940
so some some weeks back I was at the

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,770
open source summit and you know somebody

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,620
asked me one interesting questions like

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,480
hey Samson I noticed you know I have you

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,070
know in my community I have a lot of you

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,710
know Africans contribute to open source

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:06,270
but for some reason they don't apply to

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,650
speak global conferences and I was like

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:11,710
should I tell you like in my mind I was

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,840
like should I really go in like should I

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:15,880
actually explained the problem or should

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,890
I just you know kind of shy away from it

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:21,340
because obviously we should be five here

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:26,440
right and somebody got you know some

00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:29,350
visa issue and so what do you think well

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,230
I kind of I'm gonna come back to what

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,080
I'm I just leave the open source

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,660
festival at the end of the talk but what

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,040
do you think you know for global

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,620
conferences like for example github

00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,870
universe you know

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,940
yes contribute to open source is one you

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,520
know setting meetups is true but then

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,380
meeting people getting to talk to people

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,830
is really awesome you know networking is

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:57,610
great but the real problem here is

00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:59,820
issues of visas how do you think we can

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:04,150
tackle that problem is it by bringing

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,890
conferences down to Africa or what do

00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,350
you think is the problem in order to

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,790
solve that because of course our case is

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,650
18 you know you need to go there talk

00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,299
about what you do in Africa but then

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,390
there's that big brother which is visa

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:19,090
you know you always like the first time

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,950
I got my u.s. visa in 2017 I spent

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,890
roughly 15 minutes explaining to the

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,960
officer I need a visa which is crazy so

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,280
you know so what's your what's your tote

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,090
around that I don't know if Sonia you

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:36,160
know comment on that not on the visa

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:37,890
issue but no I like the point that you

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,260
brought up about maybe bringing

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:44,770
conferences or people were interested in

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,419
open source to developers or people are

00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,120
interested in the free software industry

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:51,299
to the continent and I think there's a

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,470
lot of ways that people can do that

00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,640
personally I'm excited about the

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,650
announcements that could have made

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,050
yesterday at the keynote about

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,870
get up for mobile and kidnap sponsorship

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:03,190
I think those two things combined with

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,290
maybe voice-to-text

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,050
is going to change how developers

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,990
interact you know with them open source

00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:13,960
because I don't know about the

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,910
statistics about Internet connectivity

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,460
just yet but I know that almost every

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,800
African has a mobile device and if they

00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,540
can now use github on their mobile

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,210
device I think it can improve the way

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:28,809
that they contribute or even create

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:30,550
repositories et Cie and maybe the

00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,770
sponsorship program will encourage more

00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:36,309
people in each country because then they

00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:39,160
can see ok maybe there is every word for

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,660
the work that I do and for independent

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,690
developers or maintenance who are

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,340
interested in working with developers

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,980
may be as mentorship there's lots of

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,980
organizations in on the continent even

00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,450
in Europe in Africa that are creating

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,059
peer-to-peer mentorship opportunities

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:58,059
right so if you can find some of these

00:29:55,059 --> 00:30:01,720
organizations and maybe try to you know

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:03,910
sign up or even offer yourself to be a

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,570
mentor some of these people it will

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,860
maybe go a long way to improving the way

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,809
open-source is run the free software

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,720
industry is run and maybe increase the

00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:17,950
number of developers that we have in the

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,200
end so I am gonna focus on the audience

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,150
now do you have any questions regarding

00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,850
yeah I've seen your hand there

00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:34,350
I've seen the other hand and your other

00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:34,350
question one more that's one two okay

00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,999
okay awesome

00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:08,470
thank you very much for sharing your

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:11,289
experiences and giving us some insights

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,840
around things going on in Africa I want

00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,909
to share - some thoughts and also ask

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,070
you a few questions now historically

00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:20,320
Microsoft and many of the bigger

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:23,289
companies that always sell licenses have

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,169
dominated the tech space in Africa

00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:28,360
selling licenses and the first computers

00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:30,990
most of us ever got to know where

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,840
Microsoft computers the point being that

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:38,639
what do you think you can do from high

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,049
up to make sure that we have access to

00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,360
computers that I don't necessarily

00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,769
Microsoft computers and there's a reason

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
why I ask this question

00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,960
because you find out that people are

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,340
encouraged to buy pirated software

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,110
because they cannot avoid licenses so

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,820
what are your thoughts around getting

00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,419
access to computers that's number one

00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:01,029
number two is that with respect to

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,610
access to environments like San

00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:05,649
Francisco or other software hubs where

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,590
people do a lot of things what are your

00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:10,419
thoughts around online partnerships like

00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,519
expanding those because I think if you

00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:14,529
go into the issue of visas I know that I

00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,590
feel that those are more in the

00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:19,240
political space and with the wonderful

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,340
things that my fellow Nigerian brothers

00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,750
have been doing recently I'm not sure

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,970
that visas are going to be coming easy

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:27,509
so my point being that what are some of

00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:30,490
your efforts around getting

00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:36,610
remote partnerships and then last

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:39,759
question is I forgot okay do you want to

00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:43,450
study first question yeah I can I can

00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:45,580
take a gander at the first one how do

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,830
you get more computers into more

00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,850
people's hands that are in proprietary

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,639
software

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:54,519
I think lunga talked about you know sort

00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:56,950
of how he had Vista problems Windows

00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,460
Vista the first operating system I knew

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:07,389
was windows when github they're owned by

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:09,580
Microsoft right so but the thing is like

00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:11,740
you say it's about and and I think it's

00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,490
connected to your second question how do

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:19,480
you get more people online who are in

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,890
countries in different cities and that's

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,990
a beauty of the internet being able to

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,630
connect with each other to be able to

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:28,929
share and say hey how can we use Linux

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:31,540
how can we use open free software or how

00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:34,000
can we be able to encourage each other

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,770
to move away from more proprietary

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,630
systems to use things that are more

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,850
accessible to us and how do we use that

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,220
because it takes a community if my

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,260
friend is using Linux I'm more likely to

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,290
use Linux if my friend is using muck

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,240
I'm more likely to use Mac or Mac OS as

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,830
they call it so it's that sense of

00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,140
community and building that kind of

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,860
ecosystem and I feel that in on the

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,870
continent

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,990
we are ripe for that because we have so

00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,890
much faster Internet connectivity today

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,080
we're trying to build these communities

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,870
on open source software meaning that

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,840
we're not just doing it at a level of

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:11,679
hey this is a Facebook group no this is

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,570
an actual utility that we're using and

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,450
that we're building to solve the

00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,000
problems that we have so I feel that

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:20,859
definitely being able to do those github

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,929
communities doing community meetups like

00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,359
the hacks hackers or the open source

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,730
community meetups really encouraging

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,830
that vibe is something that we could

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,899
definitely grow and anything if I can

00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:35,139
answer that my mind was a little bit

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:37,270
different yes Greenup has a kid does

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,970
windows everywhere mine was different

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:42,340
because the computer I got came with I

00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,379
think he was at a point with fedora for

00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:49,629
the right 10 I can't remember the

00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:51,760
version so in classroom of school of a

00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:55,210
thousand people every every kid in that

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,430
school gate got the fedora and growing

00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,240
up with that computer was very difficult

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:04,960
for me because I got to use some you

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,060
know programs that are not normal to my

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,320
community so in terms of like sharing

00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,830
things were kind of difficult because

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,310
you know five systems are different but

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:17,590
I think as you grasp to do the influence

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,100
of computing you know 10 15 years ago

00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:23,980
you know speaking from Nigeria in

00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,990
particular is was kind of a you know

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,170
partnership based on the government

00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,089
because again the RPC project was was

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,400
of a partnership if you go to Rwanda

00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,380
right now there's four hundred forty

00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,930
thousand of those or PC computers

00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,900
sitting right sitting in classrooms in

00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:44,260
primary schools in Rwanda and to show I

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:48,010
think it's based on but the the how the

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,900
government want to to drive the economy

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,740
the Rwanda government wants some kind of

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,270
an open government more like open

00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,220
government to the citizen and they

00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:01,930
decided Oh instead of putting Windows or

00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,849
one proprietary operating system they

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,369
decided to go with you know Linux

00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,380
everywhere which is you know beauty if

00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,180
you pay attention to Rwanda in the last

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,059
two years it's been really good in terms

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,829
of you know technology so I don't know

00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:18,069
if that's answer your question all right

00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:26,079
I think there's one more okay okay on

00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:28,270
that last one yeah and so building a

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,819
grassroots movement is about connecting

00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,250
people obviously but for it to be

00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:34,750
sustained beyond just volunteerism you

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,829
need to start getting institutional

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:40,569
buying and support so speaking

00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,369
specifically to South Africa and East

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:45,339
Africa because I know those cases better

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:47,680
can you guys share with us what large

00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:50,589
institutions are putting support behind

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,349
open source solutions and are we seeing

00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:55,690
any early adopter kind of role model

00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:58,030
organization specifically in in

00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,760
governments or kind of the for good

00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:04,619
space that are proving the stuff is

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,619
possible by deploying at scale

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,660
don't try to speak about proprietary

00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:15,650
companies and then maybe he can talk

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:18,980
about open governments I know there's

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,960
always pushback from companies that you

00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,480
know if they if they have to come out

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,330
and admit that they're either utilizing

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,640
free software then maybe they get the

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,440
pushback that they need to contribute to

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,520
free software in one way or another

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,100
so maybe the companies that do

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:40,790
contribute to free software

00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:44,600
implementation and adoption

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:46,580
we still see very companies sent to

00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,380
still be very reluctant to admit that

00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,350
they are contributing to free software

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,350
or even using free software and I think

00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:56,300
that is work that we still have to do to

00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,920
make sure that we see this increase on

00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,420
the continents in the next few years I

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,320
will know some of the biggest companies

00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,060
in Kenya use free software but the

00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,180
software that they still release to date

00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:11,570
are clothes softer as private private

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,610
softwares and I think that is still work

00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,210
that we have to do to ensure that

00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:19,640
companies huge companies small companies

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:24,680
are actually pushing the drive to

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,650
adoption for free software yeah by

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,560
people like the World Bank and the UN as

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,600
part of the contracting systems we're

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,150
helping them shape that they should put

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,010
in there that it should be open source

00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,050
if they are contracting and if there's

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,420
any consulting that it should be free

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:45,470
software also at code for Africa all our

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:48,650
grant systems has to be open source so

00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,650
[Music]

00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,700
hi everyone

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,250
it's great to see the panelists here

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,450
really really awesome I've had the

00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,250
pleasure working all throughout the

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,320
African continent and I think one thing

00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,850
that is always interesting when I come

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,350
back to the States is that a lot of

00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,030
people don't realize the diversity in

00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,340
the continent not just for the languages

00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,990
and for the ethnic groups but also for

00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,660
the the economies and the way in which

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,910
the economies function so my question is

00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,369
because I think a lot of especially

00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,930
Americans North Americans feel that when

00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:23,580
you talk about Africa it has to be

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,200
driven by the UN it has to be the World

00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,210
Bank it has to be nonprofits in the

00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,190
social sector which is obviously very

00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,410
important there's a huge commercial

00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,359
sector in Lagos in Johannesburg and Cape

00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,940
Town and so many major cities across the

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,260
continent so my question for you is what

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,609
are some of the great examples you've

00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,350
seen an open source both in the

00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:42,750
commercial private tax sector but then

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,280
also running the gamut to nonprofits on

00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,750
the social sector what are the what are

00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,430
the projects and the organizations we

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,170
should be paying attention to other than

00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:52,050
yours of course

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,050
[Laughter]

00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,869
so for us we have been able to see a

00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,960
couple of people in Nairobi I think

00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:06,540
you've heard of owner data they do Data

00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,820
Solutions open data solutions as well as

00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,570
a few for I mean that the public sector

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:18,000
I think yeah we're doing well the

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:19,830
commercial sector that are working in

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,260
Africa that are building free software

00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:23,700
and maybe if you have time because we

00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,340
have maybe 30 seconds left

00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,880
I can I can give you a list of some of

00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:33,750
my favorite open-source software

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,720
companies yeah so I think it's you know

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:39,119
it's really awesome to you know I'm just

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,190
gonna like end the statement here saying

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,410
you know it's it's very important to see

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,210
you know the numbers grow in Africa

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,640
towards open-source and I'm you know

00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:49,530
very very passionate to make that work

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,109
and that's why we have the open source

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,570
first of all coming up February 20th to

00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:58,440
