Title: Brian Kardell -  Celebrating 30 Years and Enhancing the Web Commons (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)
Publication date: 2020-01-17
Playlist: Abstractions II Raw Cuts
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

In the past 30 years, the Web Platform has come to enable so much of our modern world. We're all familiar with the most obvious examples, but did you know the Web Platform has been used to create phone applications, games, art, billboards, kiosks, print, television, automobile and appliance interfaces?

In this talk, I'll show how pervasive and fundamental the use of web technologies is, and why it's important to protect the commons of the Web Platform. I will present the interesting history of shrewd decisions, happy accidents, struggles and wrong turns that led us to this point.

Then, we'll take a look at the complex realities of standards work today. How can we tend the Web Platform to keep it flourishing for another 30 years and beyond? What do we need to be prioritizing right now? And how can you get involved from the trenches of web development?
