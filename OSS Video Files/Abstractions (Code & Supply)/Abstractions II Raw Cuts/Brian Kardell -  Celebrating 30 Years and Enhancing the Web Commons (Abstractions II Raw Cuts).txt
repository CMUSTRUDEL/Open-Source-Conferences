Title: Brian Kardell -  Celebrating 30 Years and Enhancing the Web Commons (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)
Publication date: 2020-01-17
Playlist: Abstractions II Raw Cuts
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

In the past 30 years, the Web Platform has come to enable so much of our modern world. We're all familiar with the most obvious examples, but did you know the Web Platform has been used to create phone applications, games, art, billboards, kiosks, print, television, automobile and appliance interfaces?

In this talk, I'll show how pervasive and fundamental the use of web technologies is, and why it's important to protect the commons of the Web Platform. I will present the interesting history of shrewd decisions, happy accidents, struggles and wrong turns that led us to this point.

Then, we'll take a look at the complex realities of standards work today. How can we tend the Web Platform to keep it flourishing for another 30 years and beyond? What do we need to be prioritizing right now? And how can you get involved from the trenches of web development?

all right so this is me I'm a developer

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,630
advocate at agalya and I'm affiliated

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:11,099
with the open J's foundation and w3c I

00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,049
think the web is amazing and I think

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,350
that's like self-evident I don't think

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,710
it requires to prove for anything but if

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,720
you program on the web

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,619
chances are you think hmm this could be

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:30,179
better so I want to ask a question which

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:33,870
is how likely do you think this is that

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,280
in 30 years from now in 20 49 we'll be

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,559
out of big conference like this and

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,860
people will be interested and excited

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,700
about things happening in the web that

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,110
is a really really long time and it

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,739
seems almost hard to believe there's

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:54,420
definitely people giving definitely

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:57,149
people giving talks here whose entire

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,600
lives have not been 30 years yet it's

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,280
hard to imagine that we would be there

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,500
but this is relevant because we're here

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,189
we're halfway there because this year

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,189
the web is 30 years old which is kind of

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,130
mind-blowing and also like maybe a

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,770
little depressing like if you think why

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,560
are we only here right so I want to

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,680
convince you that in fact it very much

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,509
is getting better and I'm gonna do that

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,330
by telling you about the history and the

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,630
Senate sort of five major areas that I

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,009
see in the web and I'm gonna make the

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,590
case that the second half was better

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,150
than the first half and the second half

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,759
of that was better than the first half

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,270
of that and the second half of that was

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,040
better than the first half of that so

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,280
basically it's getting better faster and

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,869
a lot of this has to do with like us

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,030
learning along the way and correcting

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,130
our notions of what the future would

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,899
look like and standardization and

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,950
competition and licensing and how

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:06,630
businesses would work this is going to

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,280
be okay basically is the message

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,899
so we're going to run through the first

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
half I've warned you I spent a little

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,010
bit too much time on the beginning

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,560
because there's some important bits if

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,780
we can hop in our car in our flying car

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,280
there and go back to the beginning of

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,290
the web it was born into chaos and by

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,800
chaos I mean we had no idea what we're

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,900
doing like literally no idea and I don't

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,540
mean the web I mean like all of it

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,680
computers hardware the Internet laws

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,780
surrounding those software licensing

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,090
we've had some experience with

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,800
standardization about physical things

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,500
and we've gotten kind of good at that

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,200
but all of this stuff somehow seems new

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,209
and it's like all piling up and we're

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,709
totally unprepared when the web comes

00:02:51,209 --> 00:03:01,290
along in 1989 this is Tim's proposal for

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:03,030
the web it's eight pages and it's not

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,140
the internet that was thirty years

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,209
before Ben Cerf it's not the idea of

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,940
hypertext that was Ted Nelson also way

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,570
before it's not programs that do

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,370
hypertext those already also existed

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:19,410
it's not documents marked out with tags

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,769
that was Charles Goldfarb also way way

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,769
before it's not even things that did

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,709
lots of those things this is Ian Ritchie

00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,900
this is his program guide and it was a

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:37,049
hypermedia program that was popular for

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,989
Windows and Mac at the time and it

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,450
stored its documents in this sgml format

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,519
with the anglia braces and it called

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,570
those things hypertext markup language

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,070
so if that sounds a lot like a browser

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,829
to you Tim berners-lee thought so too

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,420
and Tim berners-lee had no interest in

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,810
building a browser he thought this is a

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,690
really good thing and what I really want

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,489
is just I want you to imagine all this

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,600
stuff is just universally addressable

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,600
and referenceable and we can link to it

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,239
that was the big idea and in Ritchie and

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:17,370
everyone at the conference said kind of

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,260
no they couldn't imagine it and

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,109
like I have this alternate timeline here

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,630
because like imagine that he had like

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,060
this was a proprietary shrink product

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,460
that was already shipping imagine like

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,780
that was the first browser like what

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,280
would have happened we'll never know but

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,050
I I expect it probably wouldn't be good

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,090
actually

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,380
so Tim says I guess I have to build it

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,850
at CERN and this leads to a shrewd move

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,900
of it like a lot of people don't talk

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,290
about but I feel like it's really

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,440
important a lot of Tim's proposal was

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,310
like the Seinfeld pitch nothing or as

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,590
little as possible

00:04:52,310 --> 00:05:02,010
in Tim's mind web content already

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:03,419
existed like it already existed but what

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,490
about this right like I mean how could

00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:08,880
it exist you need HTML the web like what

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,010
is the web without HTML so clearly he

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,690
had to do this in order to get the web

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,370
really right I mean it sounds like

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,870
cheating to say that it exists without

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:22,140
HTML but Tim said I don't know it kind

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,210
of already does exist just at CERN alone

00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,620
the thing he was complaining about is we

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,140
have all these document systems but

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,970
here's one CERN doc it has tens of

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,030
thousands of these documents and they

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,300
have headings and paragraphs and lists

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,220
and Tim says uh yeah I mean I just

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,750
parsed that and just the paragraphs I'm

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,280
listening I ignored the rest and that's

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,780
HTML um so he goes off and creates the

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,690
first browser and the first browser is

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,150
rewrite and he thinks you know using

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,340
this basically people will go and make

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,570
notes about the word doc in another

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,570
system and this thing and that thing

00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,570
Thanks

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,900
but a side effect of this that's really

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,659
really interesting is that Tim

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,490
berners-lee he didn't know sgml another

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,729
thing that would have happened if Ian

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,650
Ricci had made it with his sgml thing is

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,719
that you would have had proper sgml

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,599
parsing but Tim didn't know that and he

00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:23,650
just you know first what he understood

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:26,020
and as a result it had completely

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,419
different characteristics it was really

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:34,210
forgiving for one and so he was able to

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:36,009
show this and other people got

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,680
interested and the first several

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:41,080
browsers were for the Commons like there

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,330
were hackers that built it and shared it

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,949
and they were all free open licensing

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:50,860
and those people they wanted more from

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,500
HTML and Tim said well yeah I mean sure

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:59,710
why not because like this was HTML this

00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:02,439
like it was nothing so they experimented

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,060
and I want to stress like what they what

00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,969
it means they experimented you see how

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:11,139
much nothing the other side had this is

00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:14,740
1992 this is pay way creates this

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:16,479
virtual machine called an a programming

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,219
language called viola is the viola

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,110
virtual machine and you had build a

00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:23,469
browser would just be another program on

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:26,289
that and you see he had frames

00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:28,930
he had style sheets he had tables he had

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:33,639
inline images and applets on the web in

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:38,469
1992 that's pretty different than what

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:40,479
Tim it's kind of hard to overstate the

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:44,550
importance of that biola browser I think

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:48,400
and these are like echoes in history I'm

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,430
foreshadowing so one of the things that

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,610
happens actually is one of the guys at

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,569
NCSA

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,610
gets this and he shows it the viola

00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:02,979
browser to Eric veena and Marc

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:06,610
Andreessen and mosaic is born

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:09,219
now mosaic is actually proprietary

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,240
software but it has a really generous

00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,979
license

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,669
it's kind of like free to get you hooked

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:14,669
definitely

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,090
then famously in 1993 CERN puts their

00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,139
software and the like the licensing for

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,289
intellectual property and everything

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,849
into public domain for everyone so this

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:32,229
is really sort of the beginning of what

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:37,959
I mean by the comments like when does it

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:42,099
start becoming really for everyone this

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:46,180
is the time we're now 1994 two percent

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,010
of US households have internet almost

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,660
nobody who has internet knows about the

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,209
web this is a tiny tiny number of people

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,600
and this is when mosaic starts getting

00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,209
popular

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:59,020
within months seventy-five percent of

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:01,450
browsers are mosaic they really control

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,810
everything it was really slow was not

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,240
pleasant in a lot of ways but it had

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,640
this thing has quality you could view

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,380
the source and it has this other quality

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,730
because of Tim's you know mistake

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,010
basically that you could even make an

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,820
error and you would still get some stuff

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,399
and then you would send it to someone in

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,670
a link and Wow

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,920
like I mean like this is funny but this

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:35,560
is what it felt like really like legit

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:38,260
seriously it felt like magic so for the

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,959
next several years at the very beginning

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,470
we got the beginning of Netscape is

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,089
founded as a for-profit company

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:51,790
internally the code name for that was

00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:54,089
mosaic iller which became Mozilla and we

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,950
got the creation of JavaScript and

00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:00,820
Internet Explorer actually was created

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:05,130
by licensing the mosaic browser early

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,829
mosaic browser the beginning of the w3c

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,360
trying to standardize HTML it's kind of

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:13,930
a mess right I mean there's just kind of

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,579
this mess that's happening and so that's

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:18,670
why you see a lot of the things on that

00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:22,589
other slide are about like trying to

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,589
standardize HTML to HTML 3

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,540
it's unsurprising that Tim would say I

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,500
feel like we need some standards or

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,440
something that will prevent this

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,570
fracturing that might kill the web and

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,570
like I was on I'm controversial like of

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,980
course obviously right like a if they if

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,180
you can't get two things to read the

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,740
same thing it's not gonna work

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,649
the trouble is how do you do that

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:51,140
exactly and like I said we don't know we

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,660
have all these standards organizations

00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,450
and why are there so many and why do

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,060
they all work differently though I mean

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:05,329
the answer is pretty simple is like we

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:10,160
don't know so in 1995 I feel like I

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:14,360
missed the slide here okay well we'll

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,519
roll with this in 1995 Sun creates Java

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,490
which should look very familiar right I

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,019
mean it is literally pay ways design and

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,700
browser and every plate the whole thing

00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:27,470
is exactly the same now people today

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,060
would think like that's not the web what

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,000
are you doing it's like crazy like

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,520
that's not the web surely Tim

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,390
berners-lee was like Gandalf like no you

00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,190
shall pass right but like Tim's reaction

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,680
was like pretty different than that

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,459
actually Tim was kind of like yeah it

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,709
looks pretty good actually at least you

00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,550
know for real applications right for

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:54,200
real applications because he liked

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,390
building applications with HTML it's

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,390
like it seems kind of gross right

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,959
this is what we had the tools at the

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,980
time right like this is the stuff that

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,279
we had and real designers and engineers

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,579
like I mean they basically laughed at it

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,560
and it's because like this is the stuff

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:19,149
that they were building right I mean had

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,399
like all these really nice qualities

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,890
like is a really nice user experience it

00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,690
completely worked offline and you know

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:29,250
we come around and build stuff like

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:34,480
hotmail in 1996 which has none of that

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:36,760
has none of that stuff and yet it had

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,100
this really magical quality because it

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,930
had just a URL that's all you needed a

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:47,769
URL and web browser and you could get it

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:49,149
from anywhere and so uh 1997-1998 the

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,010
web is growing we're eight to nine years

00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,140
in this is actually another really

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,209
pivotal time this is what I think of as

00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:59,350
like the Golden Age of web standards

00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,579
when all of us knew people who didn't

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,459
really know anything about standards

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:07,390
said gee that sounds important what are

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:10,300
those and very quickly we got the first

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,339
JavaScript specification in HTML 4 CSS 2

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,220
for plain old browsers like things

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:19,240
really did get really a lot better in a

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:21,610
very short amount of time and like we're

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,410
sold right like they could have then

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,910
said anything who would have said yes

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,180
please

00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:31,540
it seemed to be so good so what they

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,510
said was XML and dumb and this also

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:39,089
seemed very reasonable and like every

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:42,670
company on the planet kind of went yes

00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:45,670
awesome but then very quickly in 1998

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:50,579
the w3 said HTML is dead

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,579
the future is XML based it's coming

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,770
another thing that happened this year is

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,720
the return of legit open source free

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:01,460
browsers so Internet Explorer is now

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,920
eating netscape's lunch and Netscape

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,760
decides to open source in fact that's

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,560
usually where we say we got that

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:13,620
specific term open source comes from

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:19,710
that and the kml browser on linux is

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:23,430
created 2006 or sorry 2001 ie6 basically

00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:26,430
wins the browser Wars 90 plus percent of

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:31,440
browsers are Internet Explorer and of

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,660
course like the HTML web is dead so they

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,140
say okay well I'm guess you're done your

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,240
job is done

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,770
you could like leave the ie6 team and

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,440
you're gonna go work on this XML future

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:45,660
Silverlight for applications at least

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,260
because like building applications with

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,000
that HTML is like grows like surely we

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,860
need something for real applications

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,600
right and like largely everybody sort of

00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,490
agreed that it would look kind of a lot

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,990
more like this but it would take on some

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,660
nice qualities that we thought we

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:09,780
learned thank you everybody

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:12,300
um so but meanwhile like developers are

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,030
just like we have tools and we're like

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,330
how can I use these tools and we're just

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:21,050
doing better and better things so we're

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,070
now halfway we're halfway to the web so

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,300
it's amazing that we got through that

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,830
half but I don't know how good let's

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,640
talk about the second half which I think

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,530
are marked by two revolutions one is

00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,090
that developers started really sharing

00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,830
they started blogging and talking about

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,490
things and sharing their thoughts and

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:45,360
then building libraries and eventually

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,910
frameworks and we begin creating names

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,580
because like this are big complex topics

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,200
now so we need marketing terms for them

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,410
and to even know what you're talking

00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,990
about

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:59,970
vaguely this is where we get web 2.0 web

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:02,380
as platform and conversely the stuff

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,790
that's happening in standards is like

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,740
I don't know like it's it's actually

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:10,540
pretty mind-boggling like and developers

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,320
begin rejecting this so you have like

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:18,370
soap wisdom bepah legacy and people

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:22,390
saying yeah just like rest or XML like

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,160
just RPC something simple and then dark

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:29,500
Rochefort comes along that same year and

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,750
says I don't know what about this and it

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,060
has the same quality as Tim's thing

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,190
which is like I kind of already exists

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,400
like he just kind of said what about

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,960
that thing right I don't know and

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:47,710
developers are like yes that's the thing

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:50,350
oh my god that's the thing what happened

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:54,880
so everything the future is XML based

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:58,060
every single thing in a w3c is XML like

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:05,950
everything and developers come along and

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:08,170
they're just like so June 2004 everyone

00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:10,030
has like plot what is going it like what

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,400
is even happening and some people are

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,720
like whoa they're working on web 3.0

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,510
that like it's a completely different

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,840
thing don't worry about it

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:22,180
so w3c actually calls a meeting in 2004

00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,150
to discuss this what is like what are we

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,050
doing what are we even doing with this

00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:31,120
and Ian Hickson from opera which was

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:35,470
also a proprietary browser it's also

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,680
called Hicks II he makes a proposal for

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:41,140
a small group of companies that says

00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,520
look all your stuff is great it's all

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,110
interesting it's actually a lot of

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,490
really good ideas in there but meanwhile

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,320
like I don't know what you call these

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,350
things that everybody is building but

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,820
there's a lot of them so like medium

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,490
applications at least medium

00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:02,130
applications seem to be a thing

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:05,710
maybe we should iterate on HTML some and

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:07,800
everybody says no no no no that's not

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,560
gonna happen

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,160
so opera Mozilla and Apple create the

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,970
what working group

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:20,400
and Hicks II sets to work in the forges

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,150
to write the new standards but he does

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,840
it he's gonna do it actually in the open

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:30,870
which is kind of a change but remember

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,970
this thing where this team no longer

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,440
exists Microsoft isn't on board they

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,330
don't even have a browser team anymore

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,520
Apple has no browser Google has no

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,650
browser and Mozilla

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,930
power is even fractured because they

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,160
have the first they were Mozilla then

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:50,490
like their their bases fractured so what

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,180
happens that old browser KHTML from 1998

00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:58,320
the open one Apple says no WebKit that's

00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:01,260
WebKit and now we have Mozilla and

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,020
WebKit to open source browsers with some

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,990
backing to implement open standards so

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,790
our Commons grows a little bit wait is

00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:13,680
Google building a browser to Google says

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:15,030
no no no but meanwhile you know life is

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,760
going on outside of these standards

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,800
bodies and we're like continuing to

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,390
write and one-up let another and trade

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:26,820
and around this time is when jQuery John

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,740
Brezza creates jQuery and very quickly

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,370
we begin to coalesce and people say that

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:36,690
is good I like that

00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:40,910
and here we get the first draft of html5

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,910
no of the parser specification

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:52,330
wait wife look at the time line just

00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,679
look at the time line we are 17 years

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,450
into the web and we don't know how to

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:01,960
parse HTML are you kidding me

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:04,510
like what surely the tests would cover

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,370
this but no there are no tests what this

00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,429
is not how we wrote standards we didn't

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:11,530
know what we were doing right so the

00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,780
browser is flexible but everybody's

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,390
browser is has an intersection of

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,470
flexibility and then like some edges

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,179
that aren't flexible

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,160
nobody has ever written this down we've

00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:22,840
never tried to fix these bugs now our

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,690
writing applications which rely on

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,240
maintaining this tree and people create

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:32,260
different trees there's this huge source

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,650
of bugs for browsers so to give you an

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,840
idea like a foreshadowing of how big a

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,320
deal people thought this was here's what

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:47,340
opera would wind up calling code naming

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,540
their new HTML parser ragnarok right

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:55,540
this I mean this is before the movie

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:58,570
right but 2007 finally w3c comes back

00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:02,320
onboard you know for medium applications

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:04,210
at least whatever those are Microsoft

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,640
comes back to the table they make ie 7

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:11,140
which was super great there was that

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,720
year is the year that we got the iPhone

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,840
which had a browser in that was an open

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,360
source browser I was amazing

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,669
and what surprised Google is making a

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,799
browser I hope I didn't ruin it and a

00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:31,840
bigger surprise is actually that their

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:33,640
browser is also WebKit so WebKit is the

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,799
lower part and you kind of snap on the

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,220
what's called the browser Chrome which

00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,049
is where they get their name and an

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,620
important difference besides of the

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:47,020
chrome is that they are going to create

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,530
their own JavaScript engine called v8

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:52,270
and it's going to be much faster

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,800
and it is totally expect compliant and

00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,480
things break why the same reason like no

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,610
but you wrote down what the actual

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,810
standard is like the one that's actually

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,660
interoperable so as it turns out like

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,280
with some hindsight and everything this

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,980
is the thing that standards bodies are

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,480
actually really good at facilitating and

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,540
it's kind of the one thing that we

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,300
weren't doing so at this point in time

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,300
we have these open browsers and these

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,450
proprietary browsers sorry I get

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,280
distracted

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:32,410
all of these are into html5 and at least

00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,700
this one has a question mark because you

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,490
know like they still have their other

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,020
things for real applications but at

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,940
least they're back at the table and then

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,010
you might have noticed this thing adobe

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,440
at the bottom that's like why I'm

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:48,490
dubious right like they don't make a

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,580
browser do they so 2008 they release

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,650
Adobe AIR you know for real applications

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,930
so this is their entry and what's

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,580
differing about their entry from all the

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,940
other entries is kind of interesting

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,800
that they actually don't say the browser

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,130
is just another application they

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,210
actually say the browser is what kid so

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,990
that was actually kind of an interesting

00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:13,900
twist and eventually these things get

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,690
unstuck and 20 years in we finally have

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,310
decided that maybe in fact this web is

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,340
not dead we're probably not going to

00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,620
replace it wholesale like this and we

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,720
begin to move forward in JavaScript to

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:32,740
get the harmony era that things start to

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:35,500
move again I don't know what's going on

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,510
here web developers are competing and

00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,490
adapting and connecting all these things

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,930
like more and more advanced than open

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,730
source it's like getting kind of

00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:52,140
mind-blowing actually 2009 Ryan Dahl

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:52,140
takes the v8 engine out and creates node

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:58,940
that was amazing so at this point html5

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,980
actually looks great I mean if you were

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,040
if you're a developer at this time you

00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,840
were like that looks really cool can I

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,300
use it and the answer is like probably

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,390
not like probably not because all of

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,520
your users are ie and I use proprietary

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,380
they're way behind and they're not

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,830
really seriously committed to getting it

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,740
so what are we gonna do this seems like

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,180
no good way to get there until

00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,660
developers solve the problem with

00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,320
polyfills and I don't know what's going

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,320
on with my images

00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,010
these developers and these open-source

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,930
projects begin to get involved

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,090
themselves with standards in a real way

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:43,300
like so that they can get into working

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,160
groups and talk to them and be in the

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:50,260
room for conversations and make sure

00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:52,180
developers have a voice and then

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,900
suddenly opera says hey you know what

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,270
we'll open source - I think that web kid

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:02,280
stuff sounds pretty good to us so we'll

00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:06,700
do that here we are look here

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:10,980
2013 and we're gonna have test now now

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,980
is the time we're one percent complete

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,450
also Google says yeah opera psych we're

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,630
not going to be a web kid anymore we're

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,250
gonna be blank now and opera says that's

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,230
what we meant we meant to say blank we

00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,920
like we meant we were gonna be blank

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,620
that's what we meant to say so privately

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,680
a lot of these people who are newly

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,090
involved in standards and some of other

00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,220
people who had been involved in

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:39,400
standards for a long time started

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,790
talking and a lot of us begin to find

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,430
common ground on a bunch of things like

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:49,950
does the same broken to you and pretty

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:52,000
much universally the answer is the yep

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,220
but doesn't it seem like a lot of these

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,840
problems are more about like how we got

00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,910
here and the fact that we didn't know

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,610
what we were doing and like how we

00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,370
approached it Ashley

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,740
shouldn't it be more evolution and

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,020
revolution like don't we need to find

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,930
ways all the successful things that we

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,000
have like they can only be successful in

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,600
retrospect all the other things that

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,940
we're competing with them didn't win so

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:24,940
we had a lot of agreement on that - well

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,130
so we began to think that maybe the

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,470
economics of web standards are actually

00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,990
incomplete that developers actually need

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,300
to play a huge role in standard of

00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,890
making and currently at that point they

00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,070
played approximately zero

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,070
role

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:46,510
so we began to think maybe we can fix

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:50,530
this maybe by 2013 published the

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,690
extensible web manifesto which lays out

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,809
like some basic principles that are like

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,450
here's how we intend to fix it or we

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,010
think you should fix it and it's

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,360
basically what it says is look there's a

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:04,600
lot of greatness buried in the web

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:08,559
platform even a VM there's even a VM

00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,210
down there already and maybe just the

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,740
way we do this isn't great and we could

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,630
do better and what we should do is

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:17,039
explain the platform

00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:21,789
it's api's and make it so that we can

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:24,309
make it malleable for developers and do

00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:27,700
it in a way that we can involve them in

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:33,549
a process and find the standards as we

00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:36,070
go the next year

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:39,159
we had the first extensible web summit

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:42,820
where the w3c technical architecture

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,900
group and browser vendors and standards

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:51,490
makers everybody came and met up to talk

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,860
was great a few months later I attended

00:27:51,490 --> 00:28:00,039
my first tee pack that's the annual

00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:01,990
meeting of all the w3c players to

00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,440
actually talk about this and advocate

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,440
for it

00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:17,359
I don't know what's happening

00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:20,119
Aereo and like argue for how the

00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,669
ecosystem should look ten years from now

00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,190
and why ten years from now because this

00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,799
is a really big ship it's basically like

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,959
every tech company and government and

00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:38,169
everything in the world so we were just

00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:38,169
saying like turn and Phegley this way so

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,619
people said no they said that can't be

00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:47,659
done and especially some things like CSS

00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:51,109
like this is just never gonna happen you

00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:56,239
can't explain all that magic but ya know

00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:58,609
we can so we did that and in the next

00:28:56,239 --> 00:29:00,769
couple of years everybody showed up the

00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:08,629
first meeting of the Houdini task force

00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:11,779
was only in 2015 and here we are right

00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:14,319
this site is a little bit old now but

00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:17,029
there are browsers actually shipping

00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,849
interoperable standards about things

00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:22,129
that they said were impossible in like

00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:24,139
within a span of like two years all the

00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:27,739
browsers are shipping some bits of that

00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:30,440
that's amazing and over the past couple

00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:34,129
of years we have so much magic exponent

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,769
exposed in so many bits like connected

00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:39,039
and exposed to you I think that's like

00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:42,049
increasingly better increasingly faster

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,699
we've created new ways to identify that

00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:45,799
experiments or experiments they're not

00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:47,899
standards and just admit it right like

00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,089
not pretend that we're saying here will

00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:52,849
be in the standard but to make clear

00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:54,709
what things are experimental and find

00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:56,299
ways for developers to seek consensus

00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,879
and champions and manage the

00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:02,929
intellectual property and everything so

00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:05,149
that's really good and we got some real

00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:07,909
thought on how we evolve the web through

00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:10,369
polyfills

00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:14,839
so basically this is really amazing

00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:17,059
progress I think and meanwhile at 2017

00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,519
something happened I don't know do you

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:22,039
know about this like this is it's pretty

00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,489
cool right I don't know like do you know

00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:27,289
about grid so grid was stuck in 2011 a

00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:29,179
lot of people know that maybe but if you

00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:32,599
didn't know that great was stuck in 2011

00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,979
it was going nowhere but well maybe a

00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,569
lot of people don't know is that that

00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:39,859
was the second try because the first one

00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:41,389
was in 2005 and when I say the second

00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:44,329
try really mean the third try because

00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:48,469
the first try was actually in 1996 right

00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:54,079
so in 2017 suddenly grid drops and like

00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:55,639
haha how well because open and I'll get

00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,879
to that in just a couple of minutes like

00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:01,279
what I mean but by the end of 2018 I

00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:05,869
think like beauty is everywhere right

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,989
like our Commons is now deep and rich

00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:12,289
and multi-layered we have open content

00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:14,419
and open data we have experiments to fix

00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:16,399
things that are wrong with our privacy

00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:20,179
things that we haven't learned yet or

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,459
figure it out and we have all these

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,519
medium applications I don't know what I

00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:27,229
mean Hugh application is but I like them

00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,879
they look like all of the things that we

00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:30,949
used to call big applications for some

00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:34,459
reason that we needed a different a

00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:36,529
different solution for we have seriously

00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:38,149
advanced the state of open source we've

00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,769
created these great foundations like the

00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:43,549
open J's Foundation which can help

00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:45,109
projects manage all that stuff and all

00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:48,259
of the standards implementation is all

00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:50,059
of them now are open which is like the

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:52,549
opposite of the way we almost started I

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:55,399
think that's great we taken down

00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:59,599
lowering the stack and made like no js'

00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:02,739
and we experiment on the top with whole

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,749
new things that are still the web new

00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:10,309
like privacy models new revenue models

00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:12,289
new networking models and even a lot of

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:16,359
those desktop apps that you all like are

00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:16,359
actually a web browser underneath

00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:23,850
a lot of to your phone apps guess what

00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:27,750
they're just web views embedded is

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,890
really really huge actually you get in

00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,289
your car and you have one of those

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,630
infotainment system thanks

00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:36,179
those are increasingly web views these

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,010
digital signs or even if you go to like

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,539
Taco Bell or Wendy's or something you

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,179
can see sign with the menu those are

00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,470
increasingly just web views

00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:45,600
point-of-sale systems increasingly web

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,700
views you go home and you turn on your

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,330
TV and you get some system that looks

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,460
like this

00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:53,850
like you can almost bet that's a web

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,409
view that's just an embedded browser so

00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,110
what's amazing about this is that now we

00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:59,690
all move forward together right lots of

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:02,370
common interests lots of common

00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,990
contributions increasing ways for you to

00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,530
be involved but even if you're not

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:10,799
involved like everybody gets the

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:13,590
benefits of having these same the same

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,010
basic technology skills that are useful

00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:22,860
everywhere and standards are really

00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:26,940
starting to click so still we can do

00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:31,159
better that takes us through 2018 but I

00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:33,059
want to close off with 2019 and beyond

00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,799
one of the things that the extents of

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,320
what manifesto says that a lot of people

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,640
miss is that the purpose is not just to

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,600
make a big system of unending JavaScript

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,490
we do want to find those high-level

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,390
standards and those better api's that

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,380
make it easier but how do we get there

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,039
that's actually really hard problem

00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,809
because the truth is we don't know yet

00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:59,190
but we have to find a way to move

00:33:54,809 --> 00:34:01,919
forward and I'm really pleased that this

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,350
year for the first time some folks at

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,500
Google have put together a proposal that

00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:10,560
in fact a few like a few possible

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,440
options I do not expect any of them to

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,960
be like just adopted in whole but it's

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,879
really positive that we can begin to see

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,889
all of the pieces that fit together and

00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:23,730
how it would work it's really

00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:27,919
interesting also we need better science

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,700
about this stuff we have created ways to

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,159
make sure that we

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,570
leave the information there where we can

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,369
tell what is being really common really

00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,419
commonly used we need better ways to do

00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:44,280
it a project I'm working on right now

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:46,589
for next month is the web almanaque with

00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,929
the HTTP archive and this year last

00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,820
month in fact for the first time they

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:57,420
collected terabytes and terabytes of

00:34:50,820 --> 00:35:00,240
data about custom element use we're

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,400
doing like increasing outreach and

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,910
iteration with like with web developers

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,250
to be involved so like how can you be

00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,609
involved huh these are good questions

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:15,060
like we have taken a bunch of we have

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,740
offered a bunch of things but it needs

00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,400
to be right for you so we're still

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,010
experimenting with a lot of those they

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,430
don't close off with the politics the

00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:28,619
politics thing like this is this is a

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:31,500
thing that we talk about in our industry

00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,720
all the time right like why as far as rx

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,400
to this instead of that like why do they

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,290
think that this javascript is more

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:43,380
important than the CSS thing or whatever

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:45,060
right we want to think about standards

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,190
as a process like this really smooth

00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,050
process where you know first an idea

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,490
comes in and we hang all about a little

00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:56,069
bit and then it goes off and everybody

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:57,900
implements it but really I'll tell you a

00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:00,089
thing that a lot of people don't talk

00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,569
about which is that's not even remotely

00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:06,329
how it goes a lot of things aren't

00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:10,589
actually stuck over silly politics this

00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:12,690
is sort of a mirage actually it's just

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:14,460
what it looks like from here really a

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,680
lot of things are stuck because of

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,640
simple organizational problems about

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,490
prioritization all of these browser

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,380
vendors are organizations that have

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,599
departments and those departments have

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,520
budgets and those departments hire

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,069
managers and the managers hire people

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,750
with special skills and at the end of

00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:36,270
every quarter they have to make a

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,700
decision here are the 12 things that we

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,140
can do and here are the people that we

00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,349
have and here are organizational

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,349
priorities

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,280
so they have kind of this problem like

00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,300
they just can't keep up right like they

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,830
just cannot possibly keep up and this is

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,940
really terrible because you only get to

00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,580
be a standard if you make it through

00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,630
everyone's organizational priorities and

00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:04,140
dysfunctions and this is worse a really

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,600
bad feedback loop because you know the

00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,440
more stuff that's coming at you the less

00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:12,060
you can take time to talk to people and

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,630
it's bad for developers because we just

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,650
perpetually sit and wait imagine if we

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,950
could fix this problem

00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:24,500
so remember grid great landed right and

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:27,660
it was amazing this is why grid landed

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:31,020
company that I work for agalya we love

00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:34,470
the Commons and it's what we work on so

00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:40,490
we implemented grid in chromium and we

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:44,160
implemented it in Safari we're a

00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:47,940
cooperative of open and free software

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,210
developers around the world and we work

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,980
on all of the open web platform things

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,890
all of it the JavaScript and rendering

00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:00,720
engines everything we work with all of

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:02,640
the standards bodies and just recently

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,300
these are things that we're working on

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,660
and like so it's not just great is what

00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm saying

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,350
like there's a lot here it's just

00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,350
everyone likes grids so hold that one up

00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:22,680
and whose last line work made it and

00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:24,540
methanol in chromium so mathematically

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,810
is like different than the rest of our

00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:30,330
projects and that it is a campaign that

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:31,650
we're doing it just funded differently

00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,720
and everything we're doing it because

00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,180
it's the right thing to do basically if

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,150
you don't know math ml math amel is the

00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,340
mark-up that lets you render math right

00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,640
men render equations and things like

00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:47,280
that and chrome is the only browser that

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,090
has does not have this implemented this

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,680
is useful in like so many pipelines and

00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,020
there are already millions and millions

00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,790
and billions of documents

00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:00,020
and yet we don't have an implementation

00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:02,270
so we're doing the implementation and I

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,310
think this is like a nice bookend to the

00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:07,550
talk actually because I I don't know I

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,710
mean I could be wrong but I think that

00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:13,480
this would be really useful if you were

00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:15,650
you know like a researcher at someplace

00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,680
doing I don't know physics research

00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:21,350
let's say and you wanted to share your

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,480
information with other researchers at

00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:27,770
some big organization where that was

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,360
important like CERN maybe so I think

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,400
basically like this is part of the

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,080
original promise of the web that we

00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,930
failed to keep it's important for the

00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:41,300
comments that we get this done so we're

00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:45,860
doing that and that's actually my last

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:48,500
slide but somehow somehow it rewound so

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,300
that's my last slide basically I think

00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,790
the future is bright and our Commons is

00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,300
awesome and it's only getting better

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,300
faster

00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:03,810
