Title: Aaron Aldrich - Distributed by Design (How to Work with a Team in 12 TZs) (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)
Publication date: 2019-11-25
Playlist: Abstractions II Raw Cuts
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

At the company I work for, everything we build is distributed; our software and our company itself; my team alone is in 12 timezones. Building distributed systems is notoriously hard, but as they say, “humans are even more difficult.” As we’ve worked to build a purposely distributed team, we’ve faced specific challenges and worked to overcome them directly. We’ve treated our distributed nature as a boon to who we are and how we work, not just a challenging fact of life to be overcome, or a bug to be dealt with.

This talk dives into the details of how our company thrives on its distributed model:

* Why we say "distributed" instead of "remote" and how that language has been key from day one.

* How have shared values held us together as a group and how have they evolved as we scale from a handful to over 1000 employees?

* What challenges we face on a daily basis being distributed

* What tools and practices we use to over come them

* How we can possibly make it work with a truly global team.

hi everybody it's officially 4:30 now so

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,389
yeah I'm gonna start talking about

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,559
distributed by design this is gonna be

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,599
mostly about the culture at elastic

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,180
we're a fully distributed company we've

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,050
got folks all over the world but I'll

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,430
talk about that a bit later so you may

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,170
not notice a little bit of trivia a

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,689
little bit of relevancy here does anyone

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,630
actually know what our logo is besides

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,560
just some weird abstract circular shape

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,010
it's not an Everlasting Gobstopper

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,739
despite what it looks like so it's it's

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,629
a cluster right so this is all design on

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,480
purpose right this cluster is clusters

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,190
as far as distribute computing are

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,239
distributed they're unstructured or at

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,039
least loosely structured and they're

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,539
diverse right each piece doesn't have to

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,210
be exactly the same as every other piece

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,340
but they still come together and work as

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,930
a whole so this is purposely chosen not

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,210
just because we build software like this

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,690
but because our teams are like this as

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,090
well so yeah I thought that was neat so

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,850
briefly why distributed systems why do

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,979
we use distributed systems at all

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,320
I think really had more Grace Hopper

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,850
puts it best when she says in Pioneer

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
days they used oxen for heavy pulling

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,040
when one ox couldn't budge a log they

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,049
didn't try to grow a larger ox right so

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
horizontal scaling is a good thing like

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,220
this is useful it has value

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,259
probably the research and development to

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,900
try and continually increase the size of

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,560
oxen would become cost prohibitive so a

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,670
lot of value in that sometimes we use

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,780
distributed systems because that's

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,600
really small up there isn't it because

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,759
latency is a thing like there's nothing

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,220
you can do to speed up light it will

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,890
take about 250 milliseconds to get from

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,100
New York to Sydney and back again that's

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,299
the cost of it and that's just like the

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,649
speed of light let alone the data

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,869
processing or anything else that has to

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,200
happen industry businesses give us some

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,549
fault tolerance right we can lose entire

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,290
regions of the world and you can still

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,479
stream movies on Netflix right

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,270
distributed gives us some some value

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,189
there there's lots that we can say about

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,630
distributed systems we can talk about

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,369
cap theorem we can talk about weather

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,750
cap theorem is still relevant or whether

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,510
it's just to start conversation

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,120
I think the gist of our complex system

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,460
conversation is that it introduces

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,200
complexity to the scenario there's

00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,230
trouble when you have to add time and

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,240
space into computing but largely I think

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,340
we agree the benefits of distributed

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,890
systems outweigh the costs

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,560
right I mean we're not deploying systems

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,050
in monolithic single mainframes anymore

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,200
were writing micro service meshes that

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,550
exist on somewhere at probably a data

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,470
center you might be able to point to

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,770
unless it's migrated because something

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,630
failed

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,070
I think we've agreed distributed is good

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,900
so do we gain the same benefits with

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:56,710
people as I said you know computers are

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,090
easy but people are difficult I don't

00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,070
really think that's fair I don't think

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,320
that's fair to what we all do every day

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,000
and I think Bridgette kromm how it's

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,860
said it best when she said massively

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,270
scalable fault tolerant distributed

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,760
systems requires significant engineering

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,560
effort to build and operate complex

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,480
socio technical systems are even more

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,330
challenging that's absolutely true so

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,440
with that introduction high abstractions

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,080
what are you to use myself I'm Aaron

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,140
Aldrich I am a developer advocate for

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,050
elastic where distributed company we're

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,430
hiring folks you can stop by our booth

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,110
why guess after this talk is the closing

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,110
keynote so probably not then but how

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,790
about tomorrow I am an organizer if you

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,070
DevOps T's Hartford I'm a host of the

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,930
elastic casts which is only marginally

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,150
relevant here but you know shameless

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,280
self-promotion you can find me on

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,780
Twitter and my slides will eventually be

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,100
updated to noticed but I got yelled at

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,570
because my slide deck was too big to

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,840
upload and then I got yelled at and my

00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:56,709
slide deck was too big to compress so

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,690
we'll figure that out later but that's

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,370
not really who I am right that's my job

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,440
the company I work for and things I do

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,560
in my free time but also father a

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,330
husband's a board gamer a bass player

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,130
mental health advocate I just love sort

00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,709
of music in general and I really like

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,480
words I love language in the meanings of

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,180
words and surrealist comedy horror

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,049
podcasts I like traveling and meeting

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,400
people I like

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,500
especially dissimilar people together in

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,960
a room to talk about some shared passion

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,490
like high abstractions were a thing I

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,110
really like this

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,699
I love these conferences because you get

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,389
so many different perspectives that you

00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,240
wouldn't have otherwise the point I'm

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,159
trying to make is I'm complex right I'm

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,780
not just this one slide person there's a

00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,699
lot of aspects to that there's a lot of

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,759
angles that go on here

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,979
but that's true of you all as well it's

00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,560
true of all of us all around the world

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,509
and the challenge is when you bring any

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,819
group of these complex individuals

00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:57,539
together in any one space under any one

00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,159
banner those edges rub right and that's

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,400
just bringing people together in the

00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:05,009
same room to talk what if you gather

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,800
those people across the globe and now

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:10,620
we've introduced latency communication

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,330
protocol mismatches operational barriers

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,310
different types of change management and

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,580
that's just like how we try to talk to

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,110
each other problems so why would we

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,120
choose distributed from the outset and

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,449
this is approximate numbers actually we

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,110
do have about 1,500 plus ish elastins in

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:29,819
41 countries around the globe so I

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,620
understand why we chose this I think

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,930
it's important to look back on history a

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,150
little bit

00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:38,699
if monuments exist as this sort of

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,169
message from the past to the present to

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,900
remind us of something that occurred in

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:46,949
the past I guess the best we have in

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,860
start-up world is github so interesting

00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:52,949
fact around February 2010

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,440
shai opens elasticsearch released it on

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,789
github as an open source project we had

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,319
that repository issues page a Google

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,520
group which I think was the mailing list

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,279
of the time in an IRC channel like

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,860
that's all that existed and from that

00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,500
more and more people joined and began

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,479
that process of working on an open

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,400
source project right and open source by

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,870
default doesn't care where you're from

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,339
right you don't have to be in the same

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,960
room to work on an open source project

00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,000
together that's sort of the great

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,400
benefit of it when the company was

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,409
founded in 2012 we have our founders

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,959
originally in Israel the Netherlands and

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:29,310
Germany just to begin with eventually

00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,010
this became Netherlands and Germany but

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,810
never

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,120
and so an interesting thought here is

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,130
who do we hire first right now that

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,720
you've got for folks that are starting

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,660
the company who's the next person you

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,830
hire would it make sense to hire an

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,830
engineer who could tackle difficult

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,520
problems probably but what we did was

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,230
hire a CFO there's a deliberate step

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,750
that if we're going to hire anyone

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,870
anywhere around the globe we have to be

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,150
able to navigate the complexities of how

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,710
do I pay someone that lives in a country

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,290
where I don't even understand what the

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,010
tax code is so that's an important

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,690
problem to solve

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,100
so CFO is the first person we hired from

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,720
the outset we knew we wanted to hire

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:16,080
people anywhere without having to worry

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:18,960
about that so the challenges here we're

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,700
hiring worldwide we could do it just to

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,650
try and get closer to our customers just

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,110
to get a really convenient like

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,850
follow-the-sun support protocol but

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,470
there are way better ways to do that

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,270
that don't involve hiring people all

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,590
over the globe in various countries some

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,050
of them being the only person in that

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,060
country that works there it is far too

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,220
challenging to manage a global workforce

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,460
to want to do that just for those

00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,000
benefits so we get what do we get out of

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:50,040
this process of creating a distributed

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,960
team a distributed company and honestly

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,210
it's this diversity it's the fact that

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,780
we can hire anyone all over the world

00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,090
with different life experiences right we

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,680
all approach problems differently when

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,510
we encounter them were affected by a

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,850
past and a present but also the

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,800
environment that we live in and the

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,590
great benefit of hiring different people

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,950
a diverse group is there any decision by

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,110
defense you're countering the groupthink

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,190
bias like that that fact that if you've

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,780
got a group of people who are really

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,980
similar you're probably going to reach a

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,290
consensus on what you should do really

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,060
quickly but if you have a group of lots

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,280
of dissimilar people it might take much

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,450
longer to reach consensus but that

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,070
decision is going to stand up to the

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,810
test of time it's already been tested by

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,919
different points of view and I'm not

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,110
gonna do what the legwork for you to

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,720
like just Google why is diversity good

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,909
for my company there are many

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,919
economic benefits as well so it's one of

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,229
those great things that not only is it

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,940
good because it can make you more

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,660
successful but it's also the right thing

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,040
to do there's a key word choice I'm

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,230
using here as well it's it should be

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,570
pointed out that I'm not using the word

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,400
remote we're not a remote company we're

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,070
not even a remote first company we're a

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,590
distributed company we say this because

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,330
there's not really an office that

00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,000
everyone is in and then a group of

00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,500
remote employees our biggest office is

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,900
in Mountain View California that's the

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,340
headquarters for the u.s. amstrad's the

00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,900
headquarters for Europe but even most of

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,790
our engineering folks that live near

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,650
there don't go into the office they work

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:23,090
from home so this is the first question

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,220
people might ask when you talk about

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,930
working from home or what you remotely

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,120
how do you know people are working and

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,820
the very simple answer is because the

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,590
work gets done right this is absolutely

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,010
true it has to start from that first

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,510
step

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,830
people have to be trusted to get the

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,510
work done and it can be proved because

00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,130
it's accomplished it doesn't matter

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,770
whether someone's sitting in an office

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,390
for eight hours a day or they work three

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,380
hours really hard in the morning and

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,820
then were like you know what that

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,860
problem took it all out of me I'm done

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,150
for today but the task still got done

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,190
they don't have to hang around for no

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:56,720
reason I think the best story about this

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,150
was it a blog post any number of years

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,840
ago now at this point on our blog we had

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,160
a support engineer named Antonio and

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,950
Antonio would always wanted to travel

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,340
Asia he lives in Europe at the time and

00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,290
so he asks his manager like hey is this

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,470
possible could I still work and then

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:17,870
travel around Asia at the same time he

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,000
said yeah that's totally possible let's

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,070
figure out how to make it happen so he

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,150
did he exchanged his hours in Europe

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,370
with someone else who covered his

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,530
support tickets at the time he actually

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,330
worked on APJ hours for this entire

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,670
process answering tickets for that

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,290
region instead of his home region which

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,150
means he got to experience not just new

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,250
work experience with customers he never

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,320
dealt with before we had to experience

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,850
new cultures he met his colleagues in

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,430
Asia at the time that he never got to

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,830
work alongside in the same room it

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,390
experiences that camaraderie

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,310
an entirely different culture and time

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,260
zone and he had to take all that

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,080
experience all these lessons learned

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,820
from broadening his scope of you know

00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,370
from Europe to Asia and then bring that

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,900
back when he came back to Europe right

00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,610
this is all brought into his work all

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,230
this experience is brought in and

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,520
everything got done everything I've done

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,720
while he was there there was no issue

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,560
with him completing the work you needed

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,380
to do and this trust needs to extend to

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,090
our team organization as well so each

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,220
team within elastic if you're

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,900
subdividing further and further largely

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,270
we're divided up by product or a

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,490
solution that we work on and those teams

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,990
get to decide how will they operate at

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,460
any given point in time do we need to do

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,380
a daily stand up do we meet once a week

00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,510
every two weeks what times then do we

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,520
have that in is that a mandatory meeting

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,620
do we do it through email all these

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,050
things are decided as makes sense for

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,300
that organization we actually we had a

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,710
separate product management organization

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,000
that got real into engineering just so

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,140
they could be that much closer to that

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,660
that group so I promise there are some

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,340
challenges global hiring is difficult

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,560
we've had a few challenge that were able

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,390
to overcome some that we just kind of

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,480
accept as a difficulty that we need to

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,250
just handle and some are daily reminders

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,610
that were a little bit different from

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,770
each other so communication is one like

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,380
just communicating on the fact like

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,750
across the globe is difficult time zones

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,080
I think are the one unsolved problem in

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,060
tech forever decision making right

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,950
consensus yet another runs like

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,400
consistent problem with distributed

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,140
systems and different cultures which is

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,850
of course the problem inherent with

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,050
diversity one of the challenges of

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,610
bringing a bunch of people with

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,990
completely different life experiences

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:31,390
together in one place so let me go

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,680
through a little bit of tools for

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,080
communication and kind of tackle these

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,090
one at a time this is largely the only

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,400
place where any specific tool matters in

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,990
any way with how we deal with it most of

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,770
the rest of the challenges are overcome

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,110
with deliberate process so for

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,610
synchronous communication it's pretty

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,830
normal we use slack for the most part

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,460
chatting over text which is sort of

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:56,020
mostly synchronous when you zoom I think

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,220
Jim is pretty ubiquitous at this point I

00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,390
don't have to explain what it is but if

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,170
you

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,670
it's video chat not unlike Skype the

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,160
great things that handles lots and lots

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,970
of folks in the same room so we assume

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,530
for everything for a serious

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,970
communication we use github especially

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,190
the engineering or but pretty much the

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,090
whole elastic organization use github to

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:20,820
track work and issues that come up and I

00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,550
think a big email today I have no idea

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,740
at this point but we have lots of emails

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,870
and that's because we need to have

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,390
record of decisions and conversations

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,470
that we have and sometimes email is just

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:36,240
the best way to do it but all that trust

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,340
come with some challenges too we have

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,080
like anyone can send to all apps and

00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,020
anyone can send to the entire dev

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,670
mailing list which is a good thing and

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,250
periodically leads to moments like this

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,480
which if you can see it in the front row

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,870
but probably not in the back so I'll go

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,550
through it then quite we had Vlad invite

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,200
the entire devil organization to use

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,340
Google Calendar he's been using it to

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,030
manage his time it's worked out really

00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,100
well which of course started a chain of

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:04,080
more emails I would also highly

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,410
recommend Google Mail and why not Google

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,120
dis qualit perhaps Azure for bonus I've

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,540
been using Google Docs it's really great

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,100
for collaboration all my friends and

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,990
family connect on Google+ and that

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,430
Google Wave thing I think that's really

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,520
gonna change how we collaborate on this

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,780
team so yeah it's it's very fun right

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,310
it's not just about the seriousness

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,720
people make mistakes and when they do

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,940
you can have fun with it it doesn't have

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,860
to be a big issue

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,360
it also means we have a pile of email

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,150
filters like you can't survive without

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,040
email filters when I first started I

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,770
expected to have like oh maybe I'll have

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,160
a welcome email a couple messages from

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:43,140
mailing lists and at the time when I

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,880
joined and I was on the full dev mailing

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,850
list I also got all the build failures

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,970
and successes and all the other chatter

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,890
so within I don't know maybe six hours

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,360
of having an email address I had 500

00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,240
email messages so yeah filters are a

00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,530
thing we also no longer send build

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,010
failures to all of dev because that was

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,010
a terrible decision

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,640
so a communication process this is

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,740
what's far more valuable in how we

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,300
communicate the tools are what works for

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,590
us I think they'll probably work for you

00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,750
I don't really know what other tools

00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:19,630
there are but the process I think is far

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:22,420
more valuable by default our group

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,610
starts open right any communication

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,710
question shouldn't start with why should

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,540
I share this but why shouldn't I share

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,490
this information with the rest of the

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,120
team or the rest of the company it's

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,550
really awesome

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,470
often their CEO might make announcements

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,960
in all that just because it's important

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,310
that everyone is welcomed into the

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,590
conversation and not marginalized out of

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,670
it right so it's not this you know

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,960
you're not allowed to be here it's

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,910
always this open chat and it's this

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,200
default open isn't just about what's

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,640
going on inside the company we also have

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,740
all our slack channels are open you can

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,560
join any team in slack and talk to them

00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,760
our team meetings all those meetings I

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,290
talked about that happen in different

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,850
ways at different times those are all

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,290
welcome for anyone else to join them so

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,460
if you want to jump in on another team's

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,560
meeting just to see how they do their

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,610
process that's totally available maybe

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,190
you have something you want to talk to

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,200
them about or email groups for every

00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,370
group so you can join dev even if you're

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,380
not on the dev team you can join the

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,880
marketing emails if you want if you want

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,750
to get all of our automated messages for

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,250
a meet-up join army that's group and

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,570
calendars write all the calendars show

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,130
up for everybody so we know what's going

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:29,890
on the second point is defaulting to you

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:33,400
distributed any meeting that we have

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:36,010
that elastic starts with a zoom channel

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,810
and a zoom invite it has to start that

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,720
way because anything that doesn't

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,460
automatically excludes part of your team

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,750
so if there's a meaning it involves in

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,610
everyone's on that call it's not

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,560
uncommon to see like five people in the

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,300
same room all in the same zoom chats

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,060
from their own laptops that's a pretty

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,710
normal thing and they'll open to the

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,880
whole company so yeah absolutely the

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:56,950
minute we we forget we're a global

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,710
company and that we're not all in the

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,420
same place is a complete failing we

00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,490
can't function is distributing we if we

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,080
don't think of that first it's really

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:08,350
often the kids are on meetings - I have

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,060
very often as I'm on it's always all day

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,290
I'm working down in my office and they

00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,130
could have come down at any time but

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,540
it's only once I

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,120
started meeting them it's like hey Dad

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,440
can I hang out down here but totally

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,140
normal totally welcome because that's

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,610
the environment that you work in that's

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,089
true of our company All Hands meetings

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:27,339
as well so with 600 some active

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,930
participants in the zoom chat this is

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,570
the CEO of the company addressing

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,370
everybody from the conflict the call

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,320
room of the Mountain View office by

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,520
himself he's not standing up in front of

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,020
everyone they're in a big meeting room

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,670
while everyone else has to remote in

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,230
it's all remote from the beginning a lot

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,030
of these meetings are also recorded so

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,250
company all hands might happen a really

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,280
convenient time for the Pacific Coast

00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:53,770
but that's probably not super useful for

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,390
folks in India and China these meetings

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,890
are recorded usually the agendas are

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,750
published ahead of time so even if

00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,400
you're not there in that moment you can

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,630
go back you still you don't miss the

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,340
meeting you can watch the recording you

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,020
can follow the agenda and still get the

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,400
same value out of it when the ones are

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,630
really important like it's super

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,980
important have these one-to-one meetings

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,390
not even just with your managers

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,520
although those are probably the most

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,860
valuable and most obvious also with

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,210
other parts of your team right you're

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,290
not in that environment where you sit

00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,480
next to each other and bump into each

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,210
other and say you know do you catch that

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,130
ludicrous display last night you have to

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,510
do that purposefully so these wonderland

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,100
meetings even with your managers aren't

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,480
just about what's happening with work

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,040
and how are you

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,330
but like hey how are your kids did you

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,580
go camping this weekend's like what

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,930
music are you into right now like oh hey

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,780
I see that in the background of your

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,190
video I love that group so it's really

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,510
cool it's all about learning who we are

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:51,040
and connecting there so time zones this

00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,470
is time zones so I wasn't lying my team

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,030
we say were the most distributed like

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,920
per capita we believe is another team

00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,900
that's technically more distributed but

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,390
they have far more people than we do so

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,360
we have 23 people in 14 countries and 12

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,830
time zones that's absolutely true I was

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,390
trying to count them all up and I lost a

00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,420
time zone or two but it doesn't really

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,750
matter we

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,360
spread is from Pacific time to Sydney

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,080
there's not much between those two that

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,250
we're missing yeah it's a real challenge

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,700
on our team so the community team

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:28,070
meetings these are the convene times

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:32,120
that have meetings oh wait this is not

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,430
one so we do meetings there opt in you

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,200
might be for Fortune of reasons a lot of

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,600
us because it's the the community team

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,280
travel wops you might be physically

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,890
unable to call into it so that's totally

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,040
fine or you might be asleep the meetings

00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,750
for me happen right now so I'm each

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,960
Coast or East Coast here that's even

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,390
better

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,950
so 10:30 a.m. is one of them and then

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,840
two weeks later it happens two in the

00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,950
morning I am not expected to be at the

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,620
two in the morning call like which is

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,970
wonderful again some teams are different

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,470
and what's good for that team is

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,120
different so our support team where they

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,130
really require everyone to be on that

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,410
call and communicate they move their

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,420
meeting through time zones and it's

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,680
gonna suck for you at some point but

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,480
it's gonna come back and it's gonna suck

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,390
for somebody else later on it's kind of

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,310
the cost of it as well but when possible

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,590
we make them opt in we make them

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,240
recorded we share the agenda it's

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,290
completely possible for you to say hey I

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,730
really wanted to mention this on the

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,740
meeting could you do that for me like

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,450
completely an acceptable way to do it or

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,160
if you can wait talk about it next time

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,330
so yeah times are difficult there's some

00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:38,980
pain points there and we have ways to

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:41,660
work around it so decisions this is a

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,720
issue they're slow they can sometimes

00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,300
drag for a long time because you start

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,830
an email thread of hey here's a

00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,240
challenge some bug that we're

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,980
encountering with elasticsearch here so

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,330
I think we should solve it someone

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,070
answer is no I don't think we should do

00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,300
this I think and you just got this long

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,890
process that's inherent with

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,770
asynchronous communication especially if

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,780
your team is in Europe the Pacific US

00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,320
coast in China like it's gonna take a

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,080
while for these to happen that's kind of

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,180
an accepted cost we have some values

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,200
that I'll get into later that try to

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,730
stem this off a little bit but yeah

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,620
decisions are gonna be slower than they

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,200
could be otherwise but all those

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,030
decisions should be documented that's

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,770
no decision is made that doesn't go

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,750
through an email at some point to say

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,950
here's the decision we made here's the

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,530
process of how we got there

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,360
sometimes that's been for code and is in

00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,070
github issues sometimes it's email if

00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,840
it's like a company or process decision

00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,390
but it's all documented somewhere that's

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,040
not like slack or zoom chat or a coffee

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,480
shop meeting like those are all

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,040
ephemeral things that do not help

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,860
communicate to people what's going on

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,420
and probably the biggest thing that

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,070
we're going to talk about here the

00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,740
problem inherence of a highly diverse

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,490
group is the different cultures they're

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,990
gonna clash

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,310
it's gonna be difficult to manage this

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,920
well the first things we think about is

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,050
hiring really carefully it's generally

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,140
and it may have changed because we've

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,790
ramped up hiring but I don't think so

00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,010
it's generally a long process to get

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,350
higher than elastic I had some

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,820
extenuating circumstances but I think I

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,950
applied in August of 2017 and I got the

00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,600
job in November I organized an entire

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,940
conference in October so that's kind of

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,330
right out but nevertheless like this did

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,620
this long process between hey we think

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,200
you might be a good fit - let's start

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:35,720
this interview process even when we're

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,010
hiring rapidly it's important that we

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,050
get buy-in on this person across the

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,370
team whether it's a peer their managers

00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,980
the higher-ups it needs to make sure

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,930
that this person not only has the skills

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,640
but that they're able to communicate

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,810
clearly that we know they're gonna be

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,550
able to ask for help when they need it

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,200
that we know that they're gonna be there

00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,610
on the Xoom call and able to talk to

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,970
people through that and that they can

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:57,560
can do all that these skills are harder

00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,780
to teach then can you write in this

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,250
particular language and so that's really

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,520
what we want to interview for when we're

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,570
looking to hire folks and we don't you

00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,820
whiteboarding because it's really hard

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:12,710
to do through zoom and also it's done so

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,330
yeah my manager once told me the worst

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,340
advice he ever got from a venture

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,950
capitalist was hire fast fire fast I

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,260
said I would much rather hire slow and

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,390
fire folks never that inherent cost with

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,420
cycle especially we're talking about a

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,160
wall on

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,230
process because they're not even in the

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,310
same room as their team totally not

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,970
worth it

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:37,710
at one point yeah I don't know I started

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,840
in November 2017 we had just about 700

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,270
folks inelastic and we're just over

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,090
1,600 now which is not quite two years

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:48,590
later so this is still true even though

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,590
we're coming through that growth process

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,780
so what I think is the main thing that

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,440
ties us together the main thing that

00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,910
helps combat the cultural diversity is

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,970
representative in our source code this

00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,890
is an actual page on our About section

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,270
so if you like go to elastic dot CIO

00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,900
click on about there's a section that

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:10,740
says source code you can read this so I

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,820
don't have to read it to you cuz you're

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,430
probably reading it while I was talking

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:17,760
anyway but the idea is these aren't

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,770
necessarily specific values these are

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,870
things that we do value some of the more

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,270
aspirational some of them are about how

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,930
we operate but all of them is about what

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,310
makes elastic elastic so wanna talk

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,080
about them a little bit so you

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,420
understand we're coming from your group

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,360
may have different values but I think

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:40,470
it's good to go through so the first one

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,550
is home and dinner I wanted to point

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,750
something out about this picture cuz I

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,740
thought it was really interesting the

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,350
first time I went through this it just

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,200
it just struck me all of these pictures

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,300
are of a different type of family and a

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,580
different group experiencing home and

00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,030
dinner what does it mean to them to be

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,110
home for dinner you've got one group

00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,330
with just two people sitting in front of

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,340
a TV you've got a rather Orthodox family

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,200
over on the right side they're all

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,750
sitting down together mother and father

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,340
and all the kids at the table you've got

00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,990
a couple of walking dogs you've got

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,550
another couple sitting at a table button

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,070
cells probably out to eat for a nice

00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,230
dinner and all of these families look

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,120
totally different this isn't something

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,040
that was pointed out it's just included

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,410
in home and dinner that we are all

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,780
diverse the diversity aspect of it isn't

00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,000
a goal or a number or an achievement we

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,700
do measure it we do work to improve

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,170
other diversity aspects what is table

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,710
stakes for us that we hire people that

00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,710
look differently

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,390
yeah so this goes on to say work-life

00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:41,059
balance is a myth I absolutely agree you

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,940
don't try to have like work friends

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:46,730
balance or life netflix balance is not a

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,760
thing like we try to find balance in our

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,799
lives and work is a part of that for

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,049
some folks I know I've got a colleague

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,539
on the community team who travels like

00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,669
probably 90% of his work time is spent

00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,649
traveling he loves it that's totally

00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,940
cool for him I need to be home

00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:04,130
periodically because I have kids that

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,769
want to know what I look like so it's

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,760
it's different for all of us and elastic

00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,700
commits that you should be able to be

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,409
home for dinner this is what my calendar

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,820
sort of looks like you'll notice all

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,830
they are pink on my screen but

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,419
everything is the same car here well the

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,029
top and bottom blocks that are sort of

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:21,919
red pinkish our times are blocked on my

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,139
calendar to say I'm not at all available

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,610
the top one is because I'm asleep and

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:27,320
the bottom one is because this is what I

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,120
need to be with my family for dinner and

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,440
this is what we do bedtimes if it's

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,649
really important I can do a meeting

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,659
you'll see I have a meeting that next

00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:37,850
Tuesday and that's because with this

00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:39,230
person who lives in Sydney so we have

00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,269
very limited time then we could actually

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:47,450
be on a call together or we're not both

00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:49,789
asleep so it works out be able to space

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:55,700
in time which I always read as space

00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:58,250
time but yeah space time the idea is

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,380
that you have the space and time to get

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,389
a break from the daily routine so this

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,889
kind of sounds very googly right you

00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:05,360
have time to work on those side projects

00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:07,070
so they don't necessarily have to be

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,870
this awesome innovative side product

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,880
that you work on maybe it's just this

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,990
proof of concept you have where hey what

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,610
if you wrote this portion of code in

00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,779
Kotlin what would that look like and you

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:19,490
can go try that it could even be a these

00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:21,980
sort of low hanging fruit bugs that are

00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,480
really minor are driving me insane I

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,889
need to just go fix them today and I

00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,730
know I have other deadlines but I really

00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:28,820
need to work on this right now

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,139
and we give the space and time to work

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,389
on what matters to you

00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,769
and with that experimentation comes the

00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:37,519
freedom to fail you're expected to have

00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:38,539
some results from your space time if we

00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,549
have some results for the

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,230
experimentation you do but the fact that

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:44,290
that product really doesn't work in

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,940
Kotlin turns out is it acceptable

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,820
results from that that's encouraged in

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,530
fact we find out where we get you know

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:55,330
what works and what doesn't this sort of

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,270
exemplifies all the complexities that

00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,280
are in US and in our systems it depends

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,480
and if you've ever been to an elastic

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,100
booth at a conference and asked us a

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,200
question like how do you do

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,960
X you almost invariably have been

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,460
answered well it depends and it's

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,370
absolutely true right people are

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,810
different systems are different we have

00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,030
all these nuances there's not

00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,620
necessarily a best practice until we

00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,970
know what the context is until we know

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,010
what we're trying to accomplish and what

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:25,300
we're trying to accomplish it with so it

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,800
depends is another key one progress and

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,980
simple perfection this is where I talked

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,570
about decision making this is what we

00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,360
use to kind of stem that long

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:36,820
decision-making process we would rather

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,220
start to make progress on something so

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,080
that we can iterate towards success then

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,310
worry about starting at the perfect

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,850
place this is exemplified a couple

00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:51,010
different ways we've had defaults right

00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:51,940
so the default settings in elastic some

00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,720
of them have been chosen rather

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,660
arbitrarily sometimes to their faults

00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,530
which has been a problem right we had

00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,960
shards right when you started up in

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:04,600
index the default number of shards was I

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,250
don't know five I guess because I don't

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,740
know five I guess that seems like a good

00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,600
place to start and these have been

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,280
long-running debates the debate on how

00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,870
many shards to start with by default I

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,850
think has existed since elasticsearch

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,690
has existed and eventually we changed it

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,930
because we want to work towards

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,910
something better that's one because one

00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,740
well actually because the number one

00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,960
problem we found was that folks had too

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,430
many shards in their systems so now we

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,050
work another way we iterate and try and

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,670
improve that and that all is part of the

00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,290
failure in resilience cycle right we

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,000
start to make progress we find out

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,500
things don't work we can iterate on that

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,800
as long as we're continuing to make

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,900
process complex systems sort of exists

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,400
degraded anyway and it's all about that

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,840
improvement it's not about perfect

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,490
functionality and this was a quote that

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,000
I thought was great from redeploy a

00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,700
conference

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,080
this is last year set out you know it's

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,820
the start of a new week start up a clean

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,070
slate remember you'll succeed this week

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,200
and Joe fail this week and both are

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,540
valuable this is absolutely something we

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,870
care about leveraging the past and our

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:13,210
lessons there for a better future also

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,530
you should check out Ari - deployed IO

00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,230
because it's an awesome conference

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,820
happening later this year - it's all

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:23,950
right you are L right okay good

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:28,330
this is another part of it Oh 102 and

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,350
slash format this is a reminder that we

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,540
all operate a little bit differently

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,520
that our communication works a little

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:38,860
bit differently in fact can you tell me

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:44,260
what a 102 refers to maybe it's a date

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:48,520
what date is it right is it January 2nd

00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,870
or is it February 1st did depends and we

00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,430
were talking about so this is something

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,390
we have to keep in mind right we all

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,860
interpret things a little bit

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,100
differently the format of our

00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,780
communications has to be clearly defined

00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,730
it's a reminder in fact that we all have

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,180
an accent no matter who we are we have

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,770
an accent to somebody there's no default

00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,790
the most obvious time this happened is

00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,800
when I was having a meeting with our

00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,970
team and I said I don't know if this

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,000
conference gives us the most bang for

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,710
our buck and my Austrian colleague just

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,400
turned his head sideways and said I have

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,400
no idea what you just said

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,320
value for the cost rate yeah it's it's

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,310
funny but you just run headlong into

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,690
these moments where you two still

00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,120
understand each other despite the fact

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,190
you're speaking the same language that

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,350
can be challenging and when it becomes a

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,050
challenge the important thing there is

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,670
to assume good intent remember that

00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:40,120
we're all working for the same company

00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:43,030
on the same team presumably towards the

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,270
same goals and so if we've had this

00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,170
moment where we clash and don't connect

00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,760
probably was a misunderstanding

00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,320
it's probably an issue of format and

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,200
accents and probably not an issue of

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,640
malicious intent so there's time you

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,110
have to work through it sometimes you

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,610
have lengthy slack messages back and

00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,810
forth

00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,770
eventually you probably end up in a zoom

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,150
chat one

00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,520
somebody so you can work it out and say

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,600
here's where I'm coming from I get where

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,210
you're coming from how do we meet

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,370
somewhere in the middle and the last and

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,140
probably the one that speaks to the

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,290
diversity aspect more directly and how

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,880
we encourage that is as you are right

00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,310
everyone here is encouraged to come to

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,140
work as they are and work the way that

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,910
makes sense to them

00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,950
this picture I think again is really

00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,690
interesting it shows someone standing up

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,510
at a standing desk someone lounging in a

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:32,920
comfortable chair with a cap it shows a

00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,960
pregnant woman in the corner sitting on

00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:39,160
an exercise ball everyone here just at

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,510
that level operates differently it's

00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,920
important to give people the freedom to

00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,570
work as they want to you rather than

00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,450
like can you fit this mold and come into

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,280
the office and behave a certain way I

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,050
think great theory to explain why this

00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,070
is valuable as spoon theories anyone

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,220
heard of this before

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,840
a few people cool so it started with

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,290
folks that experience chronic fatigue

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,240
and how to explain explain that to

00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,070
someone else right so I get a certain

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,960
number of spoons every day certain

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:07,450
actions cost spoons and what I'm out of

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,220
them I'm done right I need to rest and

00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,120
for some with chronic fatigue they might

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,770
not get as many spoons as you do per day

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,780
it's sort of been expanded to kind of

00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,250
talk about that concept different tasks

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,590
take different amount of energy from

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,120
different people for someone getting up

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,770
taking a shower every morning putting on

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,450
a full suit and going to work is totally

00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,090
normal and totally acceptable for other

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,460
people that save effort to fit that mold

00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:34,030
and to become that person and to live

00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:36,370
that in an office so we could have them

00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,960
expend their spoons doing that just

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:41,140
trying to become part of the work

00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,880
environments or we could say hey do your

00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,090
thing come as you are work as you need

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,250
to and all that energy now like at the

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,020
most selfish can be devoted back to the

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,670
company right rather than spend half

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,140
your energy just being there you can

00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,560
spend all of your energy working on the

00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:01,510
problems you have and providing us yet

00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,390
another unique perspective so humble and

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:07,230
ambitious I think this is a key factor

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:10,720
this is the last one on our value list

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,099
ambition is good right ambition is what

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,899
wants you to drive to be better wants

00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,970
you to drive to something more but it's

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:18,310
important to be humble about it as well

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,349
no one of us is more valuable than

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,659
another we can neither function well

00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,310
without our lead regional sales rep

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,340
bringing a million-dollar contract as

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,659
without our document writers all of

00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,540
these people are valuable to that

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,720
process we need all of them to be there

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,760
so it's it's common for us to be able to

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,849
challenge folks in authority as well and

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,560
have conversations with the CEO like hey

00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:43,210
I don't know if I agree with this and he

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,770
will might say well we don't have a

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,550
choice but you talk with you about it

00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,050
right that's totally acceptable I'm

00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,879
gonna stew I've talked about before a

00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,909
last ition I think this has been really

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,830
valuable to this whole culture aspect as

00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,990
well at some point we sent an email

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,730
around saying hey there's a lot of us

00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:03,270
now what do we call ourselves kind of

00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,800
like you have Googlers or Amazonians

00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,330
it's sort of a small step that seem

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,760
superficial just putting a label on it

00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,950
but it gives you an identity to belong

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,300
to together right it takes all those

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,690
differences that we have and says yeah

00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,400
but we're all the last ditions new

00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,500
employees are welcomed into that when

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,349
everyone comes a brief story about

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,050
joining the company when I started

00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:28,420
actually met our CEO Shai like at an

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,980
elastic on tour events and it was just

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,690
like oh yeah and I was excited for you

00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,470
to join like it's just hugs from the

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,460
beginning it was pretty awesome I just

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,820
looked at my clock I should look much

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,260
sooner we'll get you out the other thing

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,750
is folks when you start will flown into

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,880
X school we first started everything was

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:47,710
sort of Marvel and superhero theme so XQ

00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,320
is in fact named for Xavier school for

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,790
gifted youngsters everyone's welcomed

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
into the culture that is elastic and

00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,390
what I think is really interesting is

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,880
one of the days of this X school is

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,650
elastic swag day where not only are you

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,270
asked to wear whatever elastic swag

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,119
you've been sent in your welcome package

00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,470
but the whole company is asked hey today

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,130
is the day to wear your elastic slant

00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,540
swag

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,570
take a picture of yourself or your

00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,070
colleagues or together not like secretly

00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:16,590
taking pictures of colleagues

00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:18,840
post them to our water-cooler channel

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,490
like this is just to say hey I see you

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,210
joining us welcome welcome to the team

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,760
like we're all part of this together

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:28,230
another really important aspect is

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,430
physically being together and in fact

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,800
eating together I think there's

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,300
something special that happens with

00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,850
humans when we sit down and have a meal

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,260
together and this is important as well

00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,090
so it's not good enough just to work

00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,580
completely remote it is important to get

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,900
together in real space we have

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,110
engineering All Hands meetings usually

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,700
twice a year we used to have

00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,200
specifically a sales kickoff but now

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,610
let's become our global All Hands we're

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,520
the entire company gets together and we

00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:55,200
sort of tack everything on and there's a

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,700
support summits and other teams get

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,440
together throughout the year to see each

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,630
other in space to deal with those things

00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,150
that really are easier to do in the same

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:06,240
room and during that process it's not

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,440
just business but we have fun too

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:14,340
right the team that dances together

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:15,870
stays together cool so I'm just like I

00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,610
say the story quick and kind of get

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,680
through the end of it here but status

00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,840
checks are super important you may see

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,580
this elastic heart as a sticker on our

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,550
table and I'm gonna tell you where it

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,590
came from in August of 2016

00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,030
after a leadership meeting an email was

00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,340
sent out from Shai to the entire company

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:34,770
that simply said I heart you all I

00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,680
thought you should know

00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:40,860
and something like 140 replies later

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,050
again remember this is all at me how are

00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:46,080
this on our design team sent a reply

00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:48,660
that was the elastic heart and it became

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,280
a sticker it went on shirts and what it

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,170
did was it took all the history of this

00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,760
email all this thing that occurred and

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,290
turned it into this symbol that we could

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,060
share with each other it's a slack emoji

00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,710
and so it's a way to say to our

00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,110
colleagues hey I don't just like what

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,510
you do I elastic heart it I think that's

00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,620
really awesome

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:07,590
the other important nose this email

00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,750
chain is still going so I got an email

00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,540
yesterday that's the I heart you all

00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:15,990
email and it's just this periodic cycle

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,300
of love and like adorable gifts with

00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,950
hearts in them and it's amazing like

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,080
it's just this thing that keeps going I

00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,910
was one of the first emails I received

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,410
when I started

00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,480
the company and there's never a moment

00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,980
where I get oh and all I email and see I

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,829
heart you all and upset about it it's

00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,390
always welcome it's really awesome it's

00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:36,380
an important part about connecting as a

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:38,839
distributed company so let me try and

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,670
wrap up the value gained here is not

00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:42,559
just about scaling it's not just being

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:45,079
applying efficient work close to the

00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,579
edge because again those are sufficient

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,799
reasons for building a globally

00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:50,210
distributed organization the challenges

00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:53,030
are too big to make it worth that

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,039
outcome so the benefit here is as humans

00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,109
we carry all these experiences with us

00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,420
we're all unique we're all complex and

00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,730
approach problems differently and having

00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,430
all that insight on the same team that's

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:07,549
the value there are challenges to

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,960
overcome and the biggest thing the one

00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:12,140
thing I think that really brings it all

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,760
together that makes it work is the sense

00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,349
of community that we build right it

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,730
started with open source we build a

00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:19,460
community around our products it's

00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,680
carried into the community where we

00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,630
build part of the elastic community and

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,130
it's not something we say where our

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,359
customers are our last community or open

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,950
source people are the elastic community

00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,309
it's everyone it's all the folks that do

00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:37,789
that and all the folks that you work for

00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:41,329
the company as well so yeah I'm trying

00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,619
to cut through it so I can end here yeah

00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:44,059
the main thing everything is about

00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:45,589
making people feel welcomed about

00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:47,720
joining the community it's about

00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:49,190
supporting personal unique situations

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,829
about building human action and about

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,599
our resilience overcoming challenges

00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:55,099
it's about ambition and humility and

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,839
that we all have an accent and it's

00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,170
through space and time and all that we

00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:01,609
can be home for dinner so thank you

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,289
hopefully this was insightful for you

00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:05,530
and if you again if you want to work the

00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:10,819
elastic I'm talk at the booth

00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,819
