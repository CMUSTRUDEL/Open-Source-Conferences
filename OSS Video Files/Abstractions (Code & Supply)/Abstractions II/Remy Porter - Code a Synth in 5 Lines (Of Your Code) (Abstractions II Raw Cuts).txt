Title: Remy Porter - Code a Synth in 5 Lines (Of Your Code) (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)
Publication date: 2019-11-25
Playlist: Abstractions II
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

Inspired by XKCD's "import antigravity", this talk aims to make programming "fun again" by leveraging Python and a handful of libraries to make a programmable synthesizer in an incredibly small amount of code.

From scratch, we'll explore the basics of digital audio synthesis, dive into NumPy's "broadcasting" features, and find ways to make our computers make really weird noises, with an emphasis on how very simple, clear code can lead to surprisingly complex results.
