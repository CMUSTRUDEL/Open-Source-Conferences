first of all give a round of applause to

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,149
yourself because you all are awesome so

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:50,150
I really I think that a lot of you when

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,390
a lot of war and things happened in

00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:56,989
Afghanistan that picture or image of

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:59,420
Afghanistan being a war-torn and a war

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,719
in conflict zone sticked in your mind

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,780
and within the 18 years after the fall

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,690
of Taliban in 2001 this picture hasn't

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,300
been changed in my personal experience

00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,580
when I talk to people and I asked him

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,000
about Afghanistan I see a very shocking

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,520
face a very scary face of thinking about

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,820
it's a war zone and nothing is happening

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,500
there but today I promise if you walk in

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,450
from this room you're gonna be happy

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,310
about learning Afghanistan and what

00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,040
you're doing in Afghanistan the stories

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,890
that you've never heard in media which

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,390
I'm very upset about that so hopefully

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,579
once you walk in you have a big smile

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,759
and you will tell that story to other

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:43,490
people so just to get a little bit about

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,490
to know the room and see like who knows

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:49,070
how much of that Afghanistan how many of

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,600
you had a friend from Afghanistan or a

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:56,259
person from Afghanistan except me today

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,430
also have you ever had African food

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,710
amazing for the rest of you you're

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,990
missing a big thing in your life please

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,289
I encourage you if there's any Oskar

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,570
Western here please visit otherwise I

00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:10,100
wish if I stayed more so I could invite

00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:15,440
all of you and I cook some African food

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:19,280
for you so good um so this is the statue

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,910
of Buddha in sixth century AD Buddhist

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,760
in Afghanistan created this statue which

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,930
with a stole a widow stood and also

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,640
witnessed a lot of things in Afghanistan

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:35,159
DISA statue was a sign of unity

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,650
compassion together Ness and everyone in

00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,680
Afghanistan was embracing this statue

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:46,560
and that's Afghanistan that we were told

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,680
about the beauty of it but sadly in 2001

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,590
and March 2001 a very tragic thing

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,799
happened to desist at you

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:59,430
the Taliban bombed DISA statue they

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:03,389
ruined that symbol of unity peace and

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,819
togetherness and with that they ruined

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:10,650
of the gold and the dreams of a lot of

00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:12,840
people in Afghanistan so I think that's

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,650
like the symbol that a lot of people

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,250
think about Afghanistan the ruins the

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:25,620
things the war that never ends the

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,959
country that always is in conflict so

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,170
give you a little bit of a background of

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,660
myself and the work so this is a picture

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,030
of me and my family that little girl

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,430
with the short hair and the white outfit

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,169
it's me definitely not recognizable I

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,010
think I got that very long hair now I'm

00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:48,329
so I was born as a refugee in Iran

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,459
during the Soviet invasion to

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:54,989
Afghanistan my parents fled the war

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,090
early 80s so like a lot of refugees my

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,930
parents left everything in Afghanistan

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:03,049
they went to a country which was close

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,849
to them for finding a safe haven and

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:08,879
start life from zero they only had a

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:11,519
suitcase they kind of knew the language

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,870
but it was almost a very new country for

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,909
them to start the life I was born in a

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,880
very little city near that you are an

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,599
Afghanistan border and I grew up in a

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,620
big family

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:28,470
eight kids I'm the fifth one so I always

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,720
tell my parents are not the youngest and

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,430
I'm not the oldest so I never get the

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,680
chance to be spoiled or get the

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,680
attention as a 50

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,300
I mean you know I grew up by yourself

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,100
independent no one cares about you they

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,320
don't know like what grade you are in

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,750
the school for me actually it worked out

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,380
great because I grew up independent I

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,550
learned how to be independent and not

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:59,400
really rely on people's attention or

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:02,430
support so being been as a refugee

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,520
there's a lot of obstacles and

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,860
challenges especially now that we are

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,750
facing with all this refugee crisis

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,389
unfortunately from Syria I still in

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,800
Afghanistan I think like people

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:20,130
sometimes don't have the understanding

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,150
of what does that mean to be a refugee

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,370
and going off as a refugee people think

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,430
that refugees come to your country

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,460
because they want to still opportunity

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,960
from you not that they actually can add

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,919
value and contribute to your country and

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,930
diversification and giving you the

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,419
perspective of the other part of the

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,210
world they think you are a burden

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,520
because now you don't have a good

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,229
financial situation the people should

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,960
help you the government should help you

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,870
so there is no value in you being added

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,930
in a community so you know in my heart

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,210
country Iran one of the most challenging

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,500
problem that I faced was accessing

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,419
education we had to you as a refugee

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,310
certain provide certain papers from

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,979
government to show to school that they

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,740
could let us to go to school if we miss

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,530
that paper we wouldn't be able to go to

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,960
school and participate as one of my

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,000
siblings miss one year of Education so

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
imagine growing up you're afraid of

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,349
either I would be able to go to school

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,720
this year or not so that was my entire

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:32,990
childhood since I was fortunate enough

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,990
that I get my high school degree in Iran

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,180
beside the discriminations of being a

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,560
refugee in a hoskin tree especially with

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,260
education there's a lot of financial

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,450
burdens too especially we as a big

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,500
family there was a lot not only to feed

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,270
but also to support to go to school

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,730
but for me my inspiration was my mom she

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,580
grew up in a very wealthy family but

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,190
then when she moved to Iran she didn't

00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,200
have anything so what she did she

00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,950
learned how to stitch and make dresses

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,260
so by selling those dresses she bring

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,390
income to the family she bought as a

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,820
school supplies and she invested on the

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,370
girls education in the family send us to

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,310
the school and that's what was always

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,260
with me you shouldn't necessarily have

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,840
everything ready for you to do something

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,240
great things can start with empty hands

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:29,710
and that's what I learned from my mom

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,910
and it always stayed with me so going

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:37,150
back to Afghanistan we with Afghanistan

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,890
we moved to Afghanistan in 2002 one year

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,010
after the fall of Taliban like every

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,710
other refugee we found hope now the

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,690
Taliban left on the other hand the u.s.

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,580
invaded Afghanistan and bombed a couple

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,610
of cities but the city that I'm from

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,070
Herat it's in West Afghanistan and it's

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,320
near to Iran border so it was pretty

00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,960
fast compared to other cities and we all

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,000
said it's the time for us to go and find

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,100
hope in our own country and do something

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,229
so I remember the day that we were

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,910
moving we packed everything in a very

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:12,970
big truck and the truck went sooner than

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,830
asked to the destination and we all try

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,610
to accommodate ourselves in a very small

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,610
car it was my birthday terrible so I was

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,250
crying all day because I don't want to

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,290
leave I had a lot of friends and I was

00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,450
born there although I had roots in

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,430
Afghanistan but I thought that like

00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,650
someone stole all my hopes and dreams

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,270
and friends and I have to now leave to a

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,780
place that I've never seen in my whole

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,550
life

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,039
the only thing I saw is in the news

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:42,130
which is not nice and the pictures in my

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,320
parents photo album so the whole day and

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,950
the whole way I was crying and crying

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,390
and not sure what will happen so when we

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,220
arrived to the border in Iran and

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:56,500
Afghanistan we had to assure our IDs and

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,149
that was the first moment for me to see

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,000
the picture of Afghanistan

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:04,850
we get off of the car and it was a big

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,579
dusty land and a lot of wind's blowing

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,399
no sign of green there was just a big

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:12,890
line of people standing to pass the

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,370
border so that was the Afghanistan that

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,880
welcome to me when I put my foot

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,640
I really felt great I thought wow this

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,860
is the land that I belong to now no one

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,660
gonna discriminate me because saying oh

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,610
you're a refugee you you're like this

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,010
and everyone's the same we were all

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,980
Afghans so I was very happy and I felt

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,899
so good about that we took another car

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,800
to drive to the city

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,959
so the way was very bumpy it was on page

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,910
so it tooks like seven hours something

00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,190
to get to the city it was getting dark

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,769
and I remember I look at my dad and I

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,140
said that so when we are getting close

00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,029
to the city and my dad was like well

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,110
excuse me you are like in the middle of

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:59,990
the city by the way I'm like what

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:02,630
dislike a dark City and nothing is

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,829
happening and there were only old

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,209
lanterns outside of the shops and I

00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:12,019
wasn't like wow so like dad's

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,089
Afghanistan and that's my city so Oscar

00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,660
is growing up in Iran the infrastructure

00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,890
we're better in our place that we had

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,170
for the first time I had to take water

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,750
from well so we didn't have healthy

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,779
water pipeline and we only had three

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,040
hours electricity at night so we had to

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,740
do everything we could

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,769
using that electricity time forget about

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,160
internet or phones and things like that

00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:40,490
very very basic infrastructure so that

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,519
was what I welcomed and I wanted to do

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,430
something so beside the obstacles I was

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,560
able to go and get my bachelor in

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,390
computer science in Herat University and

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,100
later I performed well so I went to

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,750
Germany I got my masters in computer

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,329
science in Technical University of

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,480
Berlin went back to Afghanistan and

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:05,630
taught as a computer science professor

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,190
so when I saw that when I was a student

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,160
I was very vocal

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,310
I was right a social and I had a little

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,180
bit of a good English

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,560
so I could be recognized better and our

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,139
teachers were foreigners

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,459
so they're always looking for someone to

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:25,079
translate this lessons to other students

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:27,660
so one thing that I remember for my

00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:31,920
first class to teach Java programming as

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:34,829
a tutor I was expected to have about 200

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,499
people to show up in the class but less

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:40,230
than 10 people showed up in my class not

00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:43,410
really good to start but the reason was

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,439
that a lot of them were girls the boys

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,499
were like oh like how can we go to this

00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:52,350
class and learn from a girl like Java

00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:53,910
programming and she can teach us so that

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,620
was their mindset they didn't want to

00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,089
come to my class because I just I was a

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,149
girl or a female mentor so these past

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:05,910
past past and then I saw that the class

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,490
is getting more packed now we have like

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,120
a full class of 100 hundred too many

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,259
students and well I guess first of all

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,579
they recognized if they don't

00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:22,709
participate in my class they're gonna

00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:25,559
fail Java programming I really try to

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:28,110
engage everyone and include everyone and

00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:32,189
have more creativity and conversation

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,949
and that time we a symbol and a role

00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:37,350
model for other female classmates that I

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,269
had that like you should push for that

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,240
and you shouldn't be afraid because I

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:44,309
faced a lot of threats I faced a lot of

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,980
death threats a lot of threats from the

00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:49,129
colleagues community which they we're

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,769
against what I was doing and pushing for

00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:54,779
but he never stopped me and when I went

00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,029
back to Afghanistan as a professor I saw

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,889
that well nothing has changed like

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,350
that's the same situation and challenged

00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:04,110
at me when I was a student my students

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:07,230
are facing so like there should be

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,749
someone to do something and change this

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,139
and that was the time for me to think

00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:15,779
about how I can use the privilege I had

00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:21,070
to go to Germany and a study and give it

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:22,540
back to Afghanistan in my community so

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,250
i promised i'd like this is the last

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,750
slide that it's gonna be terrible about

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:31,240
afghanistan and sad um so i guess like

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,529
the world presents this number to you

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,660
always and these are true numbers

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,639
afghanistan definitely considered as the

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,370
most dangerous place for women in the

00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,100
world because of a lot of extremists and

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,829
the presence of the taliban in certain

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,810
places which they burn schools for girls

00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:53,620
and they don't allow the women to go to

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,180
school and of course you see that forty

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,190
four percent of the school age afghans

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,829
are not going to school and girls make

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,690
up 60% of them and in some places it's

00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,850
even more especially the places that

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,370
face with conflicts and war and there's

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,100
the presence of taliban is more and

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,510
there's more restricted one eight one in

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,970
eight of Afghan girl is married before

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:16,959
the age of sixteen so you can't imagine

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,120
of a teenage girl marry in that age and

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,350
it will stop the way for her to continue

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,579
her education and invest in her future

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,050
there's certainly travel and social

00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,880
restrictions again because of the

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,040
presence of the Taliban in certain part

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,380
of course your family won't allow you to

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,420
travel alone by yourself unless you have

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,610
a male companion it makes it difficult

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,310
for you to leave your hometown so it

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,620
kind of like stuck in your hometown save

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,720
a lack of safe learning environment when

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,569
I was a student there wasn't enough

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,240
place for me to hang out with my female

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:51,699
colleagues and do social works except

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,199
inside the University of an inside we

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:56,290
didn't have a safe place for ourselves

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,209
to do so so that certainly prevents you

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,060
from doing a lot of social activities as

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,470
women culture stereotypes its

00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,170
Afghanistan is a very male-dominated

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,060
culture very traditional still so they

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,260
think that of course you have to invest

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,910
on boys because the boys are

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,000
breadwinners and the girl is gonna get

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,769
marry and walk away

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,350
and of course patriarchal society early

00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,190
forced marriages so these are all the

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,560
bad and terrible numbers that we still

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:27,519
face in Afghanistan and we were thinking

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,189
how to improve that but there's a lot of

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,490
good numbers that I'm sure or not a lot

00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:33,980
of you know about that

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,130
and not the media show that so during

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,610
the Taliban regime they were there was

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,490
legal so during the Taliban regime there

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,950
were about 1 million students going to

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,180
school in a country with the population

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:52,190
of 23 million out of that 1 million

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,290
there are all boys and men with zero

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,410
female participation in a school and

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,990
workplace so can you imagine excluding a

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,380
half of the society not being socially

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,320
active during that time but after the

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,640
fall of Taliban within the 17 years with

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,250
the support of a lot of international

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,190
community 7 million students are going

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,649
to school now which out of that 2.5

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,020
million of them are girls and that

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,180
number is actually increasing because

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,649
there is now more infrastructure in

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,100
bigger cities and there is more

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,839
facilities and also like in the suburbs

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,529
they the government tries to support

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,170
that some even better numbers is that

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,870
90% of residential areas in Afghanistan

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,570
have access to telecommunication so we

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:42,589
do have fun in Afghanistan and we call

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,990
each other 23 million people have four

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,140
out of the 37 million population now

00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:51,079
which is a big number so a lot of things

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,760
happens on phone and Mobile's women

00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,890
participation in the workforce increased

00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,079
19%

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,959
Sixpoint Internet users out of 100

00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:01,850
people still so it's not a big number

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,530
but still there is a lot of the young

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:08,179
population are online and use Internet

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:11,089
and also one of the amazing thing is

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:13,270
that 10 percent or 200 million of 200

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,980
million dollars of afghanistan revenue

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,140
coming from the tech sector so tech

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,540
sector is a very young sector in

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:25,459
afghanistan but still there's a lot of

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:28,400
potential for that to grow so what i

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,620
wanted to establish code to inspire so

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,740
for that i would like to first show you

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:37,760
a video so you have a better picture of

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,929
the school and you see some beautiful

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,929
faces of the girls in Afghanistan

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,990
this

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,059
can you hear the boys

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:10,389
just like unplug it and play it sorry

00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:12,600
technical problems awesome perfect thank

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,600
you

00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,660
[Music]

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,069
[Music]

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,490
so with code to inspire the organization

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,490
that I founded it's the first computer

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,890
coding school for girls in Afghanistan I

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,920
was thinking about what should I do that

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,440
change the lives of these young women in

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,350
Afghanistan but also help them to be

00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,570
financially in a better situation and be

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,000
independent so that they can have a

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,450
voice for themselves and that was the

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,480
reason that I was thinking technology if

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,520
you had a computer an Internet you can

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,740
connect to the rest of the world without

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,570
being worried of any geographical

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,700
boundaries you're just the digital

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,410
citizen of the world and you can talk to

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,590
a lot of people and you actually can

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,420
make money being online with your skills

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,420
so that was the reason that inspired me

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,600
to do that I registered code to inspire

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,910
in January 2015 with the IndieGoGo

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,400
fundraisers that our initial goal was to

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:35,010
raise twenty thousand we raised $21,000

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,490
and we received twenty laptops in-kind

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,990
donations from overstock we were able to

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,280
open the first computer coding was cold

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,080
for girls in Afghanistan November 2015

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,600
really the idea was three things first

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,030
provide a safe and secure educational

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,280
environment for all these young women so

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,860
that they wouldn't be afraid of any

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,960
verbal sexual harassment that they will

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,390
face outside of their house and the

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,010
places that they go second we provide

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,690
the school for free so we don't charge

00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,250
the students because a lot of students

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,770
come from a very challenging financial

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,050
backgrounds that they can afford Forex

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,970
structure local activities the third

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,970
which is the most important pillar is

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,310
what to teach them what are those skills

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,830
that they can find employment for them

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,110
an employment opportunity can be doing

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,600
remote work so that within that and

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,180
using our school they can do the work so

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,800
for that we have different classes we

00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:32,090
have classes in mobile application

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,220
Android iOS game design we use unity

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,200
graphic design web development and we

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,420
recently started also a blockchain

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,600
cryptocurrency class with our students

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,030
so we really try to teach to the skills

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,890
that they can't help themselves and we

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,040
help them to find employment when we

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,810
sorry the school in 2015 it's a two-year

00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,390
after-school program and we have only

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:57,180
one location right now in Herat with

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,820
five members we had 100 applicants and

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,460
we accepted the top 50 of them the next

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,950
cohort we had about 120 applicants and

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,260
we accepted the top 80 of them the third

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,720
cohort we had about 200 applicants and

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,370
we accepted top 100 of them and right

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,200
now we are offering a graphic design

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,930
class which the applicants are more than

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,910
250 we don't have a loft space we would

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:20,100
love to have them so there's a lot of

00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,990
growth and demands within the community

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,270
especially awareness of what technology

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,940
can help these girls and young ladies to

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,740
do that

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,890
Santa consider our numbers we've served

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,040
150 students so far and then some were

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:38,490
growing up we just got the 80 new

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,460
students again for as of January 2019 a

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,980
Plus this new graphic design class we

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,350
had 50 graduates from our school last

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,030
year in different classes we've done a

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,940
lot of social impact games and mobile

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,650
apps that they're going to give you some

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,590
picture perspective about that but the

00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,780
most important part is a paid project

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,120
part in Afghanistan that we have done

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,590
and no one has accomplished or done

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,930
something like that especially with

00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,750
women because we wanted them to be

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,820
independent and also make money so we've

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,040
added a lot of clients from here and the

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,410
outsources project for them and a lot of

00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,750
girls get paid with the least amount of

00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,390
$50 to the most amount of four hundred

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,870
five hundred dollars and we are talking

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:24,210
about women and the girls that they've

00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,790
never touched a computer they've never

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,400
been online they never had phone even

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:32,820
basic phone they never had a computer at

00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,190
home now they're getting paid 300 $400

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,200
which they make actually double or

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,800
triple than the male family member

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,370
because Afghanistan average salary is

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:48,270
$150 per month so now this girl make how

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:51,370
much 300 400 and now she has a voice in

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,320
the family she can say I can decide

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,179
what's gonna happen in this family I

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,429
don't want to be a subject of forced

00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,559
marriage because the family see a value

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:02,409
in her and the things that she's

00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,929
learning I'll give you some example we

00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:06,669
had one student who came to according

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:08,950
school when she was Pence Quinn

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,690
we had the web development class for

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,570
high school students so when she was 10

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,860
grades we interviewed and we asked where

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,750
you want to come to our school like

00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,289
what's your goal she was like I want to

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:23,440
make money

00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:26,259
Oh like that's great goal so she came to

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,289
the school and she came from a very very

00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:31,240
honored privileged background and family

00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,340
that even the family couldn't afford to

00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,490
pay a couple of cents for her commute

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,299
and we sponsored her she didn't have

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,340
laptop

00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,529
we rented a laptop to her to take home

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,200
and work on the exercises and stay and

00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,120
helped her with that I mean she was also

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,740
subject of a forced marriage with tang

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,600
guard and hopefully it didn't happen

00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:53,860
because we helped her to stand on her

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:58,049
feet and support the family so she was

00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:01,720
performing amazing like a seventeen like

00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:04,240
sixteen years old a girl come with no

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,159
knowledge and no English and now she's

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,450
just learning web development so when

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,250
she graduated from our school she

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,850
graduated from high school to at the

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,860
twelfth grade and one day she texted me

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,230
on Facebook messaged me and she was like

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,059
you can't believe if I tell you

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,860
something and almost like what happening

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:25,210
and she said that I found a job I got

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,940
convinced the company that I can create

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:31,210
a website for you and they're gonna pay

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:35,710
me $200 and I'm like wow like you're

00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,659
such a badass like yeah yeah later you

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,990
can go and convince a company which

00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,700
certainly are men in Afghanistan and

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,860
tell them I want to make a website for

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,889
you and happy to business to grow and

00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,889
then give you $200 I mean like that's

00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:53,200
amazing and and she was just crying and

00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:55,120
she was like jumping and she was like

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,190
talking to me I was like I can't believe

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
that this happened to me and she called

00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,510
me you're my lucky coin which I don't

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,930
think that but like it's just a matter

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,360
of

00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,820
providing equal resources and

00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,000
opportunity we didn't do magic

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,500
we just like found people and that who

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,560
are passionate and just gave them a

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,710
platform an invoice we had when other

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,470
students also that where she was a kid

00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,880
she used to played games a lot with the

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,000
siblings and especially with brothers

00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,550
and on papers so she wanted to come to

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,560
our game design class and we asked her

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,330
like why you want to come to our game

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,960
design class what's your goal when do

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,600
you want to achieve

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,220
and she was like well I used to play

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,310
this game with my brother when I was a

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,230
kid and she showed paper and she draw

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,300
that I was like I want to create that

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,520
game and the phone and I want to play

00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,710
with them so that's my goal that I want

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,480
it's like amazing that's a great goal so

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,400
she came to our class after a couple of

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,560
months learning the basic of game design

00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,110
she took it as her project and she

00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,480
worked on that and then she created that

00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,580
game and then we talked to her and she

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,010
was like okay so what was a the reaction

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,810
of the family and she was like well I

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,150
went to the home and I told my parents

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,040
well I made a game and I showed the

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,960
phone and I played with my brother that

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,930
we used to play that game on the phone

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,810
and they were all surprised and shocked

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,030
and the face was that they couldn't

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,650
believe that the girl of the families

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,690
they're able to do something that the

00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:25,030
boy of the family is not being able to

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,080
do that so like this is amazing to see

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:31,600
that grassroot change in a community

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,120
that they think boys are able to do

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,900
everything and the girls are not good

00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:41,260
for technical or engineering and we also

00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,600
like a lot of amazing stories of one of

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,060
other our students who participated in

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,270
our mobile application class after she

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:52,600
graduated she just found a job in Iraq

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,490
is a software company and they hired her

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,580
and now she works full-time for that

00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,860
company remotely and we had also a group

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,330
of our graduate who wanted to be

00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,550
entrepreneur and create their own

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:07,390
company in start-up and they actually

00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:09,010
raised a decent amount of seed fund and

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,210
now they have that company and working

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,909
in a scam in harada and helping

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,159
other companies so these are a lot of

00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:17,809
amazing stories that like you have tons

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,210
of them but these are some of them that

00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:26,539
we see how it changed lives of the girls

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:28,460
so what I think we have done a lot of

00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:31,429
passion projects a lot so if you check

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,130
our Google Play Store and iTunes and we

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,049
have also each for the games you can see

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,330
all the projects that our students have

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,250
done because what we wanted to do we

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,250
wanted to give back to the community and

00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,740
by playing game having fun raise

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,390
awareness but educate people so one of

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,200
these passion projects called ask on

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:52,940
backpack was that the the mobile app

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,980
students say that well when we talk

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,110
about Afghanistan always people think

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,909
it's a it's a terrible country it's war

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,950
zone we want to show other faces of

00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:03,169
Afghanistan to people in the world so we

00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:05,179
want to create this app for tourism so

00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:07,549
if anyone wants to visit Afghanistan

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:09,980
they can go and see so this is the first

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:13,580
app for tourism in Afghanistan encoded

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,640
by women in Afghanistan and called

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,750
Afghan backpack so it features now it's

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,320
in the second phase of development

00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:24,500
features four main cities in Afghanistan

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,279
you can visit you can book restaurants

00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,649
hotels flights and local services that

00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:32,059
you have sightseeing places and we're in

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:34,549
a conversation with Ministry of

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,740
Information culture to be our partners

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,320
so that we can expand the app add more

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:44,600
cities but also promote it as well to

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,640
other people so when I'm gaming class

00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,260
we've done a lot of other passion

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,450
projects that's a picture I love a lot

00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,669
what's recently in one of the IT

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,299
exhibitions which I'll show a video as

00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:58,309
well so with the game certainly very a

00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:00,080
very new industry for Afghanistan

00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:03,350
there's no gaming company there's no

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,850
gaming festivals nothing and all of

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,460
these students who came to our school

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,980
were just passionate about gaming and

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,720
they wanted to make something so we've

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,779
done a lot of passion projects but one

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,299
of the particular one that really made a

00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:22,039
lot of noise within Afghanistan got very

00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:23,630
viral and outside was the game of the

00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:27,110
Afghan hero girl game

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,120
so the purpose of this game was that I

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,440
had a conversation with our students and

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,090
we're thinking about what would be the

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,970
next passion project and they're like

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:37,429
well it kind of like tired of like

00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:40,280
playing all this game that the man our

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:43,220
superhero there's no diversity there's

00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,160
no representation I don't feel that like

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,190
the resume so like how about we create a

00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,190
game that risen it to us and other women

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,590
in Afghanistan and teenage girls so they

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,630
are like well the main character gonna

00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,970
be a girl from Afghanistan we're in

00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,179
traditional outfit and she's gonna like

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,309
go through different stages fight with

00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:08,150
different enemies and achieve a goal and

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:11,179
that actually show our real life that we

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,950
fight with the challenges we have and we

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:15,169
get to the goal we want I was like

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,870
amazing I loved the idea and they really

00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:22,490
tried as you see the background they try

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:26,169
to use the the architects of the timurid

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:29,240
era in Herat which was the most

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:31,190
successful era of knowledge in

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,570
Afghanistan so the buildings and

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,669
everything in this game kind of like

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:38,600
resonate that era and time in

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:41,090
Afghanistan so funny thing is that when

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,559
we started a lot of people in our

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:47,299
Facebook page commenting like Oh girls

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,490
gaming I think they should go to the

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:52,010
kitchen and wash the dishes and they're

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,890
gonna get marry and make babies so that

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,429
was like that heartwarming comments that

00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,429
we received

00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:06,490
which like okay I think it's a good

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:10,789
amount of showing and proving something

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:13,299
so I'm so over the time we kept our work

00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:17,210
we focus we're never discouraged and

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:19,400
when this game came out a lot of those

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,520
people because I took a screenshot of

00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:27,250
those comments and I have it in a folder

00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,250
I call it haters I'm

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,060
unbelievable oh I call it haters and

00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,850
once a while when I feel upset I look at

00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,750
that further and I laugh I'm like

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:43,380
amazing these people hate us so much

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:50,590
that it gives me positive energy to do

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:53,080
well thank you so much others so I know

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:56,830
exactly who is that person I'm like I

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,200
gonna come after you one day so so they

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:00,730
I have that folder and then so we

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,760
launched it and we see all these people

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:05,950
comment and I see those people the ones

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,100
that they said that stuff and they're

00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,470
like oh that's a nice game but can you

00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,440
make the character like this I played

00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,170
that part I had a problem jumping from

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,790
that site to another side well wait do

00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,980
you think if you just do this I'm like

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,410
oh wow amazing now you're commenting and

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:28,090
asking us to make some changes it's

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,970
amazing so so really this game showed

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:34,270
these four years of the work you have

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:36,790
done with all these naysayers and what

00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:39,340
does that mean to work as a grassroot

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:42,610
and work on the community we had more

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,800
than 1,000 downloads on Google Play

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,110
Store a couple of hundred comments and a

00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,960
lot of comments are coming from men and

00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,240
all of them are just like couraging

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,460
they're like very happy they just give

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,160
constructive feedback they tell like

00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,080
please add more levels and this is all

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,930
this new life for me it was like so

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,570
shocking and it was so happy because I

00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,150
see the shift from the people who told

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,730
us go to the kitchen wash the dishes now

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,300
to playing our game and telling us can

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:15,100
you add more levels to this game so

00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:20,500
that's certainly what's the transition

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:23,920
we were talking about and we had a group

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,020
of our students with the design we also

00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,530
try to transform and encourage people

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:31,480
with our arts and design so what I was

00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:36,130
using all this messaging apps like viber

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:39,370
whatsapp telegram and any other even the

00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,450
Facebook I saw that there's also lack of

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:44,020
representation

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,650
there are stickers or emojis from Iran

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:51,130
but the Persian accent but there's not

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,860
from Afghanistan a lot of Arabic the

00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,090
stickers that I've used when like it's

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,790
each time I know you want to

00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,680
congratulate Eid I use them or when like

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,630
there's like certain occasions I use

00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,200
those of stickers but then we were

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:07,330
thinking ok how we can change that so we

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,490
teamed up with our students they

00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:11,950
sketched all these things and all of

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,840
them represent different dialects in

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,300
Afghanistan Afghanistan is very tribal

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,030
there are nine major tribes that we used

00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,400
to use their language but also their

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,500
outfit so like this first one that same

00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,930
man an iguana that girl she's from

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,560
passion and she's saying thank you very

00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:32,530
much and of course at the top the you

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,620
know that green Afghan on the National

00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:39,190
Geographic so we use her a shower that

00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:41,740
gold so we use her as well so we try to

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,140
use the symbols and the things that

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,110
resonate to people we use that we talk

00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,910
to viber and they accepted and they help

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,880
us so now we have these stickers on

00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,830
libraries whatsapp and telegram and we

00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:58,060
try to also like have them more in other

00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:01,570
platforms so now I just got to show you

00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:05,680
another quick video of our students on

00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,480
that exhibition so you can see how it is

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,240
an IT exhibition looks like in

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,180
Afghanistan but also like the feedback

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:20,480
of people

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:20,480
[Music]

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,810
[Music]

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,810
[Laughter]

00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,799
so that was like a small video of saying

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,750
how people really engage with us and we

00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:40,410
see the grassroot level so this picture

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:43,569
always like gives me her like warm

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,510
feelings in my heart because there's of

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:49,680
course a VR headset which is pretty new

00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:55,599
and you're talking about Afghanistan um

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,849
so to me as a refugee born I always try

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,359
to use the best out of what I can and I

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:04,000
what I have so I know the value of

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,849
knowledge knowledge is power

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,339
and technology is the tool for this

00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:11,559
empowerment that's what I've learned

00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:13,690
when I started learning how to code I

00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:16,599
fell I fell in love with coding because

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,819
I loved its creativity I loved its way

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:21,190
it's like puzzle you solve a problem but

00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,990
also ownership you create something that

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,630
you own it and that's a very fulfilling

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,950
feelings for you to do that something

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,380
that we've never experienced in

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:33,520
Afghanistan ownership on something that

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,130
you have it so it's been actually seven

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,839
years that I'm here in the u.s. I live

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:45,279
in Brooklyn New York and yes there's

00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:48,640
like a Brooklyn paper here so when I

00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:51,190
came to this country I was told that

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,369
there is an American dream here it's a

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:58,089
land of opportunity you come you work

00:37:54,369 --> 00:38:01,059
hard you achieve what you want and for

00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:03,849
me I always kept my askin dream with

00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:06,279
myself I appreciated all the

00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:08,380
opportunities all the great full of

00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:10,450
greatness and the things that this

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,930
country or the city particularly

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,980
provided for me and I wanted to give

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:18,670
back to my country

00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,010
so a refugee who was deprived accessing

00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:23,260
education going to school we

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:27,070
my only laptop in my Brooklyn apartment

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:29,020
I was able to raise fun and build the

00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,720
first computer coding school for girls

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,270
in Afghanistan give a voice for the

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,470
girls that who are underprivileged I

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:40,090
showed that change is possible and you

00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:42,420
necessarily shouldn't be somewhere

00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,860
physically in person to make that change

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,170
well thanks to the immigration system in

00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,420
this country I wasn't able to go back to

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:52,120
Afghanistan for seven years because if I

00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,180
go back I can't come back and I will be

00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,880
a subject of deportation so I did

00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,340
everything online from raising funds

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,890
shipping the equipment's finding the

00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,410
students finding the mentors creating

00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,230
the curriculum and I'm very grateful of

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:10,450
Technology because that actually helps

00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:12,520
me to give back to my country even

00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,010
though I'm not able to be there or help

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,730
to people in my country physically be

00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,980
there so if you see it be saying said

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,860
where there is ruin there is hope for

00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,320
great treasure it's said by Rumi it's a

00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:29,500
thirteen thirteenth century Persian poet

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,650
who is like my pet crush I love him so

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,380
much I get upset I just like go and pick

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,110
one thing and it delights my day but

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,740
this particular one always stays with me

00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:45,940
because it talks about Afghanistan a lot

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,650
it shows that the ruins you sow but

00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:51,490
there's always a hope for finding a

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:53,280
treasure and for me that ruins and the

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,650
country is Afghanistan and that

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,840
treasures are the girls in Afghanistan

00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,990
that we invest on their education to

00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:06,460
have a voice and to be independent so I

00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:09,820
always say that from the Shalit lives of

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,430
refugees and ruined nation can come

00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,640
treasure if you know where to find it

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:19,140
and for me that's Afghanistan 2.0 that

00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,140
I'm building thank you

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:30,370
