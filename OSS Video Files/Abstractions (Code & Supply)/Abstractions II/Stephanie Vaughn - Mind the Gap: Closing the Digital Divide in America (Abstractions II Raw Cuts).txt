Publication date: 2019-11-24
Playlist: Abstractions II
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

According to the FCC, in Detroit - my hometown - 40 percent of residents do not have internet access of any kind at home, while 57 percent rely on their smartphones to get online. This is not exclusive to Detroit. Major cities across America like Miami, FL, Dallas, TX, Milwaukee, WI and Newark, NJ all have a population of 40 percent or more that does not have fixed broadband internet access at home.

What challenges do people without Internet access face? What limitations do people with mobile-only Internet access encounter? As technology (and our relationship with it) continues to evolve, how can we better serve those who fall into the gaps of the Digital Divide?

In this talk, I will discuss some of the grassroots efforts in Detroit which seek to address the yawning chasm that separates those who can readily access technology and information from those who cannot. I will draw on my experiences working with nonprofit tech education organizations and programs. Together, we will see what this divide looks like and how we can help close this gap.
