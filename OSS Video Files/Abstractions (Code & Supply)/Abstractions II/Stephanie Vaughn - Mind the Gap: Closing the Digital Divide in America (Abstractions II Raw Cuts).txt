Title: Stephanie Vaughn - Mind the Gap: Closing the Digital Divide in America (Abstractions II Raw Cuts)
Publication date: 2019-11-24
Playlist: Abstractions II
Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

Interested in sponsoring professional post-production costs in exchange for your company's name and logo in the video forevermore? Contact us at sponsorship@abstractions.io. Opportunities start at $1,000.

According to the FCC, in Detroit - my hometown - 40 percent of residents do not have internet access of any kind at home, while 57 percent rely on their smartphones to get online. This is not exclusive to Detroit. Major cities across America like Miami, FL, Dallas, TX, Milwaukee, WI and Newark, NJ all have a population of 40 percent or more that does not have fixed broadband internet access at home.

What challenges do people without Internet access face? What limitations do people with mobile-only Internet access encounter? As technology (and our relationship with it) continues to evolve, how can we better serve those who fall into the gaps of the Digital Divide?

In this talk, I will discuss some of the grassroots efforts in Detroit which seek to address the yawning chasm that separates those who can readily access technology and information from those who cannot. I will draw on my experiences working with nonprofit tech education organizations and programs. Together, we will see what this divide looks like and how we can help close this gap.

doing the mind the gap closing the

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,049
digital divide in America and I for one

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,150
am very excited to see his talks I just

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,529
saw her and destroy it for self Kampf

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,050
which I highly recommend checking out as

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,000
well and she talked a bit about bias and

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,619
AI so those videos should be out soon

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,100
you should check that too so you're in

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,199

this is someone's gonna speak about what

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,920
we need to talk about in technology and

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,359
the importance of seeing all the

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,720
differences that we're not quite

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,110
accounting for in general so presenting

00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,110
[Applause]

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,890
thank you for that lovely introduction

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,469
my name is Stephanie Vaughn and if you

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,960
are here for mind the gap closing the

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,850
digital divide in America you are in the

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
right place and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:58,920
get started a little bit about me I'm a

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,449
Detroit native I am a communications

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,120
professional I have over a decade of

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,600
experience working in the media side of

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,290
communications and in 2016 I made the

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,270
career change to tech so I did a

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,729
bootcamp at Grand Circus in Detroit and

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,729
I studied front-end web development I

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,470
also have done a fellowship in software

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,600
development

00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm also very passionate about

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,060
technology and computer science

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,710
education and this past summer I was

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,189
working as a computer science instructor

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:38,600
for a stem a summer stem honors program

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,600
in Detroit so

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,259
feel free to take a cue from the

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:52,670
national treasure of the parks and

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:58,380
recreation universe Donna mEagle and

00:01:52,670 --> 00:02:01,259
this is my info you can tag me in your

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,179
tweets you can also take pictures I

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,039
dress nice today so you all can take

00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:09,690
your selfie and can everybody hear me

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,150
okay great

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,670
and so that's my Twitter and that's the

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:20,670
abstractions hashtag and I also made up

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:25,260
a hashtag so let's see if we can get it

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,420
trending and if you would like to view

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,819
the slides you can follow along that is

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:36,660
my not so short shortened link bellow I

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:40,819
mind the gap abstractions and then I do

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,819
not tweet it but I will tweet it later

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,799
so let's take a step back in time to

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,850
1996 when America Online left behind

00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:53,400
their paper our system for a flat 1995

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,829
monthly fee for dial-up internet who

00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,599
will nervous dial-up internet good times

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:04,230
right so the modern internet era has

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,109
been ushered in and you all may remember

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,940
the CDs that would be everywhere

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,530
especially if you lived in a dorm they

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,669
would just dump them in the lobby and

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,239
then people would just use them as

00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:19,470
frisbees and do all kinds of other

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,030
unsavory things with them so this is

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:26,340
going to require a little bit of

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:28,950
participation from you all there's going

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,019
to be a code that pops up so you can go

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:37,829
to pol Evie comm flash Stephanie VA you

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:43,739
160 or you can text Stephanie BAU 150 to

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:47,099
220 22333 to respond to this poll and

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,530
then the answers will pop up on this

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,560
so we'll take a couple of minutes to do

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,560
that

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,850
I hope this works oh yes

00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:26,100
okay so it looks like a lot of us

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,830
AOL was our gateway to getting online

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,870
for the majority of us it looks like so

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,130
that's not really surprising I just

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,650
thought it would be interesting to take

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,990
a poll since AOL is kind of credited

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,770
with you know bringing it bringing the

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,910
internet to like mainstream audiences

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,530
not saying that it wasn't available

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:53,229
before but it's when it became like

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:54,250
widespread and widely available so this

00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:56,440
one's gonna be a little different it's

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,410
gonna be a word cloud so when you

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,940
respond

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,000
how did having access to the Internet

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,780
for the first time change your life so

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,790
just take a minute to think about what

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,450
changed for you once you had access to

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,380
the internet like full time or you know

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:20,610
just having access to the Internet

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,610
period videos

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,400
my space yeah that was a big one

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,830
unsavory possibilities I like that

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,110
okay so it looks like the biggest words

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,870
are like kind of the most common

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,930
responses which are access email myspace

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,780
aim information so it's safe to say that

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,330
having access to the Internet opened

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,550
things up for us in terms of having

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,659
access to intermittent information at

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,750
times access to entertainment and you

00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:16,550
know just broadening the world that we

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:19,729
knew all right so it's coming back to

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,270
2019 and so there's no way around it the

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,039
Internet is everywhere you can list you

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,569
can you can't listen to it you can get

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,300
it on planes some cities have been

00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:36,469
incorporating hotspots on the street

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,300
using old pay phone booths you can even

00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:45,439
get it underground in the subway in your

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:46,639
car it's literally everywhere but I want

00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,770
you to take a minute to think if you

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,069
lost your internet access how would your

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:55,009
life be impacted given the ubiquity of

00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:58,759
the Internet you BIC WA T of the

00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:00,139
Internet as we know it now so think

00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,870
about how your left will be impacted

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,870
like positively negatively or whatever

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,580
so job is the big one we work in tech if

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,889
we didn't have internet we a lot of us

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,129
would not be able to work so that's not

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,129
surprising

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,700
another one I see is isolated and that's

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,570
true for you know especially if you live

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:37,360
somewhere where maybe you don't have

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,090
access to like a community that you

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,550
identify with and on that helps with ice

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:48,870
you know not feeling so isolated so

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:54,090
these are some interesting responses

00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,090
that I think we should take into account

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,030
so with that in mind I want to point out

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,250
that in my hometown of Detroit

00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,170
40% of Detroit residents do not have

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:13,200
internet access at home and that

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,200
includes 70% of school-aged children and

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,650
as it turns out Detroit is the second

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,760
worst connected city in the country over

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,310
140,000 households without fixed

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,840
broadband internet and 100,000

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:34,680
households have no internet at all we

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:37,419
are second after Brownsville Texas but I

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:44,159
want to point out that this Detroit does

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,159
not have a monopoly of poor connectivity

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,210
it's also important to note that when we

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,710
say fixed broadband internet we are

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:57,700
talking about wireline broadband

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:59,800
technologies and you know fixed Wi-Fi

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,100
technologies and it doesn't include 3G

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:10,720
and 4G mobile service and so this is a

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:11,530
graphic about the information that I

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
just mentioned

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:17,110
so with 40% of households in Detroit

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,480
that have no internet internet access of

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,339
any kind and the households that have no

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,360
fixed line internet access they rely on

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,190
their smartphones to get online and 70%

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,770
of Detroit schoolchildren have no

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,650
internet access at home so if any of you

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,170
have kids just think about you know how

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,540
that would affect

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:46,529
their ability to do their homework or to

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:48,300
study especially if as we're using

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,700
classrooms are using more and more

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,079
technology using tools like Google

00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:57,390
classroom to do assignments and to um

00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:03,600
you know take tests or share resources

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:07,680
and this is a graphic that illustrates

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,500
all of the I guess worst connected

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,890
cities and this is not just something

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,570
that affects rural communities because

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,630
we might think that this might be an

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,670
issue that it's primarily affecting more

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,550
rural communities but we have major

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:28,500
cities like Cleveland Ohio Miami Florida

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:34,320
and Newark New Jersey that all have 40%

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,880
or more households without internet so

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,940
like I said Detroit does not have a

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,070
monopoly on this problem this is a

00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,980
nationwide problem and it's not isolated

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:48,990
- it's not isolated to rural communities

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:51,990
or you know communities that lay out

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,899
like lie outside of urban areas these

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:59,339
are actually major metropolitan areas

00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:03,899
that have this issue and so that brings

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:07,019
us into smartphone dependency so as we

00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,029
adopt as the adoption of traditional

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,490
broadband services has slowed down in

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,829
recent years growing number of Americans

00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,860
now use smartphones as their primary

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:19,410
means of access to Internet at home and

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:26,100
one in five American adults are

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:27,779
smartphone only Internet users so this

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,940
trend is important to note because it is

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,399
strongly reflected in these 57% of

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,839
households in Detroit that solely rely

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,199
on their smartphones to access the

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:42,260
Internet

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:46,050
and this is from the pew pew research

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:49,440
they released a report in June of this

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,490
year showing that 37% of Americans go

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,370
online primarily

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,980
smartphone and they see that as a reason

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,320
to they use their smartphone so much

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:05,370
that they feel like they don't need

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:07,890
broadband internet access and here are a

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,910
couple of graphs from that same report

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:16,890
from the Pew Research Institute as you

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:18,990
can see the 18 to 29 group is the

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:22,410
largest number of group using their

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,510
smartphones to go online with 58 percent

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,290
using their smartphones only to go

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:36,510
online but overall it's at 37 percent

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:38,970
and it's there the research is showing

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:42,290
that growing number of non broadband

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,840
users are setting their smartphones as a

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:50,190
reason for not bothering to have

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,570
broadband internet at home and so I

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,030
thought that that was interesting

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:59,400
because a lot of us we use our phone as

00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,000
you know we're away from home so we use

00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,150
our phone to go online but people who

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,310
use their phone exclusively to go online

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:11,310
are feeling are increasingly feeling

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:17,340
like they don't need to have broadband

00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:18,510
internet access at home and so I want us

00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,400
to think about what does this look like

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,310
in everyday life for people within these

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,250
demographics so think about the tasks

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,660
that you do every day on your computer

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,790
trying to do them exclusively on your

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:34,380
phone in a mobile app or a mobile

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:38,760
browser so think about the overall user

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:42,630
experience with a desktop device versus

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,550
a mobile device and think about how the

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,500
devices that we have at our disposal and

00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:51,990
form both internet access and tech

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:55,110
literacy so I always like to point out

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,690
that you know having mobile devices is

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,190
great and having you know access to the

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,520
Internet through mobile devices is great

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,430
but it's very limiting in a lot of ways

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,730
because

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:09,250
you're what you can do in a mobile app

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,220
or mobile browser is limited to the

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,470
scope of what that app wants you to do

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,980
or what the company that maybe app wants

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,830
you to do and so as many of you I'm sure

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,560
have experienced you might think you can

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,060
do something in a mobile app but they

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,830
don't even bother to include that

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:31,600
feature you have to go on the website to

00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:34,930
do it and sometimes maybe you try to do

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,090
it on a mobile browser but the UI is not

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,310
great and that kind of makes it

00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:46,750
difficult to use or it's just not

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:49,480
compatible at all so also only using

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,530
mobile devices can be a limitation

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:58,510
because what if your I always use this

00:14:53,530 --> 00:15:01,390
example with my students we use Mozilla

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,010
thimble as a online text editor because

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,690
it's free and they have to create it

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,700
create an account so that they can save

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,460
their work and of course inevitably they

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,400
forget their password and so they have

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,680
to log in to reset it but a lot of them

00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,690
have never logged into Gmail on a

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,000
desktop computer so I have to walk them

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,460
through that process of logging into

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,960
their email account on a computer

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:28,600
because they've never done it before so

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:33,040
that's just one example of limitations

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,840
that come into play when you have access

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,660
to the Internet but it's only through a

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,900
smartphone it really hinders your

00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:45,190
ability to function in certain

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,080
environments and so I wanted to

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,520
highlight this quote from Diana new

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Sarah she's the director of the Detroit

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,500
Detroit community technology project

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,390
she said when you think of all of the

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,090
ways the internet affects your lives and

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,950
how 40% of people don't have that access

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,140
you can start to see how Detroit has

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,800
been stuck in this economic disparity

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,800
for such a long time

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:15,929
so I felt like that was a very powerful

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,929
quote because everything is connected so

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,799
so the big question after all of that

00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,839
very sobering data is where do we how do

00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:30,639
we even approach solutions to the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:33,189
digital divide and I will take a few

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,170
minutes to talk about some of the work

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:38,619
that I've done with various programs and

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:42,929
Detroit they're very grassroots programs

00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:46,629
that exist to address tech literacy and

00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:49,209
you know everything filling in the gaps

00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:51,879
basically so here we have the Detroit

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:53,829
Technology community project within the

00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,540
last couple of years there's been a

00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,610
growing cohort of Detroiters that

00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,619
started a movement to build the Internet

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,749
themselves and it's a coalition of

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,399
community members and multiple Detroit

00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:07,240
nonprofits and they call it the

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:10,120
equitable internet initiative and I

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,750
actually want to take a few minutes to

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:17,490
show a video a short clip from a

00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:21,839
documentary that Vice motherboard did on

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,839
the equitable internet initiatives

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,220
oh we don't have audio

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,700
okay my audio isn't working right now so

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:03,480
that's okay um it was just a little bit

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:05,430
about I'm sorry no it's okay um the

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,740
videos and the slides and you can also

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,990
look it up on YouTube it's on the Vice

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,990
motherboard YouTube channel

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,300
but that was a short documentary about

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,490
the equitable internet initiative the

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,390
digital stewardship that they started to

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:36,180
train people to build net mesh networks

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:40,450
that were tapping into unused fiber

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:42,490
basically unused fiber cables that were

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,690
left behind by telecoms companies and

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:50,230
using them to broadcast Wi-Fi signals

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:52,450
out to households in three different

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,320
neighborhoods so that they could have

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,540
access to the Internet I know that was a

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,800
very like dumb down explanation is very

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,970
it's much more complex than that but I

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:09,100
don't want it like say too much and get

00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:11,260
it wrong so also another organization

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,610
that I have been working with for two

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:18,400
years as of in October is the

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:23,620
organization called journey and they are

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:27,550
a an organization that is an advocate

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:31,120
for improving increasing Ted literacy in

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,000
Detroit so they teach workshops I'm an

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,480
instructor for them so schools who are

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,300
interested in having their students

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,450
learn coding they will hire us for us to

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,650
come into their schools to teach their

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,570
students to code there are also

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,870
after-school programs that we've worked

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:55,930
with they put on programming throughout

00:19:49,870 --> 00:20:01,270
the year so journey has a lot of I will

00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:04,960
say influence in addressing tech

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,910
literacy in Detroit and so this is a

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,680
flyer for an event that is actually

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,440
happening tomorrow they do these

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:16,570
quarterly they're called the youth tech

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:20,320
exploration and it's just a roomful of

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,840
maybe about a dozen tables and so at one

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,810
table you can learn HTML and CSS I don't

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,650
know the table you can learn scratch you

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:31,270
can learn little bits you can learn

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:38,310
digital Lego blocks not sure

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:38,310
is or that might be the the LEGO robots

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:47,020
yes and you can also run Python Ruby on

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:52,680
Rails they even teaching I guess command

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:55,060
line in version control using github so

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:58,330
these events happen quarterly and

00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:02,140
therefore youth eight to eighteen and

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:05,380
it's free so you can just show up we you

00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:08,200
know provide snacks and from you know

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:12,190
for four hours you can learn how to do

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:16,900
any of these any of these like technical

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,310
things another program that I worked

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,260
with through journey

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,830
it's called innovation huddle and it's a

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,960
stem and entrepreneurship program that

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:29,530
introduce students to STEM careers and

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,620
also taught them how to start businesses

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:36,820
so what they would do is we would use

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:39,910
the Ford steam lab model and introduce

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,220
them to stem steam careers and then

00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,960
teach them about entrepreneurship how to

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,670
start a business and then when we teach

00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,440
them how to code so that they can build

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,180
websites for their businesses and then

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,000
at the end there's like a pop-up shop

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,230
where people can come and we give them

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,940
fake money to go to all the different

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,680
shops and buy from the kids and it's

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,470
like a competition so whoever sells the

00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,020
most they get you know they get a prize

00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,480
so it's a really cool program and I have

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,330
had a lot of fun working with them

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,840
and this is a picture of some of my

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,310
students we were a couple of weeks into

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,840
the program and we were teaching them

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:18,220
how to pair program so if I don't know

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,230
if the people in the back can see this

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,300
is like a couple of students sitting and

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,970
then I have a student sitting down who's

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,740
driving and then another student who's

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,190
navigating and then on the screen they

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:33,490
have a code pen they're using code pen

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:38,800
to write some basic HTML because we just

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:42,250
taught them HTML the week before so that

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,990
is another program that I have worked

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,730
with that I'm very proud of the word

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:52,120
that I've done and book kids are great

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:55,240
so some of them are very hesitant to

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,490
approachable once they get it there all

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,440
of a sudden you know they're kind of

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,780
going beyond what we're teaching and

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,250
looking things up and like you know

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,630
figuring things out for themselves so

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,510
it's really nice to see them kind of

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,580
blossom into you know being very

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,700
skeptical of their technical abilities

00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:19,540
to you know going above and beyond what

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:21,550
we have shown them how to do and so back

00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,340
to the big question so how do we promote

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:28,590
Digital Inclusion is it a matter of

00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:31,780
pooling resources we maximizing existing

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:35,560
policies and programs if so what are

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:39,850
those policies and programs because you

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,210
know some some places might not have

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:45,310
policies and programs to address this

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:48,610
are we advocating for new policies and

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:52,960
programs because I believe advocacy is

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:55,390
very important and just even starting

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,600
this conversation of addressing the

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,030
digital divide and are we focusing on

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,490
affordability of access to digital

00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:08,530
literacy training and what does that

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:11,290
look like so the big question poses even

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,630
more big questions but I feel like this

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:17,230
is where the conversation starts so that

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:20,770
we can start to come up with solutions

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,870
to begin addressing the digital divide

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,560
because there's not one set solution

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,880
it's gonna be it's gonna have to be a

00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,080
combination of all of these things and

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,030
so how do we go about it you know what

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,540
do we attack first and how do we go

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:44,100
about approaching each of these

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:44,100
questions so that's all I have

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,460
[Applause]
