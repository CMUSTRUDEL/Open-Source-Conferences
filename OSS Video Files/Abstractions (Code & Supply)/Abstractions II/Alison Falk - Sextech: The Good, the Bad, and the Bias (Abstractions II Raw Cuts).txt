Description: 
	Presented at Abstractions II, a software conference Code & Supply in Pittsburgh, PA August 21-23, 2019. Learn more at http://www.codeandsupply.co or https://abstractions.io. 

The RAW CUTS series is comprised of selections from a few of our stages wherein the raw video was of high enough quality for C&S to release it before post-production. 

Post-production for a community-run conference with as many speakers and as low of a budget as Abstractions is an enormous and time-consuming undertaking. If you're interested in volunteering your time and CPU cycles to help with post-production, we can use your help. Email us at support@codeandsupply.co and we'll get you into the mix. You'll be permitted to credit yourself in the video pre-roll and credits and we'll thank you in this text and on social media.

When it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts. One common reason is that the media likes to focus primarily on VR porn and bang-able robots. In reality these subjects are just a small uncommon sliver on the sextech spectrum. Sextech spans everything from menopause technology and sex-ed apps for teens to teledildonics and erotica audiobooks.

You encounter it when you use an app to track your menstrual cycle, talk to an A.I. OBGYN chatbot, or simply just watch pornography.

In this talk I'll describe:

• briefly what sextech is

• the current biases sextech faces and how they detrimentally impact marginalized groups, lead to sexual abuse and stifle innovation within the industry

• why sextech is the most lucrative sector of technology based on growth statistics, use-cases and the human experience.

• why adding “tech" to the end of “sex” gives us “permission” to start dialogue on a taboo topic. The tech sector is uniquely positioned to remove the stigma surrounding one of the most common human experiences, and this is important for eliminating the professional risk associated with working in sextech. Technology enables bright minds to come forward and provide real world solutions to things like human trafficking, STIs, sexual assault, sex-ed, and more.

• why being informed on the subject will make you a more well-rounded inclusive technologist and advocate for a more diverse tech industry

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,600
wondering like what we're gonna get into

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,869

I'm gonna be going over a very high

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,690
level of all the different facets of the

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,800
spectrum of sex technology and stuff

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,930
that you should really be paying

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,820
attention to right now and how that

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,050
impacts you or maybe somebody that you

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,940
know so just want to give a quick

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,120
trigger and content warning that this

top does contain sexual language I'm

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,920
approaching it from a nonpartisan

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,780
perspective so if you are uncomfortable

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,869
at any time I will not be offended if

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,810

sex tech and I'm also a cyber security

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,570
master's candidate at George Washington

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,770
University where I apply what I'm

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,259
learning there to the field of sex

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,560
technology and as you can see here this

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,170
is my bird stinky I really love him he's

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,330

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:20,730
well as sex start content okay so Tony

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,300
maybe I'm wondering what the hell is sex

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,550
tag

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,190
who and here has heard of sex suck

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,860
before he raise your hands okay cool so

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:33,920
who and yeah I think sex tech is VR porn

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:37,550
and like sex robot brothels números okay

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,959
who in here has heard of sets of Fausta

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,780
who in here would consider themselves

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,640
the technologist

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,170
okay cool well I think if you all have a

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,450
phone and you know how to use that tech

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,980
I would consider you a technologist so

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,170
I'm really excited for you to learn more

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,819
about sex technology and become a more

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,819
well-rounded techie so about two years

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,040
ago I got into sex tech I was like

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,200
really jealous of everybody else who was

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,290
learning how to code and like have this

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,120
hobby of being able to merge like their

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,950
passions with the code that they're

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
building and like build some cool app

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,569
for like playing guitar and like I just

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,650
didn't really couldn't find a place in

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:20,760
tech and when I stumbled upon sex tech I

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,580
realized that was so passionate about

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,500
sex positivity that this was something

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,510
that I wanted to get into and advocate

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,240
for and learn more about it was where I

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,610
found my home

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,160
actually so I realized that the more I

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,720
talked about it and and like you know

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,820
with my colleagues I was a previous

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,740
software engineer downtown nobody really

00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,370
knew what it was and if they had to make

00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:46,810
assumptions it was kind of like not

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,790
really like good assumptions and people

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,770
just really thought it was VR porn and

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,330
sex robots was not a bad thing there are

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,730
a lot of components to suck suck which I

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,740
love and but everybody just really

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,090
thought that you know it just kind of

00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,040
stayed there but there's so many

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,620
solutions that are coming about from sex

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,450
technology so that is kind of one of the

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,240
quotes I got from Ryan Carson from team

00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,190
treehouse who's a good friend of mine

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,460
who again you know had some prior

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,220
assumptions about it and so I decided to

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,360
create that platform sex tech space to

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,100
kind of bridge that gap with

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,780
technologists to tell them like hey the

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,890
airport is cool too and they're going

00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,030
with other things that are really cool

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,680
about sex like that we should all know

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:29,740
about so this is the decks with online

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,620
definition of sex tech for me from my

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,650
eyes I would say sex hack is really

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:41,340
anything STEM related that helps

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,340
progress the field of human sexuality or

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,620
just kind of disrupts how we view our

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,830
bodies and get to know ourselves better

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,110
and provide solutions for things like

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,670
you know pleasure health and wellness

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,970
this is Cindy Gallup she created the

00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,480
first 2 million-dollar sex Eklund and

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,950
she argues that sex Tech is the largest

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,900
human use case in the world again

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,310
acknowledging that there are people who

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,380
do not enjoy sex or have any type of

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,560
sexual attraction the majority of people

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,990
do have sex so therefore it is the

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,150
biggest tech market in existence right

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,460
now it's currently worth thirty billion

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,260
dollars and projected to grow at 20% of

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,960
each year

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,990
Cindy Gallup started make love not porn

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,750
calm which is where anybody can

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,400
contribute on their own pornography

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,030
so if you're interested in contributing

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,030
to her platform

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:49,000
so the good impacts of sex Tech sorry

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:50,770
just let me take us up so sex stock is

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,750
impacting all of us right now whether

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,900
you realize it or not and there's lots

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,550
of good things coming out of it the

00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,140
first thing is that it's really

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,360
difficult to just like start a

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,640
conversation about sex but when we

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,530
untuck to the end of the word sex it

00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,480
gives us this permission and it gives us

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,300
this excuse to start that type of

00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,730
dialogue and from my personal experience

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,250
you know talking about sex type on

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,750
Twitter or Instagram or even just in

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,430
casual conversation again you should

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,720
always ask consent before talking about

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,940
sex because some people may be

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,050
uncomfortable but I find that people

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,120
will come up to me after a talk or just

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,100
online sending me a private message and

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,169
saying like hey like I've been dealing

00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,880
with this thing it's been such a heavy

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,290
burden on my shoulders I didn't know

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,330
where I could go and I didn't know that

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,250
it was okay that I could ask for help so

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,530
I really appreciate that like this has

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,840
given me permission to come forward and

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,460
be able to ask for help about this

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,220
subject and also provides a lot of

00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,990
solutions and resources it again is

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,240
starting to remove the stigma around

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,070
human sexuality and this kind of BS

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,260
notion that there's this professional or

00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,390
risk associated with working in the sex

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,820
injury industry like doing sex work or

00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,680
being in sucks Tech and it really allows

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,460
more bright minds to come forward

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,160
innovate on technical solutions to

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,460
things like sexual abuse or STI or

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,280
inclusive sex education I'm speaking on

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,410
sex education there are only 13 states

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,440
in the entire United States of America

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,080
that require medically accurate sex ed

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,380
and this is so important because a lot

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,360
of sex education is either fear-based or

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,620
faith-based and really just focuses on

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,640
heteronormative cisgendered

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,260
relationships typically on male pleasure

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,320
just out of curiosity has anybody

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,870
learned about the

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,930
clitoris in their sex education courses

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,150
one okay a little bit of people that's

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:57,500
cool it's good I encourage you if you

00:07:50,150 --> 00:08:01,130
haven't learned about it today it would

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,630
make the world a better place so it's

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,730
really important because there are a lot

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,280
of people that don't fit in this binary

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,500
and it's important that we have

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,320
inclusive sex education because when we

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,840
don't we create these narratives that

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,260
tell us whose bodies and whose voices

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,000
matter so when we have this medically

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,130
accurate sex education for only those

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,560
thirteen states are saying okay you know

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,930
there's only this gender binary these

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,700
people are deserving of sexual health

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,090
wellness and pleasure and everybody else

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,740
isn't and tech platforms open up the

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,450
doors to that inclusivity because they

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,530
allow people with those real-world

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:41,500
experiences to share the education and

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,090
knowledge that they have growing up

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,710
maybe with those stories and teach other

00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,170
people that it's okay to be this way

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,920
this is normal and you deserve right you

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,200
deserve pleasure

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,970
you deserve health care and then that in

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,440
turn influenced this is kind of snowball

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,870
effect that allows everybody else to

00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,290
learn about it too but there's a catch

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,020
which I will get to another thing is

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,480
open source sex technology has anyone in

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,570
here heard of the C sharp and JavaScript

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,090
framework called butt plug I oh yeah so

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,620
this was created by Kyle Lewis I really

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,900
encourage you to follow him his other

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,090
twitter handle is meta fetish so he

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,670
named this but cloud IO because butt

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,920
plug is a genderless sex toy unlike

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,500
other sex toys which are you know for

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,710
the penis or vulva everybody has a butt

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,410
so that was called butt plug IO and I

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:32,030
really like the idea behind it I got to

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,890
interview him and like talk with him for

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,650
a little bit and he told me that you

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,720
wanted to do this because you know sex

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,600
is such an intimate thing but hardware

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,560
is not you have to make hardware that is

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,210
able to be commercialized or you know we

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,190
live in a capitalist society so people

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,960
needs to make money off that so his

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,620
framework allows people who don't know

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,410
how to program

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,760
access to kind of control and manipulate

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,680
the toys that they own if they are

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,300
bluetooth-enabled so maybe if you're a

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,190
paraplegic or something and you can't

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,350
use your hands you're able to control

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,570
the toy and the vibration of the toy

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,950
using his framework and if you do like

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,930
coding you're able to create your own

00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,270
projects with it one really cool thing

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,040
was that CMU allowed Kyle an invited

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,960
Kyle to come out and have a sex tech

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,790
workshop and there there was a

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,900
computational artist in the workshop who

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,850
used some algorithm on glitch that used

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,460
facial recognition technology so for a

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,340
long distance when the face is cropped

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:32,010
essentially giving a digital kiss it

00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,840
triggered the vibrator that was

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,890
connected to his butt plug framework so

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:42,020
as the long distance digital kiss yeah

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,020
you get the idea so I provide that

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,820
computational artist is char Styles if

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,050
you are familiar with her work she's

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,580
really amazing so yeah so this framework

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,770
prioritizes accessibility which needs

00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:00,900
more attention in the sex text space so

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,580
the bat and this is this is the part of

00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,920
sex sex that is talked about but not

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,030
often categorized as sex check it's

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,260
something that I really want to share

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,510
with you because this stuff can happen

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,640
to any of us in this room because we

00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,670
does everyone in here have social media

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,630
or at least one or three pictures online

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:21,420
yeah okay so the first thing is the deep

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:24,300
fakes as anyone in here who have deep

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:28,050
fix before cool okay so this is a quick

00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,400
search on pornhub for a deep fix people

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,290
a lot of these people don't know that

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,350
their images are being used and now

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,460
defect technology is really easily

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,440
accessible and free you can pay about

00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,660
$14 on forums for people to create a

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,540
deep pic of somebody you know there's

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,610
lots of people on here who request you

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,830
pics of their co-workers I'm not going

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,820
to mention any of the forums or apps or

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,540
anything like that

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,980
but you only need a few photos to do

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,690
this now we're in the past you needed

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,070
like thousands of images of the angles

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,839
of people's faces and it's

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,639
it's really difficult because it's

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,500
silencing women and thumbs because these

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:09,160
are typically women who are victims of

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,630
deep fakes and there's a case recently

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,750
in India where there was a journalist

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,790
who wrote this article and somebody

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,130
created a deep fake of her and so all of

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,230
India was watching this this porn of her

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,670
and and and they decided that she was no

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,170
longer credible because of that

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,370
pornography and she was not able to move

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,470
on in her career

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,600
so it's silencing a lot of women and

00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,209
films in that case and then there's no

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,339
criminal recourse because I'm going to

00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:37,509
talk about susta FASTA but under the

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,550
Communications Act of to three tech

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:42,970
platforms can't be held liable for the

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:46,930
user-generated content under this case

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,560
in which porn is legal so these forms

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,449
for sharing and requesting deep fakes of

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,920
people they're thriving there's really

00:12:52,449 --> 00:13:01,029
no federal laws that are helping victims

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,130
to defend themselves against their

00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,199
perpetrators especially because nobody

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,019
knows who is making these deep fakes and

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,670
there's even photo search engines which

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:11,860
I discovered last week where you can

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,529
upload photos of the person you want to

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,160
create a deep fake of and this generator

00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:20,440
will find people who most closely match

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,540
that person's face so that you could

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,160
have the most realistic and deep fake of

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,680
the person that you're submitting and

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,190
again these depicts only cost like 14 to

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,990
50 dollars and again there's like a bias

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,399
in this because the the men who are

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,529
being interviewed who are creating these

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,269
deep fakes are so anonymous that they

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,980
only accept money through Bitcoin and

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:42,000
when asked like don't you feel that you

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:46,300
are violating people's privacy there was

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,120
there is no sympathy involved there's

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,130
also an app called deep nudes

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,959
this is an advertisement I wanted to

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,939
blur out this person's face because I

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,259
don't know if they were I mean I didn't

00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:59,889
assume I don't know if this is a real

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:02,709
person it could be AI generated photo

00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:04,149
but I just wanted to share like the

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,430
advertisement that is going on on the

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,850
internet for this app which was recently

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,700
taken

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,610
but this uses artificial intelligence

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:16,940
neural networks to deep close images

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,970
that are uploaded right now there is

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,940
currently there's not an algorithm that

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,890
does this for people who have penises so

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,260
if you were to upload an image of

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,240
somebody who was a penis owner it would

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,280
give them breasts and a vulva and then

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,650
there is NC P which stands for

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,050
non-consensual pornography and revenge

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,820
porn the other explicit images shared

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,470
without the consent of the person in the

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:48,710
photo and because internet exists across

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,720
state lines there are state laws that

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,920
make this illegal but they're so vague

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,540
so it's very hard again if somebody

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,070
shares a photo with you from here's a

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,590
photo of you from another state it's

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,910
hard to take action against that person

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,420
because the laws are different in every

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,190
state and now with young people growing

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,870
up in conjunction with social media and

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,450
technology and sharing sodas and not

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:14,690
really having that you know security

00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,480
hygiene being taught in schools it's

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,670
become development of finding out what

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,580
their sexual identity is and that's not

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,220
reflected in our law today so when a

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,740
person under the age of 18 takes a photo

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,920
of themselves and or shares that photo

00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,530
they are categorized as producing and

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,960
sharing child pornography and the case

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,970
that I found in my research at school

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,280
was the person was as young as five

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,320
years old who had access to an iPad and

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,940
so this stays with them throughout the

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,590
rest of their life because again there's

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,870
nothing that's reflecting that

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,280
development of sexual identity and with

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,740
research you know speaking with

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,360
psychologists they said this is totally

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,310
normal so it's really important that we

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,380
fight for this type of reform in our law

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,240
because children don't know any better

00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,010
and when we tell them though obviously

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,540
you know they still find a way to do it

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,900
but we need to make sure that they know

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,060
what the implications of doing that are

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,490
and then there's harmful technology

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,329
that's being created so just because you

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,209
can create technology doesn't ever

00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:18,369
you should create technology there is a

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,769
company that exists in Pittsburgh I'm

00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:23,170
not going to say the name of them but

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,540
they recently held a hackathon and use

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,309
three student labor students who are not

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,899
really familiar with the political

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:32,170
climate of the sex industry and

00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:33,399
consensual sex work and they created

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,220
this kind of facial recognition

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,679
technology that's used for policing and

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,019
none of this was really based on any

00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,709
accurate data that this would help

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:46,089
victims are sex trafficking and

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,519
typically when we use facial recognition

00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,989
technology we are really violating the

00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:51,879
privacy of people who are in the sex

00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:54,670
industry because we're not asking for

00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,739
consent if we can go and scrape websites

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,269
of their ads because some people don't

00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,679
want to be affiliated with that work and

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:00,819
they live two different lives and it's

00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,110
not okay to do that

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:06,610
so the real big issue with this is that

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,589
we create technology and we don't have

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,449
all the stakeholders at the table so

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,130
when you create tech I really hope that

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:18,010
you're thinking about everybody that

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:21,039
this technology will impact when um we

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,720
use technology to fight sex trafficking

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,449
and again I'm not saying human

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,939
trafficking because sex trafficking is

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,440
only 19 percent of all human trafficking

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,880
which is something that's typically left

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,500
out of the conversation around sex

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,600
trafficking the rest of human

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,309
trafficking is with agriculture and

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,159
manufacturing so I really hope that you

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:42,539
know that and we often conflate

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:47,019
consensual sex work with sex trafficking

00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:49,590
when we use this technology it and sex

00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:51,760
workers are taken into custody by police

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,500
25 percent of them have reported being

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,169
sexually assaulted by the offered

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,049
officers in during stings even if this

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,519
person is a victim of sex trafficking

00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:02,409
police officers will often have sex

00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,600
multiple times to completion before

00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:07,840
asking them if they are victims of sex

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,710
trafficking and if this person says that

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,389
they are consensual sex worker the

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,179
police will arrest them unless they

00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:17,830
agree to being a victim of sex

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,980
trafficking and this in turn inflates

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,130
the statistics that are provided

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:29,639
data to create the tech for human

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:32,220
trafficking when victims of sex

00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:34,139
trafficking are taken into custody about

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,389
91 percent of them do not receive any

00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:42,149
help the trafficker is not reprimanded

00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:46,769
and 91 about 91 percent are deported so

00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:49,740
now I want to talk about the bias there

00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:52,559
is so much freaking bias in sex check

00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,389
right now this leader some sex toy

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,260
companies that recently protested

00:18:54,389 --> 00:19:03,690
outside of Facebook in New York City so

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:05,850
when we talk about sexuality people with

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,220
penises need to reach orgasm in order to

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,320
procreate so their sexuality is

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,269
categorized as family planning but

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,220
people with babas don't need to reach

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,559
orgasm in order to procreate so their

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,389
sexuality is considered a vice category

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,639
and it is lumped in with gambling and

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:23,190
all this other illegal stuff that's

00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:24,809
happening on the internet so it's really

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,029
difficult for people to advertise so

00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:28,919
this with a campaign called approved not

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:31,710
not approved calm which was started by

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,740
game products and on thumb babes as

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:37,380
anybody familiar with those companies so

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,029
they are sex toy companies these are ads

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,220
that were approved on Facebook and

00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,409
Instagram if you can see here I mean I'm

00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,320
sure you can kind of guess what all of

00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:49,260
these images imply they are for people

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,080
with penises they are phallic-shaped des

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,380
Dames who are down to down to [ __ ] and

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,440
this ad says say goodbye to nicks and

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:01,309
snags little shaving your balls I just

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,309
kind of want to see it

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:12,100
and neither adds that weren't approved

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,990
so you can see this is a sex toy there

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,380
is some type of sexual connotation in

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:19,000
the in the captions but it's not a

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,580
phallic image at all

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,800
this is absolutely has like nothing

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,240
really to do with sexuality and this is

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,650
just a whole other issue where Instagram

00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,480
for this magazine in particular is

00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,190
really silencing the bodies of fat

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,400
people queer people black people

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,260
indigenous people people of color and so

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,540
they are labeling these bodies as

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,990
escorts when there's nothing sexual

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,570
about the photo at all and if you want

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,370
to go to this website this is a game you

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,870
can play you can guess if the ad was

00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,370
approved or not approved and it's

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:55,480
educational so I really encourage you to

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:59,410
go there when you have time next is

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,530
payment processors so when we talk about

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,410
sex Tech and all of us in this room who

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,970
use technology on the daily we can't

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,250
take it for granted without paying

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,370
homage to sex workers and the sex

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,050
industry because as early as 1980s when

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,000
the first images on the internet we were

00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,800
able to be exchanged can anyone guess

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,850
what it was well it's right there it's

00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,740
poor it was porn so even with online

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,060
payment processors like PayPal sex

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,740
workers were the first people to make

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,990
this stuff mainstream so it's really

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,790
important to recognize where this is all

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,610
coming from and how you're able to like

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,950
be able to use this product today now

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,660
sex workers people and sex talk and

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,970
people in the sex industry as a whole

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,620
are being kicked off of payment

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:47,350
processors because they're considered a

00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:51,910
liability has anybody in here been

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:55,120
shadow banned before three people four

00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:58,270
people so shadow banning is when your

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,300
content is hidden or demoted without

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:04,390
your knowledge I have been shadow bands

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,860
I couldn't find myself on the internet

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,460
there's other people who can't find me

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,540
on the Internet

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,850
and I can't find my friends on the

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,960
internet because when we're talking

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,700
about sex

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,310
I guess this trick or something in the

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,000
algorithm which I will show here this is

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,280
how it works

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,040
this is Facebook's patent which was

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,940
recently granted last month to allow

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,080
them it's just I mean now whenever we

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,610
originally asked about shadow banning

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,440
all tech platforms originally denied

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:34,390
that it was a thing but now there's a

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:37,900
patent to prove that it does exist so

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,450
now I want to talk about cesta FASTA so

00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,700
originally about a third of you raised

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,530
your hands you knew sister foster who in

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:52,690
this room knows what gdpr is okay mostly

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:56,890
everyone so my take is if you know gdpr

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,200
you should know Festa FAFSA FAFSA FAFSA

00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,330
stands for stop and abling sex

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,540
traffickers Act and allow States and

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,760
victims to fight online sex chaski okay

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,500
so just like off the top anybody who

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,910
sounds like or who claims that they

00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,950
would be against this law it sound like

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,680
a complete [ __ ] right because nobody

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,120
is for sex trafficking but this is just

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,470
created under a whole guys morality

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,380
because that has absolutely nothing to

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,300
do with what the law actually is so such

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,300
that that does not punish traffickers it

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,630
actually punishes websites instead and I

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,120
have some Intel that this was written by

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:34,090
an executive at Pokemon allegedly so I

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,510
can't actually say that it was but give

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,730
it or take of how you want so this is

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,650
for anything that's knowingly to assist

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,660
facilitate or support sex trafficking so

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,120
this is posting a picture of a condom or

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,400
talking about sex education there's so

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,840
many companies and people who are being

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,150
kicked off tech platforms who are

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,390
legitimate companies but the downside is

00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,610
that all these people have these large

00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,280
followings to support them to post about

00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,350
them and ask Facebook or Instagram to

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,520
reinstate their accounts but we have to

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,700
talk about the people who don't have

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,070
those followings people who rely on

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,510
social media to either vet clients and

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,640
rely on it for income in their

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,070
livelihoods because people who are being

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,020
kicked off of these platforms who do sex

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,690
work or do sex talk

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,820
being sent back out on the streets works

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,220
even more dangerous and because of

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,690
festive hosta websites like Backpage and

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:30,430
Craigslist where all these ads were

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:33,460
originally existing have been taken down

00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,380
so now about pushes sex trafficking even

00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,420
further underground and it's even harder

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,560
to find victims of sex trafficking so in

00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:45,970
turn it really really really hurts

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:48,550
everybody as a whole this law was really

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,180
based on more of a moral panic and moral

00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,980
high-ground

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,110
the data source for this was the

00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,210
National Human Trafficking hotline and

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,280
there was a spike in the hotline because

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,930
at that same time there is a campaign to

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,580
really encourage people to look out for

00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,070
people who they might think be victims

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,750
of sex trafficking and call it in so it

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:09,330
was really put a really poor source of

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:12,160
data and it was really lobbied by this

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,230
organization who was originally called

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,000
morality in the media which tried to get

00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:23,860
rid of porn entirely and I know 70% of

00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,080
people ages 13 to I think 48 watch porn

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,150
so at least 70% of you in this room

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,510
watch porn so you can't say anything

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,510
about that

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,560
that's a FAFSA is a security issue

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,210
because it hurts the most vulnerable in

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,770
our community a lot of the times you're

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,080
talking about women when we talk about

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,150
cesta FASTA and sex work but these

00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,520
people are already like we know these

00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,990
people exist and they have a large

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,960
support system but so it's really

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,850
important that we also focus on sex for

00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,860
earth-size esta fossa hurting

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:58,540
communities of gender queer folks trans

00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:00,220
folks and people of color so my take on

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,260
all of this based on all of my research

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:06,790
is that the root of this entire problem

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,920
was tech is education again it goes back

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,430
to us not receiving inclusive and proper

00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,840
sex education because that in turn

00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,580
that's where we created laws based on

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,140
our knowledge based on the people in

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,740
power and then that in turn influences

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,690
the medium tech those laws influence who

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,320
receives inclusive sex education and

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,090
where we get accurate sex education

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,919
because esta Fossen is now limiting the

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,139
education and shadow banning people who

00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:37,570
use words like trans or people who use

00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:39,769
words like inclusive sex ed on YouTube

00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,289
and this is just a quick screenshot I

00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:45,470
took in April and I searched sex Tech

00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:47,059
there is nothing really about any of the

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,789
stuff that I talked about today which is

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:52,549
really terrifying for me I think it's

00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:54,440
really important that we tried to reform

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:57,710
inclusive sex education especially for

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,759
future generations and children again

00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,909
because they're growing up in

00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,440
conjunction with technology I don't want

00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:06,049
it to be oh you need to teach children

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,999
about how to have sex at the age of five

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:10,519
that's not what I want I want children

00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:12,019
to know about their bodies and because I

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,999
feel that when we are informed about our

00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:16,249
our bodies we don't allow other people

00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,350
to make decisions about our bodies for

00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:19,909
us I'm not so important due to the

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,360
increase of predatory behavior on the

00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:22,360
Internet

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:29,600
so this was I'm not sure if you're

00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,460
familiar tax payers money doesn't fund

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,350
penis pumps anymore but it used to

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,149
through Medicare with no shame if you

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,679
need to use a penis pump I just thought

00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:39,830
it was kind of ironic because there's

00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,970
nothing on there about sexual pleasure

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,279
for all of us and this is just you know

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:49,820
I was just kind of shocked that I found

00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,320
this on the Medicare I just hit the blog

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,789
post on Medicare I suppose it's kind of

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,289
interesting and it's kind of another

00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:58,549
double ser and bias that I wanted to

00:27:54,289 --> 00:28:00,799
share with you so what I'm doing now

00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:02,389
besides the women of sex tech and

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,249
speaking gigs and stuff like that is I

00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,259
created an online platform called sex

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,940
tech space where it provides resources

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:10,309
on all of the stuff that I talked about

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,549
today the research that currently exists

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,490
is just kind of sex tech 101 sex toy

00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:19,159
engineering security information

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,019
security and sex tech and susta FAFSA

00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,580
and these are really important for me

00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,200
because these are straight from this

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,789
source there's no third party that's

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,590
involved in helping me to create these

00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:32,570
these are from real people and real

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:36,470
lived experiences so what can you do

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,929
today to help sex tech and help the

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,230
people who are most vulnerable is

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:42,630
support organizations like

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,600
de creme and Y and de creme now DC which

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,240
want to decriminalize sex work and also

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,669
Barzani who is really doing a lot of

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,540
amazing work to help advocate for

00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:56,130
victims of deep fakes deep porn and

00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,140
revenge porn if you are a victim of

00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,360
revenge porn or if you are a victim of

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,679
sextortion I really encourage you to

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,260
reach out to them because they help

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,120
victims for free also other

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,590
technologists use your platform to

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,140
spread awareness because this affects

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,049
all of us in this room anybody can

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,090
become a victim of this advocate for

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:17,640
agency and consent especially if you

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,679
have children teach them early and make

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,900
sure that all stakeholders are involved

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,910
whenever you're creating new technology

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,290
use your voice to speak up speak up for

00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,130
people who are less vulnerable and you

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:30,900
are more vulnerable than you and this is

00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,730
one of my favorite quotes because we

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,260
often talk about diversity inclusion in

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,940
terms of race and gender but it's also

00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,690
too important it's important to

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,299
acknowledge that this also deals with

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,100
business and industry so it could sex

00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,780
tag know that it's about a technical

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,470
field know but it's not going anywhere

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,320
and I will make sure that it doesn't so

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,420
thank you

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,420
