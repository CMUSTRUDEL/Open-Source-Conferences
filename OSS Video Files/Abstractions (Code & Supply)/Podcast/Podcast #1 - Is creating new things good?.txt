Justin’s Pre-show Notes
Code of Ages
almost a competition between companies to create new languages
languages like ruby, created by a person for fun that made it big? can’t think of any others? clojure? python is so different from its origin story
new languages highly tailored to company. should they make it to the public?
designed by Google to help solve Google’s problems
instead of addressing problems in python
“You have to ask: Is it better than what we have?”
Swift was created because Objective-C was terrible - programmer happiness goal
article doesn’t really have argument against swift being created, just how it was handled (open source vs closed)
Erlang, Java, FORTRAN, COBOL, C# many more come from businesses wanting their own language. Help shape the next language.
Why isn’t there 1 language that we’re all helping to shape?

Don’t tell me
attacks “good enough syndrome”
espouses side-effect benefits of creating something new
devils advocate: can you learn the same thing from rebuilding/tinkering instead of building from scratch?

Alex’s Pre-show Notes

ArnoldC - GREATEST LANGUAGE EVER
Jokes are important

Life is terrible, Let’s talk about the web
If ever there was a wheel that should be taken to Mt Doom and cast into the fire, it’s Javascript
A wheel is not a ring, but you know what I mean
