Justin’s Pre-show Notes
Code of Ages
almost a competition between companies to create new languages
languages like ruby, created by a person for fun that made it big? can’t think of any others? clojure? python is so different from its origin story
new languages highly tailored to company. should they make it to the public?
designed by Google to help solve Google’s problems
instead of addressing problems in python
“You have to ask: Is it better than what we have?”
Swift was created because Objective-C was terrible - programmer happiness goal
article doesn’t really have argument against swift being created, just how it was handled (open source vs closed)
Erlang, Java, FORTRAN, COBOL, C# many more come from businesses wanting their own language. Help shape the next language.
Why isn’t there 1 language that we’re all helping to shape?

Don’t tell me
attacks “good enough syndrome”
espouses side-effect benefits of creating something new
devils advocate: can you learn the same thing from rebuilding/tinkering instead of building from scratch?

Alex’s Pre-show Notes

ArnoldC - GREATEST LANGUAGE EVER
Jokes are important

Life is terrible, Let’s talk about the web
If ever there was a wheel that should be taken to Mt Doom and cast into the fire, it’s Javascript
A wheel is not a ring, but you know what I mean

	00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:10,190
messing around and we are yeah okay

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,089
hahaha we're live oh dear cover well

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:16,640
then um let's get started because we've

00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:19,220
messed around enough why not actually

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,010
talk about stuff and maybe produce an

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,320
interesting and entertaining podcast

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,349
yeah yeah those are all things that we

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,360
probably want to do those are our goals

00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:36,590
girls yeah so welcome to the code supply

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:39,200
initial podcast we have myself Justin

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,430
Reese and Alex shenoy here and we're

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,080
just going to talk about some stuff just

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,640
whatever pops into our heads at the time

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,810
I ever pops into our heads we've

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,670
actually made a nice little list

00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,340
beforehand so it's not going to be

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:56,630
completely disorganized but mostly

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,300
disorganized and hopefully it'll be

00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,910
disorganized in a charming way and not

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,560
knowing where yeah oh look it is our

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:07,520
goal to break the YouTube hit counter

00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:12,020
that's a that's a goal we have yes we're

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,149
where the next side because yeah but

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,770
that's actually something we should talk

00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:23,719
about because that's kind of hilarious

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:25,939
programming problem but yet side broke

00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:31,069
the YouTube hit counter because his

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:32,659
video is more than 32 bits dude right

00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:34,670
something that's something that's how

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,499
the story goes I'm not I don't know the

00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,409
specifics i just read read to headline

00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:41,530
it was like all right file that away for

00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:47,659
something to look look up if i ever care

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:49,579
you know that's ridiculous um but we'll

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,590
talk about things like this talk about

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,759
programming problems programming

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,920
solutions and good supply and codes by

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,909
Sarah um people that don't know we

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,979
should probably give an introduction of

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:05,719
code and supply that's a good point yeah

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:08,560
so go spot is a local programming

00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,230
community in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,780
hopefully people will listen to this or

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,900
watch this

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,459
podcast from outside of Pittsburgh um

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,240
because we're going to try to appeal to

00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:24,610
everyone but what we do is we hold about

00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,480
six events each month focused on

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,670
programming in general we have a nice

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,940
focus on emerging languages like go and

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:40,030
elixir closure and also a nice focus on

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,000
things that are abnormal to programming

00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,920
such as like programming journalism just

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,050
kind of kind of China trying to find the

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,510
most interesting topics we can um we

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,900
just had our end of your party this week

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,390
it was a lot of fun um we celebrated 600

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,220
members in our first year first eight

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,660
months really um and it's it's gaining

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,580
steam and we're going to keep it going

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,870
we're going to keep trying new things

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,840
like this here podcast yeah alex is a

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,959
faithful number i am the founder of code

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,170
and supply and we have a great group of

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,220
people that helped make it happen yeah

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,290
it's great um and the events are held at

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,090
sponsored locations usually it's been

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,360
typically IBM I think but I think you've

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,700
had events at other places too so yeah

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,380
we have great sponsors that help us hold

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:41,440
things and IBM's been incredible to us

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,799
helping us host events and Bruce Adams

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,290
and Colin Dean from IBM have been very

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,530
very important factors in the success of

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:53,950
good inspired because their efforts of

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,920
their their time is just as important as

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,680
IBM's every other space and money yeah

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,220
yeah definitely um so yes I could

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,420
supplies a an awesome organization the

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,660
events are really great it's a great

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,630
community of people and so we're

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,040
probably we're hoping to cover topics in

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,140
the podcast that appeal to that group of

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,289
people but also people that maybe aren't

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:20,950
in couldn't supply yet and this might be

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:24,280
a good Avenue for them to enter and get

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,250
to know the group so or what's our first

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,750
topic it's going to be not exactly a

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,750
topic

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,370
we have a theme for this is owed Damon

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:39,600
yeah it's semi ironic theme of is

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:43,470
creating new things good um like should

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,790
we be doing this podcast right there

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:51,030
yeah yes I things like that um but

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:54,810
really when spyer this was your your

00:04:51,030 --> 00:05:00,270
link to the article called code of Ages

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:05,669
yeah yeah so code of Ages is an article

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:08,310
that's on medium it's I don't remember

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:14,990
who wrote it in one second I can find

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:18,300
out uh so a user called back channel

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,210
it's scott rosenberg wrote this article

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,400
a great article about go and Swift and

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,880
why the languages were created and what

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,350
what problems they solve and so go is

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,360
Google's server-side programming

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,270
language and it solves a lot of googly

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,770
problems problems that you have when you

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,190
have the scale that Google has things

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,770
like concurrency and and go is

00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,910
specifically designed to handle those

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,410
types of tasks and Swift is the other

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,910
language that he talks about Swift is

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:53,280
obviously the new iOS language well the

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,750
new Apple language I guess you can write

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,860
Mac apps too but it's basically the

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:01,050
language that Apple is hoping we'll get

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,940
developers more developers on the iOS

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,690
platform and have make it easier for

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,780
people to pick up the iOS platform and

00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,220
live inside of their ecosystems so the

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,530
question is should these languages have

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,610
been created what were the the what was

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,780
the onus for creating these languages

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,950
and really um you when you hear a lot of

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,660
people when I've heard this said about

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,310
Swift and I've heard it said about go

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,350
and when you talk about these languages

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,390
a lot of people are like why are you

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,979
creating this language or why are you

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,540
reading we're reinventing the wheel why

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,430
don't you just make Python better or why

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,150
don't you just work to make better c

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,440
compilers or something along those lines

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,930
and why couldn't apple just patch

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,270
objective-c to make it where

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,910
well and and really uh so my sort of

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,070
take on this is that at some point you

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,810
have to cut your losses with a language

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,210
and more languages is not necessarily a

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,100
bad thing you know I think a lot of

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,139
people have this stigma around wasting

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,479
effort but I don't think it's wasted

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,150
effort I think that you know we all want

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,650
better tools and better languages and

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,440
better abstractions we want to find

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:12,440
better ways to do the thing that we love

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:18,259
doing and these languages help that

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:20,930
front um so I that's kind of where code

00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,759
of Ages fits into this yeah and what you

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,889
used to used to touch on the point that

00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,720
I kind of I'm trying to play the devil's

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,460
advocate and because I I know your

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,789
position on this is new things are good

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,220
um and I largely agree that new things

00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,979
are good otherwise I wouldn't you know

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,509
be leaving this code and supply

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,330
community right folks is on a lot of new

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:44,419
languages but you know playing devil's

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,699
advocate like why isn't there like one

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:49,490
language that we're all trying to help

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,889
shape to be better or you but not one

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,360
that would be probably too hard to

00:07:51,889 --> 00:08:00,320
address everything with but why didn't

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,210
Google just make Python better and I it

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,210
then why do they need to create their

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,270
own thing um I think so python has a

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,800
number of there's a number of issues

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,180
with why they didn't just make Python

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,550
better i mean python is running you're

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,289
running it inside of a vm they wanted a

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,880
systems language they wanted a language

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:18,919
that compiled down to the metal they

00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,210
really wanted it to be concurrent they

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,830
wanted to be able to do things easily

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,289
right so they created a new language

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,270
where the constructs allow them to do

00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,949
the things that they want to do and it

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,720
allows them to do them efficiently so

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,990
that if you need that kind of

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,829
concurrency you can use you can use go

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,079
to get that the same thing it's kind of

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:41,899
a similar thing like why didn't apple

00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:46,279
just you know by ruby motion and make

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:49,550
the Ruby motion the preferred apple

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,370
developer language um and I think that

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,110
the answer there too is Apple has a

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,080
particular set of goals in a particular

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,880
set of

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,060
constraints that they have to work in

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,610
and you know taking a language like Ruby

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,420
and using it that way is what it's just

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,860
not their style and two I think that

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,900
they in order to do that they would have

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,750
had to have given up some measure of

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,610
control for how things like Swift does a

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,290
really good job of linking into old

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,240
objective-c libraries and you just

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,100
create a bridging header and you can use

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,350
all of the old objective-c libraries you

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,720
can create new swift files within an old

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,490
objective-c project and it does a lot of

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
that kind of stuff really well now you

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,900
can do that in Ruby motion too I mean

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,700
you have access to all the cocoa pods in

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:39,120
a remote in but it's this is a way for

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,440
for Apple to sort of control the

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,450
language in the future their platform

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,060
and I think the same is true for for Go

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,480
Go is actually it's now it is an open

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,620
source project it's not just Google

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,150
working on it anymore but you know I

00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,590
think the reason that these languages

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,790
come out is because you have a certain

00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,740
set of constraints and those constraints

00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,790
you have one or two people that are

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,780
working at a company you're working

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,340
somewhere and they have these

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,800
constraints and they design within them

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,760
and that's why patching piped on to make

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,640
it work you know it's probably not the

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,010
best way to approach the problem because

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,620
Python might not be able to to support

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,650
the constraints that you have yeah and

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:22,610
this article really talked about it it

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,410
brought up hack by Facebook there PHP um

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,800
you know shop shoot and else but it

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,540
really focused on go and Swift but

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,340
something that I felt the article didn't

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:38,640
do all that much was kind of state the

00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,940
different reasons between the two like

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,520
Google created go to be faster they they

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,280
wanted something that would be more

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,570
performant within their environment and

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,710
it seems like Swift at the motivation

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,270
there was a little different it was

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,760
almost like to get more people

00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:00,240
developing for objective-c and make a

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,769
nice or not objective-c for iOS and make

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,679
a nicer way to code so it's really

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,369
two different motivations between

00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:14,209
creating new programming languages

00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:17,610
Google's was Python isn't good enough

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:21,389
for our systems which is you know a very

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:25,439
googley thing to say oh yeah Apple's was

00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:28,019
uh our objective c isn't a beautiful

00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,449
enough language which is another this is

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,819
a very apple thing to say yeah so it's

00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:34,529
very interesting how they like the

00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,980
reasons for creating this new languages

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:39,720
yeah and I think Swift like Apple needed

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,959
Swift right that there I don't think

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,040
there's a single person that thinks that

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,839
if Apple I I don't think there's anybody

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,929
that thinks that objective c is a good

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,579
language or that I mean maybe there's

00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,980
some diehard objectives see people out

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,649
there but I think a lot of people like

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,869
even Apple diehards admit that Apple

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,980
needed a language that you know people

00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,439
are coming out of school and they're

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,089
expecting you know they're expecting

00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:07,559
nicer languages they're learning nicer

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,119
languages and they're learning more

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,949
modern languages that have a lot of

00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:12,420
features and not that objective c

00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,799
doesn't have features and not that you

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,339
know the objective-c runtime didn't have

00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:19,350
a lot of features but the syntax for

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,819
objective-c is just really weird if

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,279
you're coming from any other language

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:24,809
it's just it's it's you can pick it up

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,910
and you can pick it up kind of quickly

00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,889
but when you first look at it it doesn't

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,290
look like any other language right right

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:34,139
I've had a job where you know Don Ruby

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,899
and objective-c and that's that's hard

00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:40,319
it's like yeah oh yeah because one's

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:44,220
just so verbose and one is so much like

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,470
pseudo code that you can just it feels

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,290
even heavier compared to what's out

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,059
there now what's popular now yeah yeah

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,290
and it's interesting you bring up Ruby

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,999
because one of the other one of the

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,959
things that I wanted to bring up was uh

00:12:53,999 --> 00:13:00,540
there's the key note from Ruby con 2012

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,519
I believe we're Matz gives this talk

00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,439
about reinventing wheels and he

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,360
basically says like this is I did this

00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:08,970
because I wanted to do it and you know I

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,290
wanted to reinvent you know I wanted to

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,299
make a language that's what I wanted to

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,679
do and this is the language that I

00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,169
created and it's kind of a replacement

00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,450
for pearl and here you go but in it he's

00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:20,520
in the talk he's basically saying like

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:22,110
creating new things is not bad and it's

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,390
a good thing for us to do you know

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,180
experimentation helps us and I think

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,310
that you know creating go is going to

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,600
help Python or become a better language

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,920
tray like python is getting faster but

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,660
and there's different implementations of

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,250
Python so maybe you could make the

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,580
argument that Google could have made a

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,590
steak a version of the Python syntax

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,310
that still compiled down the machine

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:51,840
code but that would that really be

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:55,560
Python like probably not you know yeah

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:59,520
and um the one thing that I really you

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,330
know got out of that Matt's talk is is

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,750
kind of like the it helped me notice

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:09,180
that not many languages these days that

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,810
are popular kind of started as a project

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:16,020
of passion um that the code of Ages

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:20,420
article points out that Fortran cobol

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:23,460
c-sharp Java arm those all came from

00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,430
companies that needed a something like

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:29,310
you know a swift and a go something that

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,290
fit their needs right and then there's

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,230
also our language you know is another

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,400
one um these languages created a big

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:40,290
giant either corporations or groups but

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,230
there's not much like you know Matt's

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,510
that's his passion project of Ruby where

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:49,280
he just wanted to code better and be

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,720
happy while he's doing it um that's I

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,060
tried to you know think of some other

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,000
examples i think maybe closures written

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,800
by prateek and i looked at kind of the

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,900
only one that i can think of like closer

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,950
probably the last language or somebody

00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
said you know what i want to make a

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,490
language that speaks to the the type of

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,200
programming that i want to do and it's

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,550
going to work using the abstractions

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,990
that i want it's going to be functional

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,820
it's gonna be lispy and it's going to be

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,410
you know that's kind of the last

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,360
language that i can think of that was

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,650
made by somebody saying i want a

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,080
language like this and I'm gonna go

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,670
create it well the last successful one

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,400
because you see that successful one yeah

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,410
yeah people are you know I want to write

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:31,290
a language is kind of like the new thing

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:32,240
to do almost yeah but the like very very

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:36,190
very rarely do

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,760
they make it to the level of mats and

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:42,830
Ruby I and it also led me to look into

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,620
like the origins of Python and all that

00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,270
um and it looks like Python was started

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,850
by a pretty large organization or

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,500
research institute mom to solve a

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:56,420
completely different problem than it is

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,130
today yeah it was meant to uh meant to

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,670
interact with the amoeba files on the

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:05,200
fee amiga operating system i believe ah

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:09,680
i actually don't even know what that is

00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,240
uh-oh who knows what it's uh yeah you

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,540
guys were these languages that are being

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,230
created um go and Swift who knows where

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:23,390
they'll end up being popular in 15 years

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:26,720
like probably yeah I mean I definitely

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,850
agree I I am you know we've talked about

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,890
this before like I am definitely on the

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,560
on the side of like let everyone create

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,120
their own language like you know that

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,120
will decide which ones we want to work

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,480
on which ones we like but ultimately you

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,829
know research like all of that research

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,300
that people do into making their own

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,250
language isn't coming up with new design

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,050
paradigms and new design patterns and

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,810
you abstractions and coming up with new

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:54,230
frameworks all of that stuff like what

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,120
if like what if David had a Meyer Hanson

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,100
had said you know what I'm just I'm just

00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,990
going to use perl era when I use PHP cuz

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,959
that's good enough for me and I don't

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,490
need to I don't need to use this toy

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,920
language Ruby like what if he had said

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,439
that right you know rails wouldn't

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,750
wouldn't be a thing and rails is a great

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,949
framework like probably the best web

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:19,100
framework um and you gotta think of rose

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,890
almost single-handedly led to a pretty

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,429
big boom and you know web applications

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,380
as companies so yeah yeah I mean it's

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,080
definitely inspired a lot of people to

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,150
get into partner I'm again yeah if it

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,960
wasn't for picking up this toy language

00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,400
Ruby knows what were we bang all because

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,410
one guy just wanted to have fun while he

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:45,320
was programming and I think that's kind

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:48,110
of a good thing too um but is it because

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,600
I think you know where I'm gonna go this

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:55,669
about like Arnold see and so Arnold see

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,710
is the language of the future and if you

00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,659
if you're listening to this podcast and

you have not looked at on I'll see you

00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,039

to your organization your company

whatever and and force them to change

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,440
all of their projects over to Arnold see

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,529
it's probably the best language to

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,399
happen in many many years let's see I'm

00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,720
being completely sarcastic so I wanted

00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,549
what's what's Arnold see why don't we

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,909
tell people what I don't see is well

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:28,549
let's uh let's just read from the readme

00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,620
on get up let's see is a programming

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:34,100
language based on the one-liners of

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,360
Arnold Schwarzenegger so hello world and

00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,820
see Arnold see is helloworld dot Arnold

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,950
see that's the file extension thanks to

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,789
John you have to read it in your best

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:50,200
Arnold Schwarzenegger impression voice I

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:54,440
don't know if I want to do that um

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,419
alright I'll do it because if you don't

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,960

alright i'll do my best Arnold for this

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:20,990
um it's show time oh I'm gonna guess

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:25,519
that's kind of like a program

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,379
initializer nah or is that the main of

00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,570
my think I think that's main that's how

00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:33,879
you declare the main method declaration

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:38,659
is it's It's Showtime okay and then um

00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:43,039
taking the parameter hello world is talk

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:44,990
to the hand i'm gonna guess is puts or

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:49,850
it puts her print or something like I

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:54,350
yeah I'm not I favorite see you really

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:57,350
uh translate this and then you have been

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:02,000
terminated ends the file

00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:05,539
as the program so it's really uh should

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,020
things like this exists yes yes one

00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:11,059
hundred percent yes they should exist I

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,770
mean it's a joke this guy like I can't

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,299
imagine that it took this guy more than

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,700
a weekend to put this thing together

00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:19,539
it's I mean it's a joke it's a joke

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,559
jokes are important um I mean I

00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,650
personally really think that this is

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:28,460
hilarious like you know what it's great

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:32,870
because I bet you he learned a lot um oh

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,659
I admit ah and one of my first jobs the

00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:39,470
way I learned ruby was trading

00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:41,900
translator um that took a paragraph of

00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,030
text and translated into the way this

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:50,210
one guy talks he had like this surfer

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:52,700
lingo oh my spare time I was at this PHP

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,730
job trying to learn Ruby and I had this

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,220
little file on my computer that would

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:03,890
take a paragraph and you know I'd bro to

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:05,830
the end of sentences so I mean doing

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:10,760
these experimental kind of things really

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:14,419
yeah something in weird ways to my my

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,909
favorite my favorite method in Arnold

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,470
see is read integer which is I want to

00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,470
ask you a bunch of questions and I want

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,919
them answered immediately look the

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,900
greatest definitely the greatest method

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,400
in the entire language I mean know so

00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,260
like I go to build nights all the time

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,820
and I build like the things that I

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,929
usually build our jokes right like I

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:39,020
started building a apt to scrape

00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:41,240
crunchbase and convert all the monetary

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,740
amounts from dollars to the two factors

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,570
of the amount of money that Microsoft

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,090
paid for Minecraft like that's a joke

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,909
it's it's funny but it's not like is

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:54,280
that useful to anyone no not really like

00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:56,510
what you learned the crunchbase API yeah

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,549
well you learned how long it takes to

00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,990
sign up for the crunch baby I learned I

00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:03,230
learned how long it takes to sign up for

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,190
the crunch basic via oh yeah and then I

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,780
learned that you can't get the

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,790
acquisitions feed directly and you have

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,350
to do a bunch of other stuff to get the

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,460
acquisitions feed which is kind of

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,210
annoying but

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,040
that's whole other topic for another day

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:20,300
someday we'll have to revisit just the

00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:23,420
idea of selling things that are valuing

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,680
things in terms of Minecraft I think

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:32,840
it's more stable than valuing them in

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:35,270
terms of Bitcoin oh so um ok so to

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,600
follow up on 20 pages you actually wrote

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,940
an article yeah I did a while ago ok

00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,560
walk post article I'm gonna give you the

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,990
benefit of the doubt and calling water

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,280
cool all right ok I appreciate that I

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,770
think probably I I think it's a blog

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,150
post but i'll i'll take article that's a

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:58,220
good step up but in 2012 you wrote um

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,010
don't tell me I'm reinventing the wheel

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:04,760
I want you to give a little summary of

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,970
that so yeah so I in 2012 i was writing

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,010
my own sort of blogging platform and i

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,570
had a lot of friends that were just like

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,790
why didn't you use wordpress and i was

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,890
like have you have you seen word print

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,900
like it's terrible wordpress is bad like

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,940
it's it's got all these features that i

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,290
don't need it's just it's just bad like

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,460
all i want is to be able to write mark

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,960
down and have it displayed on a screen

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,980
like I don't need comments I don't need

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,550
up floating I don't need any of this

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,020
stuff right i gets all i need so i was

00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,070
writing this but i had a lot of friends

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,500
that were just saying like don't

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:38,020
reinvent the wheel just use this thing

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,460
and i I've sort of been battling this uh

00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,800
throughout like various stages of my

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,130
career so another one is and these are

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,530
all in the in the blog post there was

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,080
another one where I was trying to make a

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:52,880
forum site for my fraternity in college

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,110
that I want basically what i wanted to

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,910
do is I wanted to take our mailing list

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,890
and just make it a more centralized

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,320
thing and everybody was talking about

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,200
like I should just use PHP v V and I was

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,150
like but PHP PV is it's big like it said

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,310
you know it's good it's a great forum

00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,890
solution but like oh well I'm trying to

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,240
do is like manage these emails that

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:17,270
everybody your scent is sending out

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,950
right and um basically what the the blog

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,170
post is is sort of like a reaction to

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,730
that and I'm basically making the

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:25,260
argument that one like when I'm when I'm

00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,360
making some of the stuff like the wheels

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,040
that they don't want me to reinvent or

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,260
terrible what they suck you know

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,820
WordPress is you know it's a full-blown

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,160
content management system it's way more

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,160
complicated than then I think you need

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,400
for just a simple blog another one that

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,050
I talked about is tiny MCE like I don't

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,030
know a single person that uses tiny MCE

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,910
and actually likes it like it's it's

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:51,390
terrible right as Oh as a WYSIWYG it

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,090
look whenever you put in a stylized text

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,910
it goes to the database and these spans

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:03,300
right with spans with inline styling and

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:04,830
it's it's just bad like it's not it you

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,000
don't want to represent your data like

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,260
that in the database and I don't

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,400
understand why people think that that's

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,660
a good thing I don't know I don't

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,120
understand why the time um see you guys

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:16,200
think that's a good thing not to call

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,900
them out but you guys need to figure out

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,060
a better data model um let's look like

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,640
we call out enemies let's not create

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:27,420
enemies of the show already yes comply I

00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,660
know so so like I think the point was

00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:34,230
that like the tools that I am creating

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,910
our tools that like one there are things

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,110
that I want to learn so for example the

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,120
WYSIWYG editor I wanted to learn the

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,030
canvas API for html5 and I thought that

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,300
was a good way to do it because I could

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:48,810
learn the html5 canvas api's I could

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,550
make a WYSIWYG editor that use the

00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,030
formatting that I wanted it to use and

00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:56,700
then I could you know eventually publish

00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,070
it which I never did but um because I

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,050
cuz ghost came out and then I was like

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:05,910
oh this is exactly what I wanted to have

00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:07,890
so there's that but I guess it comes it

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,930
comes from this this place where people

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,450
think that like oh this thing that is

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:15,720
out there is good enough and it might be

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,420
good enough but maybe you could create

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,100
something better right and there are

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,320
there are definitely side benefits

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,820
fringe benefits too even when you see

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,300
something like when you go to create it

00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,410
you'll figure out like why why maybe you

00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,940
think that something doesn't make sense

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,260
an implementation for something and

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,960
maybe when you're creating it you'll

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,670
figure out why they chose that you know

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,200
like what reasons they had or what

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,929
constraints they had that forced

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,330
that decision so my blog post is really

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:44,070
just a reaction to that to this sort of

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,559
it's good enough don't reinvent the

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,970
wheel don't like don't create you just

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,740
like pick something off the shelf and

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:54,240
use that and my argument is if I don't

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,789
like what's on the shelf then I should

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,740
make make my own thing yeah and I this

00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,630
conversation inspired me to open the art

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,220
wikipedia article on the wheel um you

00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:11,059
know what people did reinvent the wheel

00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,980
because you know the first wheel sucked

00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,860
we're getting better every every day we

00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,380
have we have tires that are built for

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,080
winter weather attraction um that's

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,389
reinventing the wheel yeah you know what

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,029
you're doing you're you're not riding

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:29,429
your car on wooden disks like they they

00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:32,100
did a you know a couple hundred years

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:36,929
ago or you know a metal tire or

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,419
completely metal wheels at and we've

00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:42,090
added tires and we have reinvented the

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,639
wheel it's it's not it's not bad

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:47,850
worrying about the wheel no it's emily

00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:50,159
and i i i phrase it this way right like

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,389
nobody everybody a lot of people have to

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,889
talk to you don't want to reinvent like

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:55,200
you shouldn't reinvent the wheel but I

00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:57,470
think that everyone that I know would

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,970
like to have a nicer wheel like if

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,070
Firestone said we can make a tire for

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,789
half the price that goes twice as far so

00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:10,200
you pay the same amount and you get

00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:11,460
twice the mileage off of it like I'm

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,860
pretty sure everybody would want well

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,210
maybe not Firestone but but i'm pretty

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,350
sure people would want that right like

00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,409
that's a thing that people would want

00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,529
i'm sure that there's some engineer at

00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:26,880
firestone or good good year and their

00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:29,580
title is we already inventor we orient

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,769
better if i would have that on my

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,200
business card if I were an engineer in

00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:37,850
the and the tire in the entire

00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,039
department at at these places yes

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,659
that's that's really good a that's

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,710
that's impressive you you know that's a

00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,809
business card you should you should

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,549
definitely I might just get a business

00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:51,210
card that says will reinvent ur just

00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:53,820
like just to have it like yeah I think

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,610
how people would appreciate that yeah um

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,370
and I think something that your article

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,350
does a great job of is like espousing

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:04,140
this the side effects that you the

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,400
benefits that you get from creating

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,799
something new every time you do the

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,590
every time that you reinvent that wheel

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,559
you're learning something about how that

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,780
wheel is built in the first place and

00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,070
yeah you can take it further yeah and

00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,380
you get to a main knowledge about the

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,630
problem that that that that library or

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,799
application is solving right so there

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:30,390
are there's things specific to blogging

00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,039
that is domain knowledge for that and

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,530
how you you handle it that I didn't have

00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,799
right like and how you represent data

00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,289
and in a good way and what the best gem

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,820
is to render markdown at HTML and what

00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:43,409
to do if the gym doesn't support

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,419
something like there's there's domain

00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:47,520
knowledge there that's and that's a

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:51,230
really simple example but you can easily

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,600
see how like a more complicated thing

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,610
like a task scheduling gem or something

00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,620
if you created a new one you can easily

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,780
see how that would give you domain

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,659
knowledge about task scheduling that you

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,039
could then apply to other things and you

00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,919
also never know what kind of benefits

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,440
you'll come come out with like you said

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,049
there are dependencies on creating a

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,929
blogging system and maybe one of those

00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:18,929
dependencies is kind of bad like maybe

00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:21,179
there's no good markdown parser there is

00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:22,830
but you know but yeah as an example

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:24,299
maybe there's not as an example maybe

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,250
there's there's nothing really good out

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,250
there maybe you'll you'll write the good

00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,110
one so yeah maybe you won't you know

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:34,890
invent a better wheel but your own

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:37,260
benefit or spoke or something yeah you

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:40,860
want to talk about the web yeah let's

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,620
talk about the web you know hi how do

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:48,360
you fill out the web uh I think there's

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:51,309
a great talk that is really really just

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,019
hits this topic on the head

00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:57,370
called life is terrible let's talk about

00:30:53,019 --> 00:31:00,720
the web yeah which is a video that we

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:02,889
both watch is kind of a rant it's a

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,690
while you you found the thing you sent

00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:10,059
it to me so you sort of introduced it

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:14,320
sure I mean it's just another given up

00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:16,870
yet another talk about how life is

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,200
terrible because we all have to use

00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:24,399
JavaScript um and it just reminded me of

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,009
a classic election or ran it felt great

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,600
um to hear someone say these and it's

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:31,090
probably one of the funnier talks I've

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,610
seen in a long time and I think it's

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:37,600
important that we uh let our audience

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:39,759
know about this um yeah yeah I so in the

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,990
in the show notes I wrote like if ever

00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,970
there was a wheel that should be taken

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:46,539
to Mount Doom and cast into the fire its

00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,950
JavaScript and then I'm gonna put like

00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:51,129
another note that said a wheel is not a

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,889
ring but you know what I mean um but

00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:55,659
that's that's another yeah I just

00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,070
switching metaphors whatever um but

00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:59,080
that's another thing that Google's got

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,169
dart Microsoft has what is a typescript

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,350
it's like a superset of JavaScript I

00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:06,789
think something like that um

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,559
CoffeeScript compiles down to two

00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,139
JavaScript and it's more of a classy

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,409
sort of implementation classy is in it

00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:16,869
uses classes not you know not that it's

00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:18,490
classier it's not that holds its pinkie

00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:21,669
up what it takes it yeah not not that it

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:24,970
like yeah um but that's another one

00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:28,720
where like yeah that's another one

00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:33,129
that's you know a language that a lot of

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,049
people you know I I think Doug Douglas

00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:36,759
Crockford has probably the best quote

00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,799
it's like the only language that people

00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:41,379
use without learning how to without

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,840
learning first right I think that's like

00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:46,119
quote it's something something close to

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,230
that um but that's a language a lot of

00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:50,860
people are trying to like get away from

00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:54,460
having to use JavaScript right yeah and

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,820
I am I don't want to get too deep into

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,899
my hatred of JavaScript turn this show

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,879
into that but maybe maybe we can you

00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,960
know start a discussion about it someday

00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:07,120
and

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,090
I think which price save it though and

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,880
yeah because I do it later that could be

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:17,049
a full episode on the benefits the cons

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,210
of and the world of job creating new

00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:22,210
JavaScript frameworks every week yeah

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:24,789
because there are so many JavaScript

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,370
frameworks yeah F&A we found a way to

00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:30,820
like tie this awesome talk that we just

00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:34,870
want to share back into our our theme

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,360
for the day yeah yeah yeah so it's a

00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:40,600
successful successful first episode I

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,260
think yeah do we have anything else that

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,529
we want to talk about or is that I don't

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:50,250
think so i think that um we covered all

00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:53,770
of our points that we hope to cover and

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,929
we created a pretty decent you know half

00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,390
hour of discussion yeah hopefully people

00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:00,370
will be entertained by it and there will

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:05,559
be a reason to create a second one yeah

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,909
hopefully um yeah so I guess we should

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,419
probably do like Twitter handles so

00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:14,950
people can follow us and yeah so I'm

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:19,419
Alex shenoy on Twitter yet and I am just

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:21,010
an ex Reese X as an x-ray vision is

00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:22,929
because you have it that's your

00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,490
superpower your superpowers x-ray vision

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:27,760
no no that's my middle name thanks

00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:30,760
Richard nations your middle name no

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,399
that's you had some sweet parents yeah

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,710
and also you follow at code and supply

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,830
so you can keep up to date when one will

00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:42,040
do our next podcast ah our goal is to do

00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:44,820
these uh once a month i believe and will

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:48,070
typically be me and alex as hosts um

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:52,869
what kind of guide alex i'll be the host

00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:54,369
and Alex will be the color come and then

00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:56,560
hopefully next month we'll start

00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:59,170
bringing on the guest a third host to

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,420
really just make this more of a hangout

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,200
the discussion and get some more

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,740
viewpoints in here um I think that's

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,220
good uh and Alex say goodbye to the

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:15,089
people goodbye to the people by people
