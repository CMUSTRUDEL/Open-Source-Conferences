00:00:53,089 --> 00:01:03,890
same nice i'll leave it at that too I

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,990
like that yeah um so I guess we can

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,920
start off with you've done a lot of work

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,410
in the responsive design area i know we

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
we recently where i work had a huge push

00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,740
in responsive die and everybody was when

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,910
when i talked about the fact we're gonna

00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,020
be interviewing you that was the one

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:24,490
thing that everybody said like mr.

00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:28,040
responsive design himself um so I guess

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:32,720
like you're more of a web web designer

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,450
developer like how do you view that

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,710
transition into responsive now as we

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,510
have different devices that are

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,690
different sizes and everything like

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,610
what's that been like yeah yeah so it

00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,070
might actually help to sort of set the

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,310
stage a little bit on sort of how I got

00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,740
into that whole world i was living in

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,320
new york city at the time and i had sort

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,070
of a job that i was a little bit burned

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,740
out by which is a severe understatement

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,940
but so i needed a new job and i ended up

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,680
getting a job at an agency called rga in

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,429
New York City so be like big digital

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,940
agency and the only job they had open at

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:17,840
the time was free mobile web developer

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,660
and I was sort of like uh like okay I

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,720
guess you know I use that asthma as my

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,230
foot in the door and then eventually

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,190
I'll get to make real websites so this

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,200
is like late 2009 early 2010 so by that

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,440
time you know the iphone was already out

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,540
uh but so yeah so I I got there and I

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,120
was working on so the big brand sites

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,970
for Nike and MasterCard and sort of

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,070
sliced like that and just looking at the

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,310
the sort of markup that made up these

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,280
you know m dot sights at the time was oh

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:56,360
you know it's his pretty gross gross

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,000
looking stuff so so anyway so yeah so of

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,490
course after a couple months of working

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,260
there you know that you know the light

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,470
bulb went off and it was like oh my god

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,230
like this is where everything's going

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:11,570
and of course you know saw the launch of

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,430
the ipad and so so you know sort of

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,440
getting into the weeds sort of specific

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,020
to to mobile as in like and you know

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,420
making mobile specific things and in

00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:24,530
learning you know how complicated and

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,600
how diverse the support and and

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,250
everything is across that it was a whole

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,800
different ballgame and then whenever

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,870
tablets came out you know dude again

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,870
more work with nike use like oh we need

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,209
to have an ipad version of nike com and

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,209
so you know like had to work on that and

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,610
stuff so is really sort of fun to touch

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,739
all this stuff literally right as it was

00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,410
starting to come out and then eventually

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,540
got to a point where you know we had

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,690
some projects we wanted to do and we

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,959
wanted to deploy it to its so sort of

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,709
weird nike ended up having actually four

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:04,040
distinct code bases for nike com sort of

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:07,220
a a mobile I'm sorry a desktop site a

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,530
tablet site and iphone site dedicated

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,790
iphone site and then I sort of like I

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,560
hate you everybody else mobile site so

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,739
whatever Android was sort of coming out

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,620
its they got this like crusty dirty old

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,160
experience it was really sort of amazing

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,889
but so anyway so yeah we we wanted to

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,289
make uh you know this

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:33,129
one particular project we wanted to put

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:37,969
it in all those buckets right so we made

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:40,759
this sort of like fluid a thing that can

00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:42,710
we could you know just simply shove into

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,539
all these different sized boxes and

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,219
stuff so sort of like you know i guess

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:48,800
like responsive design before is

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:52,219
responsive design and it was sort of

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,770
right as a me and a colleague Jack

00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:59,719
bishop we're giving a presentation on

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:02,900
this internally at our agency and we are

00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:05,000
calling it adaptive design and uh and

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,430
then this will list a part article by I

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,469
Ethan Marcotte came out and we're like

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,759
let's check that into our slides is like

00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:13,520
here it looked like other people are

00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,689
talking about this too so so yeah so

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,659
that's what sort of kicked the whole

00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:20,150
thing off where it was um sort of going

00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,740
from okay let's make stuff for phones

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,180
and I was like up here's these tablets

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,400
out let's make stuff for phones and

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,979
tablets and then up holy smokes this is

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,469
really really difficult even with you

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,659
know brands that have a bunch of money a

00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:34,490
bunch of resources and stuff to throw at

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,379
this stuff it's it was still

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,419
overwhelming just even in those early

00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,300
days so that's what sort of like gave

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:44,360
rise to you know let's take a step back

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,270
and let's figure out some ways to you

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:53,270
know sort of create things in a smarter

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:55,849
more flexible way cool was there ever a

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,860
prior to like you know you sort of said

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:01,879
like oh okay I'll get in there and do

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:07,250
deal real websites mm-hmm was there a

00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:10,039
moment of the classic argument of this

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,560
this mobile website thing isn't gonna

00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:15,939
catch on at any point oh my god yeah I

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,319
spent I spent my entire career at our GA

00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,310
convincing people that that mobile

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,740
mattered and increasingly it became uh

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:28,039
you know first of all it's like yeah

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,839
this mobile thing it it might be around

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,029
we'll throw it a bone will throw it a

00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:35,149
couple grand you know just just whip us

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:37,759
up a quick a quick site when but at most

00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,440
you know at the absolute most people

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,260
would be seeing you know five or ten

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,710
percent of their traffic coming from

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,320
mobile devices so is like get got 5% of

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,380
the attention five percent of the budget

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,600
in all of that and so you know while I'm

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,130
there shouting myself hoarse it was sort

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,140
of saying like hey this needs to become

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,550
more and more a priority of course that

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,700
hockey stick of adoption of mobile

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,010
between yeah late 2009 in two thousand

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,460
like 12 13 or whatever it just it

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,590
exploded so that was cool as cold as

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,280
sort of get in there a little bit early

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,980
but there's also not just like mobile as

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,600
a medium I think like not too many

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,240
people were saying like this is never

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,010
going to catch on but there's plenty of

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,300
people out there and this continues to

00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:31,420
this very day I people that say ah but

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,580
mobile mobile users won't do that but

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,900
mobile users don't don't want to do that

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,000
right and and so that became this sort

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,520
of rallying cry and you know sort of

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,950
like my shorthand for that was like you

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,680
know like mobile users will do anything

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,960
and everything a desktop user will do it

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,420
just has to be there like you you just

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,820
have to provide it um case in point like

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:57,190
and this is again sort of pre responsive

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,450
days it's working lot safer tiffany.com

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:03,970
that the jewelry company and it's like

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,670
you know they had a desktop only site at

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,660
the time when we launched the mobile

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,730
version of the site uh you know we saw

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,770
these huge lifts in their conversion

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,330
rates and it's it's again it's one of

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,210
those things where like as an outsider

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,970
you go I like who would buy a twelve

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,710
thousand dollar engagement ring from

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,840
their phone like that's absurd like

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,850
nobody's gonna do that yeah yeah they do

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,470
and they do they do a lot and and again

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,440
this is played out time and time again

00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,960
you know cost every single vertical you

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
know ebay sells yachts and private jets

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,210
and all sorts of stuff from their mobile

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,930
apps all the time yelp was it was a big

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,300
hold out for letting mobile users enter

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,980
reviews from their phones because they

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,110
were like oh just think of all the typos

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,970
just think of all the the misspellings

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,069
and the emojis it'll be a trainer

00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,730
and and then whenever they finally

00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:02,470
reluctantly let people enter reviews

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,500
from their phones it's now well over

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,050
fifty percent of all reviews on Yelp are

00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,350
coming from over devices so so it's it's

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,089
really not a matter of you know whether

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,459
or not mobile users are going to do it

00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:18,269
it's just how much you're going to to

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:21,370
put in you know make the effort to make

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:24,129
that mobile experience just as great or

00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:28,240
hopefully maybe even better than then

00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:30,490
the desktop experience is so go ahead

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,660
Tiffany so is there much of a

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:40,240
distinction now between native mobile

00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,610
apps and mobile websites um I'm from

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
from an experience standpoint from a

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,720
text standpoint from a feature

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,879
standpoint or what um from a from a tech

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,329
and feature standpoint mm-hmm yeah well

00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:57,310
so long story short native the web is

00:09:55,329 --> 00:10:00,759
never going to be as capable as native

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:03,129
right native azazel as closer to the you

00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,839
note you know the rubber meets the road

00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,490
it's like it's right there it's a its

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,149
native like it's right in the definition

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,189
so native by definition you know lives

00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:16,029
natively on your phone so it's going to

00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:17,949
have access to the device api's and all

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,660
the features that are are you know

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:22,209
coming out and sort of shipped with

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,610
these new handsets and stuff so they're

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,829
always going to be sort of one step

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,100
ahead of the web but that's that's

00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,930
really not the point yeah so native apps

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,899
are great and and technologically

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,089
speaking like if you have a valid reason

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:40,209
for creating a native app you need

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,509
access to touch ID or you need access to

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:47,350
a lot of some device API that that the

00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:48,970
web can access or and/or you you need

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,610
that sort of you know branded experience

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,319
that that home home screen icon and

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,209
stuff that that thing that people are

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,329
going to you're hoping that they're

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:01,449
going to be using every single day yeah

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:03,250
yeah you you making a native app makes

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,079
perfect sense you get hardware

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,339
acceleration for free you get like a lot

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,649
of sort of performance stuff for free

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:12,459
again because it's all living there

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:15,040
on the device but that being said you

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:18,100
know the web is the largest publishing

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,550
platform that mankind has ever devised

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,889
right so so it's not really a matter and

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,749
I this was another sort of argument you

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,480
know working at the agency and again

00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:30,610
continues to this day of which one

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,160
should we do and that's really not the

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,499
question it's it's about you know play

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,379
each medium to their respective

00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:40,899
strengths native mobile technology is

00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:43,269
fantastic it could do these next level

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,059
things that really take advantage and

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:50,199
capitalize on this new technology but

00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:53,369
again the simple URL is an amazing

00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:55,990
amazing amazing feature so you know the

00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:59,529
ability to send your content your

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,929
functionality down to to anybody on any

00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,819
operating system on any mobile carrier

00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:07,089
on any mobile you know sort of

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:08,949
manufacturer on any I whatever without

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,259
having to ask permission without having

00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:13,179
to download any special software like we

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:16,389
take this for granted but like up until

00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:18,519
25 years ago that did not exist so so

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:22,029
again it's about playing each medium to

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,470
their respective strengths yeah I am I

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:24,970
was on the bus the other day and I saw

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,550
someone using the mobile version of

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,029
Facebook which really surprised me um so

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:34,990
I was just curious to see how um you

00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:38,139
leverage either mobile web or uh native

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,350
apps yeah and I I haven't seen updated

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:45,759
stats but for a long time at least and

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:49,629
this is maybe 23 years ago Facebook's

00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:52,299
MDOT experience had more usage by far

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:55,600
than their their native iOS and Android

00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:58,149
apps combined that's probably change I

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,420
spent what we're talking here to is

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,579
worldwide right at the time you know

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,129
Android adaptation like if you look at

00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:08,319
Android adaptation around the world

00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,749
versus in the u.s. it's a much much

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:13,509
different story right not everybody in

00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:15,490
Southeast Asia and you know Africa and

00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,620
Europe and stuff even for that matter

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,240
are walking around with iPhones in their

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,080
pocket right a lot of these sort of

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,150
lower and Android devices are really

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:29,460
really popular but all that all that

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:32,310
being said many people uh their lens too

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,290
uh you know this this rich world this

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,400
rich internet world is through the

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,920
browser you know lots of people are

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,620
around the world or still on 2g networks

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,170
and things like that lots of people at

00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,060
the time whenever I was still doing like

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,370
mobile specific stuff looking at

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,260
people's stats you know looking at like

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,960
South Africa stats and stuff and seeing

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:58,350
this like this at the time even like an

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,390
eight year old samsung phone was like so

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,160
pre Android whatever is just I don't

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,430
even know what so maybe like a net-front

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,370
browser or something was the most

00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,740
accessed yet what was the the device

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,140
that was most accessing that the site

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,080
stats that i was looking at so um so

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:19,170
yeah so for a lot of people like the

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,510
browser is it and in technologies like

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,450
opera mini which is a proxy browser that

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,280
sort of compresses web pages down and so

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,040
that gives people sort of like a very

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:33,900
functional but also sort of a relatively

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,880
bite-size edition of a web page these

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,000
are transformative technologies that are

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:44,130
giving people access to the basic power

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,170
of the web so yeah so it's it's really a

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,380
crapshoot and really i'd say at the end

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,440
of the day it's like you can try to

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,090
funnel people from one direction to

00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,370
another you could try to get people to

00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,620
download the app and lord knows they try

00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,210
right every every site you go to is like

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,390
hey have you downloaded our appt hey

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,010
have you download our app right but like

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,110
but at the end of the day people are

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,210
going to use things the way that they

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,700
want to and in what a lot of times what

00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,220
I what I tell the clients I consult with

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,880
and sort of former clients is I'm like

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,830
do you do are you on social media and

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,970
they're like what sort of question is

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,100
that you know of course they're on

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,890
social media I like well do you ever

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,420
share links to your website and they're

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,040
like yeah and it's like okay well then

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,220
it needs be it you know needs to work on

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,650
mobile right and so that was that was

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,790
sort of a big trick selling these

00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,740
concepts and stuff

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,230
to clients because if at the time

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,390
whenever mobile was exploding if there's

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,490
one word bigger than mobile it was

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,310
social right so it's like do you want to

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:52,050
be mobile and social I and it is or like

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:53,670
yeah of course maybe how do I do that so

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,490
that's sort of how I used to sort of

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,440
sneak in responsive design yeah I

00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,050
remember this is going back a few years

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,970
but I remember a few years ago my sort

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:04,590
of aha moment and mobile was gonna be

00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,270
huge I was in a bar with a bunch of

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,240
friends and we were talking about a

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,410
concert that I had known about for

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,780
months and just forgot to buy tickets

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,600
for and the concert was the next day and

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,820
so a friend of a friend was going to the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,350
same concert she brought it up and I was

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,880
like oh yeah I forgot to buy tickets and

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,440
I pulled out my phone and just on the

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,830
web browser my phone went and bought

00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,740
tickets it was like I'm like this is

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,840
great you know what um so that was kind

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,390
of my big moment of like yeah the web is

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,500
gonna be it's gonna be huge on mobile

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,850
phones and I'm actually one of the

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,710
people that uses the facebook mobile

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,110
website instead of the app despite the

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:43,590
fact that I've got like an iPhone 6 you

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:47,340
know yeah yeah yeah and again it's it

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:49,050
it's it's amazing what people will do

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,560
again there's that you know they're

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,660
there is your your expected behavior and

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,820
then there's actual behavior and you you

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,430
won't believe you know the amount of

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,290
sort of backflips people will do in

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,650
order to accomplish a task in the way

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,510
that they either see fit or they for in

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,720
a lot of cases like they have to write

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:12,900
whenever people either by way of display

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,410
none on a responsive site or just simply

00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,240
like not including features or content

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,120
and not achieving that content parody

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,760
across devices people will do amazing

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,510
things to to get done what they need to

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,580
get done and again like I speak all over

00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,080
the place I have a lot of workshops and

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,680
workshop attendees and stuff and people

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,840
go yeah but like you know this is um you

00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,230
know this is like I work on like

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,060
mortgage applications and stuff or it's

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,780
like I'll like you know like a job

00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,820
application form uh it's like who's

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,800
gonna who's going to actually like sit

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,290
through that big of a forum

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,640
and then you CPU research coming out

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,840
with stat after stat where it's

00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,880
basically you know uh the numbers gone

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,710
up it's now like thirty three percent of

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,620
people like that live below the poverty

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,510
line use their phone as their primary or

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,300
soul way of getting online so it's like

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,920
it's not about like that the the tedium

00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,690
of actually filling out a job

00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,330
application looks like that is their

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:18,360
only way to do that like that is their

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,880
only lends to making this task happens

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,710
right so you know you have the UN coming

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,570
out and saying that internet access is a

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,060
human right and stuff and I do I feel

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:31,080
like it's our job as people that that

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:33,150
create for the web to to recognize and

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,590
create for you know an accessible

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,630
experience and not I don't mean like

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,150
accessibility and like that you know

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,460
using the right Aria roles i'm talking

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,980
about just broadly right we want to cast

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,680
as broad of a net as possible and that's

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,110
not only just good for you know human

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,840
beings that's good for business right

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,610
you get more eyeballs more users looking

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,070
at your stuff using your stuff like

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,780
that's great for business so so it's

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,350
very weird like the juxtaposition

00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,230
between a lot of time and people a lot

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,120
of times people say uh you know like we

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,700
only have like all we care about our

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,930
iphones right screw everybody else like

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,060
we just wouldn't need to make sure that

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,180
our site like works well on eye on

00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,580
iphones and why oh well you know i have

00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,620
an iphone or or the CEO has an iphone or

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,260
whatever but like then you actually get

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,420
out there realize that you know people

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,430
are using a whole host of devices to

00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,560
access your site so it's like we need to

00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,080
to think bigger and we need to act

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,460
bigger and again yeah cast that broader

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,490
net and and it's it's it's amazing like

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,530
how aligned those sort of philosophical

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,810
goals of like the web being good for

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,240
Humanity and the web being good for

00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:50,940
business how a line those goals really

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:55,140
are does anybody remember when Instagram

00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,420
was coming out for uh for Android and

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,010
they're like a bunch of people like that

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,270
just got completely ridiculous about

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:05,920
yeah like b li rui strange i don't know

00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,750
it is lienemann yeah like all these

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,000
android people were just like invading

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,320
their Clubhouse or something yeah yeah

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,270
yeah i er around that was just

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,860
ridiculous have you seen have you seen

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,800
more recently have you seen the whole

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:24,370
green bubbles thing no I haven't heard

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,840
about that so you know how I message if

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,090
you're if you're on an iPhone and you

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,900
message another person they have a blue

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,120
bubble in your text message thing but if

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:37,300
you're if you're a text messaging with a

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,550
with an Android user or a non smartphone

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,280
user some other platform you you have a

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,860
green bubble and so there's like a green

00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,890
bubble hate out there where it's like I

00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:52,390
don't respect you if i'm texting you and

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:58,360
you have a green bubble it's really

00:20:52,390 --> 00:21:00,370
terrible I that stems Jim didn't Tim

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,600
Cook make a comment or maybe this phil

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,210
schiller somebody at Apple made a

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,640
comment when they were doing the the

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,960
continuity and handoff stuff um they

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,910
were like demoing now like oh you can

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,330
answer you can now answer text messages

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,920
on your on your on your macbook like

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,720
somebody made a comment about the fact

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,890
that like I message is this great thing

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,720
and you can answer messages from

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,320
everywhere except for these green bubble

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,630
people like an apple actually said that

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,830
on stage yeah well there we go that's it

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:32,320
that's either either causation of that

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,480
trend or the trend sort of bled on to

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:41,440
apples stage one way or the other it's

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:45,490
I'd say not healthy yeah somewhat

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,830
somewhat less depressingly uh is but

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,070
still conversationally is Firefox OS

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,380
still a thing is uh I think they put the

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,620
kibosh on it yeah really to yeah up

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,770
until recently and um yeah I had a few

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,810
friends actually sort of either working

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:04,570
directly on it or I sort of building

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,940
stuff for it and so it definitely had

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,520
you know some some interesting things

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,620
there and there there have been a lot of

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,320
sort of crossovers between sort of the

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,870
the actual sort of

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,130
operating system of the phone and the

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:23,009
web palms webos I've sort of famously

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,929
you know was yeah I was like all written

00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:27,269
in like web technologies and stuff like

00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,460
that and firefox OS and like there's

00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:32,789
some like smart thinking going on there

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,299
but man like that I think of that world

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:39,240
is just crowded and it's it's like

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,789
nobody cares like what technology is

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,009
built with its it's about like does it

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:45,960
does it have facebook does it have email

00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:49,110
does it have my calendars does it have

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,559
that that game that had bejeweled and

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:56,490
and all like what whatever other games

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,620
so it I don't envy anybody operating in

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,470
that world and it's it's been really

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,269
sort of wild seeing things uh you know

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,539
rise and fall over the years like

00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:09,480
whenever i started at our GA I mean we

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,029
had like the motorola G or their the g

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,220
one which was like the original android

00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:18,240
and then it was just like this potpourri

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,799
of other devices that that came out and

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,200
you notice everybody was trying

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,600
everything under the sun and you know

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,860
even in the like cousin yeah like a even

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,169
a pre iphone they reach yeah yeah yeah i

00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,870
love those phones they're cute yeah i

00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:36,059
really wanted a pony for a long time I

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,250
only wanted a trio but were you gonna

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,139
say oh no that's like I was just gonna

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,090
comment on the palm pre like I think the

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:45,269
problem there was not necessarily the

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,610
platform was those creepy commercials I

00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:50,879
don't remember the commercial it was

00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:53,250
with that like uh they have like a woman

00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:54,779
on them and she was like turn slowly and

00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,029
like the lighting was really weird the

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:01,019
music was kind of eerie and she sort of

00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:05,879
looked like she was like the Borg Queen

00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,289
from Star Trek and like and then she

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:09,870
would she always said something like

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,220
really weird and just like strange and

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:16,289
it's like how does that relate to your

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,639
phone I don't understand um I think it

00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,679
was a marketing problem because the palm

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,139
pre actually was a really nice device I

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,889
never had it and loved it I still have

00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:27,030
one yeah I remember watching air you

00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,920
know listening to

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,810
sir ever and having people like leo

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,450
laporte and other people will be like

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:38,100
yeah Bree it's great like a year later

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:40,560
they're like oh never mind yeah yeah I

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,350
guess I guess also for anyone who

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,700
doesn't know about Firefox OS since it

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,950
is kind of I mean it wasn't really even

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,260
marketed whenever it was marketed at all

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:53,130
wasn't marketed in in the u.s. very much

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,290
I guess it was like a UH is for

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,860
developing markets for sure yeah it was

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,660
a low-power device cheaply made cheaply

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,270
distributed and now that's what they're

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:07,020
aiming for and and everything was was

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:09,570
based around like all of the apps on the

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,250
phone we're all web sort of based type

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,610
things yeah which is which is a neat

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:17,940
thing because then I'll say like like

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,460
you also said earlier like I you can

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,050
just go to a website and then you don't

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,540
have to worry about getting that or

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,950
whatever yeah yeah and yeah and that's

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,780
been around for a while I mean like

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,210
obviously you know there's there's meta

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,300
tags and stuff to add you know the

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,610
apples touch ID or you know you could

00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,320
save it to your your homescreen and

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,390
stuff like that and that's sort of how

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,540
it started and actually sort of in the

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,400
in the pre you know App Store days like

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,470
that's what people did is like I'm going

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,290
to go to cnn.com and like save it to my

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,060
home screen and stuff like that but that

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,970
those have gotten it's been an

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,890
interesting evolution of of these sort

00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:59,040
of like hybrid technologies like what is

00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,890
the relationship between the native

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,800
mobile platform and the web and you know

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,540
because people aren't necessarily firing

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,720
up their browser like that's not the

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:13,110
path that they that they you know tend

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,000
to get to web pages I mean the case in

00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,100
point you know Facebook's browser is the

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,050
most popular mobile browser it's like

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,360
you know and Omega no makes sense is

00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,190
because you know it'll you see a bunch

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,650
of stats that just don't make any sense

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,950
it's like oh like you know people spend

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:32,100
X amount of their time in you know

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,260
social apps and in native apps and like

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,180
barely any time on the web it's like

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,100
yeah but what are they actually doing in

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,230
that app it's like yeah they're looking

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,890
at text updates and photo updates and

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,720
videos and

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,970
like that but they're also clicking on a

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,550
bunch of links and reading stories and

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:51,180
things like that it's it's again that

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:55,110
that wall between native and web has

00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:57,810
never been very very thick and sort of

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:00,120
siloed and rigid it's this very fluid

00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,310
thing and I think that's something to to

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,580
embrace rather than sort of create some

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:09,390
artificial / if you want to talk about

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,130
tech though it's like for a while you

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,100
know there's like PhoneGap there's other

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:17,420
sort of solutions out there to sort of

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,610
use web technology to make native apps

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,880
like that stuff's all great and it's

00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:26,220
that you know it's all evolved over the

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,810
last five or so years and stuff and now

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,670
we have sort of like progressive apps

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,160
which I'm actually I think a little more

00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:34,710
excited about that it's sort of they

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,440
feel a little more born of the web

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:42,390
rather than a sort of like web

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,220
technology HTML CSS and JavaScript sort

00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,110
of bundled up and then sent down the

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,530
pipes the same way as like as like a

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:52,410
native app would be so that stuff is is

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,680
all sort of I guess on the horizon but

00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:58,680
um and I I could barely wrap my head

00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,170
around half you know most of it i guess

00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,750
but uh but we're getting closer to sort

00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,220
of creating these these sort of more

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,990
seamless experiences cuz really at the

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,810
end of the day like users don't care

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,640
users just don't care right i want to

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,770
look at some photos i want to complete

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,870
this you know i want to apply for a job

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:19,410
i wanted to do this i want to write back

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,810
to my friend like none of that like

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,930
hinges on any specific technology right

00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:28,410
so the more places you could do that

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,990
great the more fluid that process is

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,870
great you know I said it doesn't need to

00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:36,120
be an either/or thing and it's always

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,760
frustrated me like the whole the web is

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,770
dead right now wired came out and said

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,990
that on there there cover a while ago

00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:49,140
it's just like oh god here we go so I'm

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:52,320
rootin for the web yes it's really

00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,570
interesting because I and I'm probably

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,059
in the minority maybe but

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,820
I go out of my way to not install an app

00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:02,159
if there's a good mobile version of the

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,299
site like I will go out of my way to not

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,860
like a that's what I'd with a facebook

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,570
like I use the mobile facebook client

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,230
cuz I don't want to install their app on

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,639
my phone and I do the same thing for uh

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,080
you know stores that I shop at or

00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:15,840
whenever I you think like I'd rather go

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:20,370
to the website then install like you

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,639
know some stores app on my phone um yeah

00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:26,399
yeah my friend Scott Jensen talks about

00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:30,659
this where you know it's he basically

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,820
says do do we really need an app for ya

00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:35,039
every store we go to every Airport we

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:37,649
visit every restaurant we go to every

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,879
service we use it that it's it's tedious

00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:43,710
and any sort of had like a joke about

00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:45,419
tending to our appt gardens right like

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,759
it is my sound familiar you go through

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,679
your your phone you're swiping around

00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,690
like once every couple months and you're

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,669
like what the hell is this what the hell

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,200
is this don't use this anymore I don't

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:57,000
even know what this is like you know

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,549
gone gone gone and so it's like you have

00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,830
to like weed your garden your app garden

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,840
and and if you look at the stats I mean

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:07,740
it all sort of confirms this the average

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,889
person on a weekly basis they download 0

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,230
apps and if you look at the apps that

00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:16,200
dominate people's time and attention

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,629
it's a handful it's it's a literal

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,669
handful of apps that that you know

00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:22,980
constitute like like eighty percent of

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,500
people's times using their phones so

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,379
it's like it if you want to talk about

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,090
investment and in like barriers to entry

00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:33,149
and stuff like that's really really

00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,669
tough like if you want to compete with

00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:37,559
with with Facebook with them with

00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:41,460
whatever like the other sort of top apps

00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,740
are it's like good luck with that um but

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,200
again like that it's if you have a great

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,379
idea something that that necessitates

00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,210
those device api's and stuff that um you

00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:53,730
know you have to some authentication

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,649
thing that is like oh if we use touch ID

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,000
for this like then we can you know

00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:58,919
create this really seamless experience

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,950
like those are great things to explore

00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,649
so what I often tell people is I say

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,480
like you know think of think of native

00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:07,830
apps as sort of like the ultimate

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,419
progressive enhancement

00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,700
right it's like you could get away with

00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:14,909
a web only experience and be just fine

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,750
the opposite isn't true you can't really

00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:21,179
have like a native only experience and

00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:24,720
not have sort of like a web equivalent

00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:27,179
or a web like a complement to that the

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,860
things like things like uber I guess

00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,549
ours are I think very much in the

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,580
minority as far as like like they can

00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,720
sort of get away with that yeah I think

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,179
it's interesting too because I think

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,820
touch ID and like the fact that now

00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:48,840
password managers are able to do like

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:50,399
extension things on in Safari like that

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,399
is actually cut down the number of apps

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,710
that i installed too because i can use

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,200
touch ID to open up one password to fill

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,539
in the login form in safari so i don't

00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,850
need the app to log me in any more

00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:06,870
rights because login has gotten easier

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:10,169
on the mobile web I now tend to use the

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:14,159
mobile web more than a nap anonym yeah

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:16,350
touch ID is the is the touch thing for

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,600
iPhones right yeah they like fingerprint

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,850
sensor yeah and i think there's similar

00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,480
stuff on android phones and yeah on the

00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:27,510
on the the 5p and or the 5x and the six

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,880
be there is yeah yeah yeah but I just

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:36,980
wasn't sure cuz I've always been an

00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:39,600
Android using voice uh sorry continue oh

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,460
no I I was done I was just saying they

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,929
like it it's made me use the mobile web

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:48,000
even more than a native apps yeah yeah

00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:50,580
persistent log it like I mean login is

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,440
it is huge I mean login login is a huge

00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,380
barrier to people actually using your

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,019
stuff it's like you you know check my

00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,029
email and it's so-and-so wants to

00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:03,269
connect on facebook or so on and it's

00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:04,649
like and it's like I you click the link

00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:06,000
and then it's like you hit the login

00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,159
screen it's like nope don't have time

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,039
for that it's like it is is a huge

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,960
barrier to entry yeah yeah people like

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,029
Luke Wroblewski have been talking about

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,279
this for years like this whole notion of

00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:19,919
like killing the password and just like

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,539
sort of making things like a lot easier

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,100
to just get p

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,440
in the door and using your software

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,080
rather than making them jump through a

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,869
bunch of Hoops so I'm all for that in

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,330
whatever shape that that takes right

00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:34,919
again native apps are great [ __ ] that

00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:39,299
you could have sort of a persistent log

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,129
in there but yeah increasingly that the

00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:47,700
web technology for doing all that is

00:33:41,129 --> 00:33:50,129
getting more sophisticated as well right

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,399
so I know that you've done see if you're

00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:55,019
writing a book um and that's people can

00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,729
actually read parts of the book right or

00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,070
the whole thing all of it yeah I love it

00:33:56,729 --> 00:34:01,769
yeah I'm you talk about atomic design

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,330
what that is excite there's you know

00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:05,369
there's a ton of responsive frameworks

00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,399
out there but but atomic design is more

00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:10,589
of a framework for building your own

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,740
framework kind of I guess is my take on

00:34:10,589 --> 00:34:16,740
it and I I'd say that's a pretty

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,690
accurate portrayal and to sort of I

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,460
guess sort of bridge these two topics

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:26,309
together so sort of how my interest in

00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,589
sort of more modular UI design started

00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:31,589
taking shape was again back in those

00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:34,379
sort of mobile web early responsive

00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:36,270
design days whenever we first started

00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,129
working on responsive projects I sort of

00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,260
like floated in between different teams

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:43,200
as it's more or less like as like a

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,690
consultant that just sort of specialized

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,339
I guess in mobile or whatever so as like

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,929
response to design started catching on

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,480
we started doing a bunch of different

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,569
responsive websites and it was maybe

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,180
like it was like three three teams like

00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,270
in the same week weirdly enough we're

00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,540
like bread how do we do responsive

00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,309
breadcrumb navigation and I'm like

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,750
that's like weird that that three

00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:09,599
different teams are sort of struggling

00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,849
with the same sort of pattern at the

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,470
same time and so I was like well I guess

00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:15,359
that you know I could write this email

00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,000
three different times or I could you

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,460
know have three different meetings or I

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,470
could put together just a couple little

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,540
demos a couple little you know just sort

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,579
of like sketches encode about like some

00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,630
some basic patterns that that they might

00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:33,329
employ to to solve the problem and so

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,369
that went over really really well and I

00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:38,670
was like wow like maybe week

00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:40,769
and I sort of keep doing that and so

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,329
that's what I did is so and that led to

00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:44,940
a project that's called a this is

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:48,509
responsive which is a collection of all

00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,249
these patterns uh for how you know how

00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,809
to make these things work how to make

00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:54,089
you eyes work across all these different

00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:56,190
screen sizes devices environments and

00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:57,809
stuff so we have like carousels

00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,440
different Navigation treatments

00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:03,240
breadcrumbs grids just basic things like

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,680
here's what a responsive image looks

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,630
like you know this list sort of like

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:12,569
squishy image tabs to accordions stuff

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,460
like that forms adjusting their label

00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:17,099
positioning and things like that right

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,769
so the whole idea is here's these sort

00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:21,900
of like grayscale vanilla patterns that

00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:24,180
aren't meant to be necessarily like used

00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,059
but just as proofs of concept right to

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,980
just sort of demonstrate an idea and so

00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:31,829
that worked really really well and and

00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,869
what that necessitated was was starting

00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:36,089
to break things down into its component

00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:38,640
pieces right because it's not about like

00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:40,200
oh how is the home page responsive it's

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,489
like well what's on that homepage that

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:47,549
needs to that needs our consideration

00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:50,910
and so what ended up happening is so

00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:56,430
over the years people started publishing

00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:58,950
their style guides alongside their newly

00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,619
responsive sites so the big one this

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:04,529
sort of like Boston Globe of pattern

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,390
libraries was starbucks com so starbucks

00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:08,249
went responsive like three three and a

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,470
half years ago maybe and whenever they

00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:13,829
release their new site they also

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,779
released alongside a the style guide

00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,880
their pattern library that they're using

00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:19,859
here's like all of our bricks all of our

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,920
component pieces that were using to

00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:24,960
create the new starbucks calm and so

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,940
that was like wow like you know this is

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,700
so cool right they had like little

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,109
patterns like blocks three up and stuff

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,700
like that which are just like three

00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:34,470
little blocks that sit next to each

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:38,430
other and you can resize your browser

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,720
and see how how they react um so more

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,599
and more these things started getting

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:47,540
released I was really really liking them

00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:49,610
and but as much as I love these things

00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,240
I couldn't help but in a lot of cases

00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,920
they sort of felt like sprays of modules

00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,260
it's like okay we get it we're making

00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,520
modules now right and so it's just like

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,130
you know some of them were better

00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,200
organized than others but it was just

00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,970
like everything's of module and I was

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,280
like I feel like there's sort of like

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,380
more of an opportunity to be sort of a

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,750
little more deliberate with how we go

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,450
about making these sort of modular you

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,750
eyes and so that's what led to to what I

00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,680
now call atomic design so what atomic

00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:23,480
design is is this sort of five stage

00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:27,410
methodology for creating your own

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:31,730
interface design system so atomic design

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:35,120
is atoms molecules organisms templates

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:38,390
and pages and they all happen at the

00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,250
same time so sort of like caveat

00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:43,280
everything with that it's not like a

00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:45,610
step one create buttons and then and

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,090
then step 5 create like the final page

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,830
so what I'll sort of if we have time I

00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:55,040
guess it will sort of walk through what

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:59,030
each one of those stages is is that

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,940
he'll for sure okay awesome yeah so so

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:04,070
atoms are the sort of basic building

00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,240
block right so like atoms in nature the

00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,070
basic building blocks of all matter

00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,770
right all matter in the known universe

00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,870
is comprised of this finite set of

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:15,230
atomic elements right hydrogen oxygen

00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:17,690
carbon all that stuff right and so we on

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,850
the web we have that too right we have

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,800
labels we have headings we have image

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,900
tags we have right you get the idea

00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,180
right these things can't be broken down

00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,570
any further right there are basic

00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,190
fundamental Lego bricks um but like

00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,840
atoms in nature they're not terribly

00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,330
useful on their own right they're sort

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,630
of like an abstract concept not not

00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:41,720
exactly you know sort of you can't like

00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,640
actually use them just as is so at the

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,370
molecule stage what we do is we take

00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,550
some of those atoms right like let's say

00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:53,120
a label atom in input atom in a button

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,670
Adam and combine those together into a

00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,970
simple component that I call molecule

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,430
right so simple components now this

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,740
thing that that label Adam too

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,050
lines that input Adam now clicking that

00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,490
button will submit that that form right

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,950
so now you might have like a little like

00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,079
search form molecule kind of thing so

00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,480
it's this like little encapsulated piece

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,660
of you I that you could check in

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,319
anywhere you need search right so then

00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:23,359
the third stage is is what I call

00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:25,369
organisms which are relatively complex

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,619
components so you have your sort of

00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:30,680
search form molecule and search

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:33,020
typically exists on a lot of different

00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,390
experiences in the header right in the

00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,910
site's header so the header organism

00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:40,760
might be comprised of a logo Adam

00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:43,130
primary navigation molecule in a search

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,500
form molecule right we see that like on

00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,079
any go to any website there is going to

00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,290
be like a header that operates as a unit

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,119
as a like a cohesive whole that's what

00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,609
it makes up this this sort of distinct

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,550
chunk of interface right and that's

00:40:55,609 --> 00:41:01,430
represented across all of our interfaces

00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,589
right so so sort of the basic split that

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,420
I've done with the Tomic design is like

00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:08,119
you have molecules which are relatively

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,069
simple components and then organisms

00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,839
which are relatively complex components

00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:14,359
right so there's there's sort of like a

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,160
mode and thinking that's that's maybe a

00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:18,950
little more granular than what we've

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,280
sort of seen in the past um the fourth

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:24,740
stage is the template level so I learned

00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,890
very early on whenever I started doing

00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,750
this with clients that if you keep with

00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:33,770
the whole chemistry analogy they're

00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:35,329
gonna think you're crazy so like all

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,750
right so we need to sort of like a band

00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:39,799
in that metaphor and and sort of go into

00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,829
something that our clients are going to

00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:44,500
understand so so what templates are you

00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:47,780
so now you have these sort of complex

00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,960
organisms the these complex components

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,910
that we now combine those together into

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,740
sort of like a final sort of layout

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,329
right into like an actual layout so you

00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,329
could actually see these things in the

00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:01,760
context of what looks like a page but

00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:04,069
the the trick at the template level is

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,920
that we're more concerned with the

00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:08,900
underlying content structure of the

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,049
components rather than like the final

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:14,570
like you I like design what what content

00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:17,990
is going to be poured into those

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:20,030
hero areas and you know media objects

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,130
and things like that so then at the at

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,830
the page stage that's where we take that

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:28,010
that that template that content skeleton

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:30,710
and then pour real actual stuff into it

00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:33,380
and so obviously that's the best the

00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:35,600
phase that's that's the stage that were

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,340
most used to operating and right it's

00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,080
the most complete thing it's the thing

00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,180
that our users are going to interact

00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,550
with it's the thing your clients and

00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,650
your bosses are going to approve but

00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:48,740
it's also at this stage that we're sort

00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,960
of testing how resilient all those

00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,330
underlying patterns are right what

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,880
happens whenever you pour real content

00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:59,120
in to your designs right into all those

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,750
little bricks do they hold up yes or no

00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,520
does it does it look funky right it do

00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,890
things wrap on to multiple lines

00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,810
awkwardly does functionality break right

00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,640
and and if that's the case then you need

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:14,090
to go back and sort of solve that stuff

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,980
at a more atomic level right but also at

00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:18,130
this page stage what I found is it's

00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,470
really helpful for articulating

00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:24,650
variations in templates so like quick

00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:28,400
example you might let's say you work for

00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:31,730
a bank right the user logs in to their

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,710
banking account they they hit a

00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:37,190
dashboard that shows the recent

00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:39,340
transactions the recent activity and in

00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:43,040
sort of like other sort of stuff right

00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,740
well uh that's all well and good and you

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,810
so you might see ya like a list of your

00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,720
recent activity and stuff like that as a

00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,850
normal user but what if you're a

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,160
first-time user and this is your first

00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,900
time logging into this experience right

00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,180
wouldn't you want to sort of modify the

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,130
UI in some way to sort of you know

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,530
either have like a little welcome widget

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:06,410
or something that's sort of like you

00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,290
know changes that the way that that

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,450
interface is presented are you another

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,220
case is like okay so you're making a

00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,860
blog well what does that blog look like

00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:18,200
whenever you have a youtube video

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,510
embedded in the content of the article

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,120
but what if you don't have one what if

00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,010
you have a table embedded within it what

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,960
if there's 0 comments on that article

00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,470
what if there's a hundred comments right

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,500
so it's all these different sorts

00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,090
scenarios all these environments and

00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,030
sort of variables that we need to take

00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:38,099
into account and our systems need to be

00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,710
resilient enough to sort of you know

00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,119
handle all those situations this is

00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,010
where I think like sort of thinking

00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:46,530
along these lines and especially

00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,090
coupling this with sort of designing in

00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:52,500
the browser and moving this stuff into

00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:55,109
the browser uh faster allows you to you

00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:57,750
know deal with those realities much much

00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,340
sooner he can't do that in Photoshop

00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,619
writer you're just gonna spin your

00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,970
wheels it's like you know so that that's

00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:05,369
what that was always sort of like my

00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:08,070
frustration is that all the Photoshop

00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:10,560
designers would you know create a

00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:11,790
profile page and like the avatar look

00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,010
like it was clipped out of a magazine

00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:17,070
and and of course their name is like

00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:19,200
Sarah Smith and Sarah without an h of

00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,000
course there's like no you know it's

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,880
never going to wrap onto multiple lines

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,710
and stuff like that so so at that page

00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,750
stage what we're really doing is we're

00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,750
sort of stress testing that the system

00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:33,000
of pattern so so collectively yeah so

00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,849
atoms molecules organisms templates and

00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,460
pages sort of collectively form this

00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:40,530
sort of what what's essentially a mental

00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,570
model right so it's it's like you could

00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:45,480
still do your work like the way that

00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,000
you're you know that you're used to like

00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,010
creating a final you I but you're just

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,080
being more deliberate with how you're

00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,970
putting that final you I together right

00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,710
so you're simultaneously creating the

00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:03,480
parts and the whole at the same time

00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:06,150
cool Oh Emma were you to say something I

00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:13,500
thought no just making an interested

00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:15,200
noise as I right now I think it's I

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,089
think it's really cool because it's like

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,760
what you're really talking about is is

00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:22,470
sort of breaking down the problem of UI

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,530
design the way that we talk about

00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:26,880
breaking down you know like on the back

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,580
end or code side of its life the way we

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,500
talk about breaking down like components

00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,180
of our software into smaller more

00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,430
manageable chunks that then talk to each

00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,619
other right etiquette yes very keep

00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:39,300
keeping things dry don't repeat yourself

00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:42,270
the sort of single responsibility

00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,040
principle but yeah like object-oriented

00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:46,170
programming predates the web by a long

00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,900
shot you know so it's like it's just now

00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,870
that this stuff those concepts are

00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,760
starting to bleed out into other areas

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:56,340
we're seeing that with you no more

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,920
modular CSS so what people like Nicole

00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,260
Sullivan and Jonathan Snooks and and

00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,230
Harry Roberts are talking about you know

00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,720
with bem and smacks and OH CSS is like

00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:10,500
that's all you know born of that same

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,390
sort of idea we're seeing modularity

00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,960
bleed out in a lot of different ways you

00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,940
know instead of big monolithic redesigns

00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,830
every three to five years for instead

00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,970
trying to move towards more like sir

00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:27,810
rolling you know iterative updates

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:30,900
instead of having just giant blobs of

00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,760
text in a CMS system as a Karen McGrane

00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,640
calls them you know breaking things down

00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,920
into sort of chunks right reusable sort

00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,050
of content chunks that that you can

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,720
combine in a lot of smart ways using

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:45,090
metadata and stuff like that right so so

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,710
it's like it's across every image of the

00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,480
visual design for that matter of style

00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:50,580
tiles element collages these are

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,330
everything is sort of going in the way

00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:56,670
of sort of modularity and again these

00:47:54,330 --> 00:48:00,030
are these are really nothing new but

00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:01,980
because of the device diversity that we

00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:04,440
have to deal with right we're on the

00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,570
hook for making more stuff providing

00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,090
more features to more users across a

00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:11,730
bunch of different browsers devices

00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:14,880
screen sizes network connections you

00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:17,850
know like device capabilities it's like

00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,030
there's just so much to deal with that

00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:23,340
we need solid ground to stand on and and

00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,990
this this type of thinking this sort of

00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,150
like module like let's take these like

00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:29,850
giant problems and sort of break them

00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,460
down into smaller pieces is I think

00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:35,040
what's what's really making this a very

00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,770
present day problem even though a lot of

00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,870
these concepts are ya like old old as

00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:44,280
hell yes all right we are kind of

00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:49,950
getting a little bit close to time so I

00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,870
think I'll laughs vola will do a little

00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,120
bit of a wrap-up you're going to be

00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,980
speaking at our abstractions conference

00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,359
that's coming up in august

00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,240
so people can come and check you out

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:03,270
there where can people find you online

00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:06,119
yeah so i right uh well I'm writing my

00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:08,520
book at atomic design dot Brad frost

00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,920
calm so you could read all that stuff I

00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,810
just harping on about you can read more

00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,490
about it there if that's interesting i

00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:19,560
blog semi-regularly even despite the

00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:21,060
fact that I'm writing the book uh but

00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,920
yeah that's where I share a lot of my

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,590
thoughts on onto the web design and

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,560
stuff like that um on Brad frost calm

00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:31,350
and I'm pretty much always on Twitter I

00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:34,950
pretty much live on twitter at a Brad

00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:36,840
underscore Frost cool are you gonna be

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:39,390
talking about the same sort of things or

00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,950
your book at abstractions like that's

00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:46,350
like years away I've got much going on

00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:49,080
I'd like I'm like where am i what city

like point well five years away yes yeah

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:58,830
we'll figure that out okay yeah sharing

00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:00,480
that's right but yeah there's a safe bet

00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,609
it's it's a safe bet that I'll talk

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,160
about some some web related things and

00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:07,380
probably some sort of yeah modular

00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,200
related things just because that's been

00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:14,760
uh you what I've been really immersed in

00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:19,260
