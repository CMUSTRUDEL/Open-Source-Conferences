00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,080
people like this is not this is clearly

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,129
not the most important thing that

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,580
happened i started the broadcast because

00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:20,269
i wanted to get talked about the dress

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,150
and the llamas into the pre-show banter

00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:25,980
 address and those llamas

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:28,019
know as a little why was that name why

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,490
was that news I mean I get it like okay

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,480
people's brains interpret colors

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,760
differently whoo it was just it was neat

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,850
is it was astounding to a lot of people

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,210
i mean yeah so it was neat but i don't

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,810
know if it was two whole days of press

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,380
meet you know I meet like yeah I came

00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,960
out of nowhere to it was like I I

00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,940
stepped away from Twitter for like two

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,070
hours and then suddenly every single

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,270
tweet was about some dress and then I

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,710
had to figure out what was going on and

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,090
why it was about the dress yeah and

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,040
stand i missed the llamas thing too I

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,410
guess I was gone for like four hours I

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,580
missed two giant fire hole stories yeah

00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:18,540
I was just trying to get JavaScript

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:24,960
increment a number for four hours for

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:30,450
flowers Hey Ya Ya life is terrible let's

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:35,250
talk about the web turns out it was

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:39,510
caused by so somewhere else a click

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,010
being bound to an entire class that

00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:50,700
cause I am an action to happen way more

00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:53,190
often than I expected ah that's okay but

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,270
yeah the the basis of my problem was in

00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:01,590
ink a number would go from two to four

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,350
instead of two to three oh that's fun

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,290
like the most easy thing you could do

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:11,179
with a computer there's um what's the

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,179
thing about a one-second only thing

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:20,880
I think I might know what you're talking

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:30,540
about and if I don't I have to show you

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:32,070
something too all right find it there

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,320
are only two hard things in computer

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:40,110
science cache invalidation and naming

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:42,980
things which is a which is the original

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,360
quote but then Martin Fowler has a thing

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,620
like on his site it's like a variation

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,330
on this it says that there are two hard

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,160
things in computer science cache

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,310
invalidation naming things and off by

00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:04,080
one errors that's not what I was

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:11,660
thinking oh let me find this there's

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:15,720
some amazing Stack Overflow post where

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:22,080
someone suggests including all of jQuery

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:31,630
just to increment a number i can't find

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:33,100
it though maybe

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,630
an increment number it was something

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,910
really simple that you can just do in

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:48,760
javascript and someone wanted to include

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:51,280
all of jquery just to do it did you see

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:55,030
that power rangers short yes it's

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,040
amazing so good we should talk about

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,310
that for the Today Show I sent that to

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,730
so many friends in a couple group texts

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,910
I really really really want any I don't

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:13,570
know we're um were you still for moms

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,700
when I was talking about um how awesome

00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,350
it would be like the greatest idea would

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,000
be if Michael Bay just directed a mighty

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,470
morphin power rangers movie it's like

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,410
the movie that he was made he was born

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,090
to make that movie it's already just

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,530
back-to-back explosions right like the

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,430
whole show is just back-to-back

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,380
explosions wow it really is so if he

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,140
just made a Power Ranger it would be the

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,540
greatest movie kids ever made I'm

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,370
convinced and I'm trying to like figure

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,640
out a way that I can convince him to try

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,900
and go to sub on entertainment and like

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,860
license the original and it has to be

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,650
the original mighty morphin power

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,250
rangers you should start I eat miss

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,250
galaxy quest started rangers

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,490
dino thunder you know way to any of the

00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,940
new power their recommended to me on

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,030
netflix but this is like massive power

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,880
features recommendation you should start

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,300
kick kick starter that is like raising

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,600
six million dollars to get Michael Bay

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,340
to direct the movie he'll just storm off

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,920
stage like you did that Samsung press

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,170
conference hole that he was like talking

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,490
about ultra HD or something and he just

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,540
like in the middle of the press

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,910
conference he's like I'm sorry I can't

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:31,180
do this and just walks off stage in the

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:33,160
middle of his portion was good hey the

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,810
budget for transformers was a hundred

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,980
and fifty million dollars and so for

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,280
power ranges it's got to be at least

00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,390
three hundred million dollars yeah yeah

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:49,310
so hold on and then

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:54,500
um he hope meal how much did he raise in

00:05:49,310 --> 00:06:00,980
his heart game stupid campaign exploding

00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:04,580
kittens raised eight exploding kittens

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:10,520
has raised nearly 9 million dollars Wow

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:17,390
um so people clearly like the font

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:19,160
exploding things and you know adding in

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:24,050
Michael Bay i think is worth you know

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,810
another 10 x on that number but so

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,920
that's halfway there that's 80 million

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,120
90 million almost so yeah I think I

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:38,530
think you should start a Kickstarter for

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:44,600
uh on six six hundred million dollars

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:46,670
that's your goal until you in the and

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,560
the project is to get Michael Bay to

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,960
make a pirate your smithing yeah so I

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:59,570
should you I'm in I like to start that

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:02,990
right now yep it would be really really

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:07,550
 up if that like ended up being

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,020
like if I met the goal and then like had

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,960
all these negotiations with Michael Bay

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,100
oh how messed up would that be I mean

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,670
since its Kickstarter you really don't

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:24,590
have to deliver so you can just take me

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:26,030
six other million-dollar like I could be

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,620
cool to just like sit down and have

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:33,080
coffee with Michael Bay and just be like

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:35,540
dude what was the deal he do ninja

00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,940
turtles he did the Ninja Turtles wasn't

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,320
let him yeah so that's what I would say

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,330
what was the deal with Ninja Turtles

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,760
yeah I can't talk on that movie cuz

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,380
I haven't seen it me neither I guess

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,490
it's not fair I just heard it's kind of

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:55,640
like really really dumb and like kind of

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:57,710
offensive I think got three of five

00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,310
stars on IMDb Oh

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:12,200
one of five on rotten tomatoes though

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:16,030
mmm that's conflicting yeah I think I

00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,030
have a camera setting on I will like it

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:29,270
original enhanced focus Oh blur out the

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,860
background what are you doing whenever I

00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:42,620
change my camera like that do you see it

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:45,800
live changing yeah yeah creepy gone

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:51,050
original I don't like the way it was

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:54,370
redrawing my face Google's creepy

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:58,490
algorithms to map my face and then

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,550
redraw it as they see fit they're just

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:06,320
trying to make a more beautiful you okay

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:11,480
is that even possible damn it that's on

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,380
video this on video that's gonna be

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:20,150
published to the Internet I'm sorry

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,880
sorry bro no one no one no one watches

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,020
the pre-show stuff anyway just for a man

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,550
I've heard of a couple people tell me

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,320
that they like to pre-show banter more

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,060
like just as much as the podcast what we

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,650
should do is try to a beat it so what we

00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,170
should do is like have people leave

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,880
reviews on both itunes or youtube like

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,490
whichever one they watch it on and then

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,710
see who watches it more because then we

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,450
could like on the production value of

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,660
the pre-show banter it's like a thing of

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,550
you want or not or maybe like make it

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,400
more rustic so it's like less production

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,400
value the pre-show could be you know its

00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:01,250
own show yeah then we'll need a pre-show

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:03,590
for the pre-show yeah um this is what I

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,710
was my one friend sends how much

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,820
hahahahaha for every single holiday it

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,570
says happy President's Day on this one

00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,860
but

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,860
that's the friend that i sent the power

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,550
in jerz video too because he had a mark

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,130
martin luther king day one a President's

00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,680
Day Christmas every holiday he sends it

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,020
a group text that has the power rangers

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:36,930
with whatever holiday it is that's funny

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:41,040
that's good Wow Oh have you seen the sad

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:43,710
server Twitter account no oh yeah I saw

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,420
you retweet it it's it's pretty good I

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,070
think my favorite one is you're pretty

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,450
confident for a guy that just curled

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:53,520
something from the internet and piped it

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,380
to bash which which we kind of all do

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,910
right like I'm pretty sure that every

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,490
development tool that I use on the Mac

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,840
the way that I install it is curl

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,730
something from the internet and pipe it

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,380
to bash like that's how you install brew

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,540
that's how you install our vm that's how

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,570
you install true me I don't know you can

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:14,760
assault Ruby through broo broo now right

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:17,970
yeah I think so yeah pretty sure but uh

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:25,470
oh I'll brew is you know extrapolation

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:28,770
or abstraction that anyway yeah and then

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,210
my other favorite one is uh how do I

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,320
know how do I know that my hardware is

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,480
really real what if it's just

00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,210
hypervisors all the way down having an

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,140
existential crisis here and I was like

00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,780
well let's say you take a ten percent

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,280
performance hit on the hypervisor so the

00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,510
further down you go in the stack the

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,320
closer you get to just infinite

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:48,840
processing power well I think you just

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:55,670
solved all those problems yeah I did I

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,670
did let's say

00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:10,190
I need a pretty penny to get the link to

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:13,160
the show tweet it again make sure people

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:16,400
know about it someone actually asked for

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,470
it in the cousins by IRC room I'm going

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,970

IRC room so it's free it's on freenode

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,410
and it's just code and supply so 3

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,630
straight forward I think you have a link

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,660

really great I use it all the time it uh

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,500
it made it a persister state so that's

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,170
what I really like about it like I'm

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,280

members online yeah everyone on that

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:35,959
list is online yeah it's a little a

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,120
little weird that it the wording they

00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:41,180
chose hey the code and supply podcast

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:46,399
recording starts in 10 minutes so did

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,350
you get a notification yeah excited for

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,509
the Apple watch I can't wait for the and

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:55,279
speaking of Internet of Things when um

00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:58,459
wenzhou come out I think it's May 9th or

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,110
march ninth I don't that's the event i

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,130
think it's March 9th I don't know when

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,009
it comes out it probably won't come out

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,509
to like april or june well i don't know

00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,850
like their be announced it and usually

00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:10,399
when they have a second event they kind

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,759
of like launch the same day so i

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,199
wouldn't be say they have like one or

00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,550
two things that want the same day but

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,389
the main thing that they launch launch

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:23,839
is like a week or so later so if it's

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,730
March 9th I could see the following week

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,529
or two weeks after that being when they

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,910
actually release it yeah I mean I

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,779
certainly won't be surprised if it was

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,009
same

00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:37,490
but I I'm not expecting it anything I

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:40,220
will see how it I don't really want it

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,220
right now but I'm not gonna buy one I

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,769
thought the ipad was ridiculous when the

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,120
grape came out so yeah but I've gone

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,189
back to thinking that the ipad is

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
ridiculous like I own an iPad and now I

00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:53,930
don't use it anymore like I just used my

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,439
macbook air that's true like I don't

00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:00,649
know I was just saying they got me but

00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,269
also yeah I don't I my knife add to my

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,660
mom a while ago and I haven't replaced

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:08,839
it I might buy one for testing whenever

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,389
I you know work with iOS apps but yeah

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,040
the only reason that I haven't gotten

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,439
rid of my ipad is that I think it might

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,629
be useful for development the only the

00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,769
only reason that I still have it because

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:20,629
I thought about like oh I could just

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,790
like give it to somebody you know give

00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:30,110
it to like my brother my mom or somebody

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:34,579
but um yeah I bought a I bought a kindle

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:37,759
fire on a refurbished kindle fire i

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:41,000
think i paid 60 and they're like I think

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,029
new their 80 so I don't know why I even

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,800
did that but I was hoping that I could

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,779
use it for development purposes but

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,569
since it's a refurbished piece of junk

00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,089
it doesn't hold a charge so that's that

00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:58,790
shitty the best i could do is probably

00:16:53,089 --> 00:17:01,579
um maybe put it on the wall and keep it

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:05,299
plugged in all the time oh sweet we have

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:08,689
a back-channel black cannon yeah Lacey

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:11,720
powers watching uh true and he is a

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,819
saying things in the chat room this is

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,480
this is weird it's like people are

00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:21,230
actually watching right now in

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,049
interacting I'd love to have a back

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,089
channel that is always you know full of

00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:29,600
people just saying things then we could

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:34,149
like respond to view your questions and

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,149
all that someday so yeah we'll get there

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:45,669
he says his his iPad also went to his

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,669
mother or like he said that's where my

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:53,289
iPad went to so did he give his ipad to

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:55,240
my mother if he lives very close to my

00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,130
mother so it's very good mom just has

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,330
your mom just gets iPads from all your

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,039
friends and what their hind heads

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:04,299
anymore she's got like a collection oh

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,510
yeah we could do that well we can't do

00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:10,690
that in the Hangout can we can we

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:13,809
there's I think there's ways I don't

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,490
know how to record it um it'll be the

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:18,010
best lower third on the internet because

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,750
week s just the IRC there's ways to

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:24,760
enter to add like you can add qat qat

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,809
you can I mean I guess you're kind of in

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,580
charge of all this I don't know why I'm

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:32,309
looking around at the top well I think

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:40,330
uh oh yeah you I gotta set you as a and

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:42,419
a share control there we go you now have

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:49,409
the same amount of control as I do whoo

00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:49,409
it's very equal in here um control room

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,940
there's there there's ways to add people

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,570
what they're like Google people you know

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:01,799
like you can add Google interactions

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,799
can't add the IRC room or

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,710
well I mean I chart I opened the Q&A

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:24,240
thing I don't know if it doesn't

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:26,910
anything oh man Charles is suggesting

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,590
something that is way harder than I can

00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:33,570
even do right now a video pipeline for

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,950
this overlays is like a desktop screen

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,370
share and you can overlay your video

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:41,809
with IRC as another overlay I could I

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,760
could probably do something like that um

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:48,450
because I downloaded something to try to

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,700
use my DSLR as a webcam oh nice that

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,100
would be sweet basically it was kind of

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,130
BS the way it did it I found some

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,530
tutorial this guy just uses like the

00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,660
remote viewer like you can control the

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,260
DSLR with your camera with your laptop

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:10,620
if it's plugged in USB um the guy just

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:13,020
uh took he just saw kind of made his

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,370
webcam the portion of the screen that

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,070
was showing the preview from the DSLR so

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,440
I don't know if it's even better quality

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,880
it's like price shoots better quality

00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,850
but by the time it gets your computer in

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:34,050
his uh you know in and shown on the

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:35,700
screen it's totally yeah I mean

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,440
we'll get will get better and better i

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,640
mean we actually have real mikes now so

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,750
there's that and we're getting every

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,700
every episode is better than the last

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:47,820
that's that's where we're at oh I bought

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,620
so I'm like I don't really use my iPad

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,300
anymore because I used like my laptop

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,320

used to keep it like that so best one

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:07,950
was hands curler during that eventually

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,590
the company I worked out at the time

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,149
they called me shrapnel because they

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,610
kept like every time they would see me

00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:16,980
they would say some variation of my last

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:20,669
name and I just became shrapnel it's

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:25,860
like no no resemblance for my actual

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:28,440
name I phonetically spelled your name in

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,889
the in the show notes so that I won't

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,889
mess it up

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,550
I'll still mess it up it's all right

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:47,030
yeah I have the Q&A session segment open

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,590

audio and video and I always ask him

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,610
questions he's he's like in the sound of

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,480

with our new microphones it's good it's

00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,660
good we're getting more and more

00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,160
professional every episode so like a

00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:13,360
year from now this will be a

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:16,640
professional company sound booth yeah I

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,360
my goal is to progressively improve yeah

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,720
everything I do yes very slowly it's a

00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,410
good goal I think that's a good goal

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:39,350
incremental mm-hmm you do make mistakes

00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:41,230
and do it again okay um 1059 how uh how

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,920
should we do this Alex what you think

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:49,910
should we start 11 with the intro and

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:52,010
get ready for you guys we think now

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,290
let's give it like five minutes of some

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,050
answer and I just us figuring stuff out

00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,150
and then start whatever we want really I

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,160
mean this is not that's true yeah like

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,260
we can what do you how does a show go

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,200
you edit this later i saw that there's

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,910
like the video feed and then there's the

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,770
audio mmhmm yeah so the hangout is

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:16,090
posted the entire thing is posted

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:20,390
immediately as soon as we're done um

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,850
it's just kind of how it how it works it

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,960
all Jack does that and then um yeah i

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,250
watch the hangouts because they were

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:32,720
really cool and that and afterward I

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:35,110
chopped off the intro and um get rid of

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,000
some of the arms and O's in there and

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,910
then put on youtube or not you to iTunes

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,260
so it sounds a little bit it sounds a

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,580
lot better when ever you remove those

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,240
hesitations

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:51,080
okay well probably and we might actually

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,080
you know stick a like a show inch over a

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,620
song in there this time then someone

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,320
sing a jingle no madam so yeah yeah

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,960
that's that's gonna be part of a

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,240
official intro I think gosh whatever

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,910
I'll just like leave a placeholder for

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:13,130
it yeah la machaca edit and post I think

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,540
if someone said everybody says that and

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,790
everything that I have ever been a part

00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,340
of it never gets fixed or it never gets

00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,320
round in posts like I'll don't worry

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,700
that you just incriminated yourself with

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,060
that last statement will take it out and

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,430
post i'm sure it will be fine and it's

00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,150
the only thing that's in the actual

00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:35,390
podcast thanks for thanks for setting me

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,730
up for disaster but i I've been I've

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,160
been doing this crazy project that I

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,850
call the the fiber project have you

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,670
heard a fiber yeah yeah I doing with it

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:49,400
well it's like okay well people people

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,710
post gigs and they start off with five

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,720
dollars and a lot of them are you know

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,740
weird things like you know my pet will

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,780
hold a sign that says your you know your

00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,970
company's name or your podcast name or

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,200
whatever give them five bucks and I do

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:09,080
it so I had this crazy idea to just like

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,000
use them to build like a short film so

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,480
like the whole thing I'm doing is like

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,150
even the script writing is being done by

00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,530
like five dollar increments on fiber and

00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,770
all I'm doing is trying to orchestrate

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,030
the little bits here and there and

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,130
someone just created a jingle for the

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,760
project a logo for the project they're

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:31,310
creating the lyrics for for a song

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,920
they're doing a two-part dialogue and

00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,020
then people recording them and then a

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,600
puppet is like you know dis cut you know

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:43,490
reading the lyrics back so it's just a

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:46,460
it's been a spin civ experience you know

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,140
because it to make like something for

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,700
fight they only give you a little bit of

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,560
they only give you a little bit for five

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,070
dollars you know they'll write like

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,580
maybe like 20 words or something so I

00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:00,200
keep doing that and eventually

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,630
maybe maybe after I take out a personal

00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,450
loan i'll have like a short film it's

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:10,600
completely constructed by members of

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:12,770
fiber I think that that that's like

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,760
something i'd watch out of morbid

00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,560
curiosity yeah it sounds it sounds kind

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,180
of like a have you ever seen star wars

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,700
uncut where everybody takes like a

00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:26,960
30-second by setting in or whatever and

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,370
then which we had a we had somebody to

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,390
watch that with us that had never seen

00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,280
Star Wars so this is stupid it's

00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,170
actually really funny but you have the

00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,570
floors and cut was painful for me to

00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:41,840
watch I just like my attention span is

00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,880
very low to begin with but it's when I

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,020
say watched it I mean it was on in the

00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,280
background while we were working on

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,590
other stuff like we weren't really

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:54,140
watching it okay we were doing a podcast

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:56,420
you know I'm watching it i right no I

00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,490
think some things are good as a story

00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,140
and not good as in person so that's what

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,300
the fiber projects gonna be I'm hoping

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm just an antidote you know people

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,440
never watch it but they talk about it

00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,480
they're like all you ever see that 15

00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,390
minute film that was created by Brandon

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,890
people across the world on fiber but no

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,040
one actually ever seen it it's got

00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,040
another thing youtube views and just

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:25,250
mean incognito mode on Chrome let's say

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,750
like counts on my that'd be fantastic so

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,550
I've been listening to this podcast that

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,730
I actually Justin turned me on to called

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:35,000
the worst idea of all time yeah so it's

00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:38,840
two guys that watch and review grown ups

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,660
to the movie every week every week for a

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,800
year and I have never seen the movie but

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,840
I am pretty sure that I have

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,130
reconstructed the entire movie in my

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,390
head just from listening and I'm only

00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,950
about halfway through like though the

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:51,890
podcast is actually they finished this

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,850
experiment Wow I'm only about halfway

00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,350
through but I'm pretty sure I've

00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,480
reconstructed the entire movie in my

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,210
head and I just don't ever need to see

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,610
it I don't want to spoil anything I

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,960
don't know I don't know if they

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,640
relational I don't know if they reveal

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,230
us in the last episode or anything but

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,760
we're going to do another season and

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,429
they're gonna do it with sex in the city

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,230
two so oh my god now

00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,690
they're gonna review the they're gonna

00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,960
watch Sex in the City to every week and

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,759
wow yeah I sent them a tweet there was

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,159
something to the effect of you guys

00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,509
should do deep water to next and then I

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,009
put hashtag don't do it save yourself

00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:30,289
deep water to might be the worst movie

00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:36,139
of all time it's also not a comedy it's

00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:39,529
a like a scary movie after that shark

00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:42,200
Senate I did have a shark in it okay but

00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:43,309
it's a buddys country so not gonna spoil

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,809
the movie for anybody but it's a bunch

00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:46,549
of rich people that go on this yacht and

00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,169
then they they go diving off the yacht

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,610
and then they forget to put the ladder

00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,830
down so they can't get back in the boat

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,269
so I'm just floating in the water for an

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,399
hour and a half or however long the

00:30:53,269 --> 00:31:02,169
movie is nothing more relatable than

00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:06,980
rich people on a yacht yeah um anyway

00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:09,139
yeah some people tell me what happened

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,110
what's the ending you got me on uh like

00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:14,960
one person gets back on the boat the

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,029
other people all die okay they can't

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,549
soon return hour and a half well one

00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,590
what somebody gets like stabbed and then

00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:24,169
there's like sorry there is a char to

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,080
the stomach bug look it's nice somebody

00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:30,950
get stabbed by nine um gonna return it

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,950
to redbox now yeah I don't need to watch

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,360
it I mean there was no reason for you to

00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:40,100
watch it in the first place is the movie

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:44,090
it's terrible it's really bad um anyway

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,529
all right maybe we should get before

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,289
this turns into a bad movie review

00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:50,210
podcast I was actually you know all for

00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:53,960
it I think that we should change what

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,549
the codes play podcast is the movie

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,149
reviews are the supply side of code and

00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:04,970
supply yeah well nice all right let me

00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:07,129
go figure out how to do this nicely all

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,700
right I'm gonna do the intro we'll get

00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:14,840
started um just more banter but more

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,059
focused banter all right welcome to the

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,929
Justin Reese here with my co-host

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,990
Alexandra and this month we have ha

00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:45,080
installer and this month our theme is

00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:48,320
the Internet of Things and our guest

00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,020
cons is co-founder of bio bridge and his

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,360
toaster tweets and he's right from right

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,130
here in Pittsburgh so we couldn't have

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,280
had a better guest for the Internet of

00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,900
Things uh so I was thinking Hans we

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,360
could start with maybe a little bit of

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,580
about yourself and who you are and what

00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,880
I Oh bridge is and all that kind of good

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,289
stuff all right oh you know thanks for

00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,700
having me on code and supply I've been

00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:14,750
looking forward to it since you invited

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,870
me on my name is Hans I'm I live here in

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:21,110
Pittsburgh and I did I did start a

00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:25,610
company called I obridge it's we just

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:27,530
started our eighth year so we're people

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:32,750
consider so start up but we've we've

00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:35,690
grown and we've added more more to our

00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,750
technology over the years but we had

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:41,960
this concept eight years ago to hook

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,090
little devices that were kind of they're

00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:48,080
not computers they're just kind of like

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,870
microcontrollers hook them up to an

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,580
Internet service to servers at that

00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,020
point we didn't say cloud and now we

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,820
have to say cloud all the time because

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,780
that's what it's called but we had

00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,610
internet servers running out and these

00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,870
little devices connected back and what

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:10,010
it did what our services did is turn the

00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:13,159
devices into our the web services allow

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:16,129
you to control the devices like through

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:18,889
API commands or web widgets or web calls

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:20,480
or something like that so what you could

00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,210
easily do is turn a scripting language

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,840
into something that controls devices

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:29,119
rather than trying to write embedded

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,280
code I'm not a hardware person my

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,520
partner that I co-founded the company

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Jason Winters was a hardware guy so he

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,060
knew that side I knew the website so we

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,570
combined the two

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:45,500
and that's that's what started our our

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,270
company in the the first years for sure

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,280
we were kind of an experimental phase

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,870
and I still think Internet of Things is

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,970
an experimental phase we were just

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,320
thinking of things to hook to the

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,300
internet we were just trying to be

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,490
clever we were trying to get pressed we

00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,170
were just trying to you know get people

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,950
to see our technology and maybe they

00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:06,110
want to reproduce that in some way and

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,390
you mentioned my toaster so when we

00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,520
started Twitter was new and I thought

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,680
Twitter was kind of ridiculous you know

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,330
at the time now it seems to be this mega

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,820
trend that you know everybody has

00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,250
latched on to but at the time I had no

00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,660
idea what to do and I thought oh you

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,580
know my toaster is going to be on

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,220
Twitter you know and saying nothing and

00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,190
so I said it and then I ended up

00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:30,170
building a toaster that tweeted and sent

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,450
messages and all it does is say toasting

00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:37,550
and done toasting that's all it's ever

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:39,590
said for eight years and the hits got

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,720
thousands and thousands of followers and

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,330
I have like 300 followers so I don't

00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,890
know you know I think I think I think we

00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:50,270
figured out who wins the battle between

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:52,450
man versus machines so that's so we I

00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,250
built that project using our technology

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,680
then it you know got popular and people

00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,360
thought it was you know odd that a

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,820
toaster would want to use the internet

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,140
in some weird way like that but then

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,300
what happened was that we started

00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,650
getting I was going to say phone calls

00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,240
but no one called us what we've got

00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,330
emails and things like that that said

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,480
hey you know we run a laundry service

00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:17,240
you know could you could you make a

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,550
dryer send someone a notification when

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,230
the dryer is done because it's you know

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,400
people want to go shopping while there

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,350
you know they don't want to sit here and

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,590
wait and and then find out it's not

00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:29,060
drying so we we got that phone call a

00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,590
lot and we've got other phone calls that

00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,310
were similar to that and then that

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,960
turned into our kind of our business you

00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,960
know that's what allowed us to hire

00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:42,410
people and grow and start keep keeping

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,070
you know went from a novelty 208 we can

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,110
actually solve some real real problems

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:50,390
that putting sensors and things and

00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,840
reporting their sensor values to the

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,760
internet is not

00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,250
you know is not regulated to just a

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,840
toaster so we started figuring out that

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:00,330
there was a bigger thing going on and

00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,810
then someone were somewhere around 2009

00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,330
someone wrote an article and they on a

00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:09,960
website called read readwriteweb and

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,900
they linked I obridge to this trend

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,760
called the Internet of Things and ever

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,730
since then we've adopted the Internet of

00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Things as a as a phrase you know to

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,350
describe our company prior to that we

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,270
didn't and no one identified themselves

00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,210
as an Internet of Things company prior

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,260
to that and then once that happened

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,260
every company's an Internet of Things

00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,840
company it's kind of unavoidable right

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,020
now but uh it's been fun to see this

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,740
this grow from Oh kind of an infancy to

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,630
i would say we're still still a toddler

00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,710
the industry would be in the internet of

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,330
things there's still a lot to learn

00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,270
there's still a lot of experimentation

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:50,010
and that's why it's fun yeah I

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,580
definitely think that we're like kind of

00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:56,640
on the brink of where this is about to

00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,840
be in everyone's life like and they're

00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,120
gonna they're gonna they're going to

00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,290
know about it a lot more and they're

00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,830
gonna acknowledge it they're going to

00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,990
want it um I got a lot two things that I

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,840
kind of wanted to follow up on like it's

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:14,400
kind of sad that a couple thousand

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:18,660
people are interested in duh what your

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,310
toast is like right now more than some

00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,340
of the things that some other people say

00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:25,530
yeah I am craft my tweets you know I you

00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,050
know snarky is not easy and I like I

00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,390
focus on what I'm gonna write and gonna

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,430
make something awesome to tweet about i

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:36,720
crafted and all my toaster says that

00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:38,580
it's toasting before somehow you know

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,470
much more excited about that but i think

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,140
that it's a little bit telling though

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:46,170
that you know people are interested in

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,700
novelty for sure want to hear about it

00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,470
they're like oh I got to go follow it

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,040
you know I gotta go I gotta follow that

00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,530
and that just becomes and unfortunately

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,180
I've done a lot of interviews and the

00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,880
whole interview was about my toaster

00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,650
I've been on news provement like that

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,880
one Internet of Things is kind of new

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,790
and are like oh tell me about the

00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,120
toaster is it is it a bagel you know

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:13,680
don't do bagels and I'm like yeah it

00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:15,900
does bagels about this revolutionary

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,500
technology that I invented can we go

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,970
back to that or like I is it for slot a

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,640
to slot what are we talking about here

00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:27,870
like oh look luckily for you that's the

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,500
second thing that I kind of got out of

00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,850
that a little bit is um I'm probably not

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,860
gonna be able to contribute as much as

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,410
Alex will today to this show because

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,380
alex is a hardware developer or a

00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:43,170
hardware embedded software developer Wow

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:46,110
which is really cool and like it's a

00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:49,860
completely different world to me and I'm

00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:51,720
really interested in like at a high

00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:55,620
level how you how you bridge that gap

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,750
between scripting languages and the

00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,630
embedded you know writing see on a chip

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,210
and like how does that even how does

00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,550
that work yeah well I think I think you

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,170
have a chance I watched and listened to

00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,470
your other podcast so you were talking

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,000
about pearl and Ruby and nodejs and go

00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:15,030
and all the you know the different

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,710
languages are popping up and you know

00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,810
then you realize that all this the whole

00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,180
embedded world is really see right it's

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,670
whole know there's a lot of abstraction

00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,710
there's some may be a few libraries to

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,800
help you out here there but it's

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:31,140
essentially see and I'm not I'm not I'm

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,150
not in the hardware you know I I didn't

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,040
have that experience it the most i had

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,230
was something called a basic stamp i had

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,240
experience with that you know 15 years

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,900
ago and you know experimented with

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,610
things like that and then then something

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,760
called an arduino came along and that

00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:49,410
kind of simplified a few things but the

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,930
Arduino is hardware and you still have

00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,260
to know programming languages to do that

00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:57,510
yeah what we were trying to do when we

00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,950
were when we created I obridge we were

00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,760
trying to solve something I was trying

00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:05,160
to do what Jason was doing and Jason

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,200
wanted to know about the website and

00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,810
like you know building a simple web page

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,490
for him seemed impossible you know if I

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,560
wrote a perl script that did something

00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:15,120
he was like wow how do you do that and i

00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,430
was looking at what he did and said wow

00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,690
how do you how do you make an LED blink

00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,440
you know on and off

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,790
so we actually that was our problem that

00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,829
we were actually trying to solve it

00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,300
wasn't a lot there was a lot of magic we

00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:30,869
had no idea what it was going to turn

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,470
out to be but we were if I was able to

00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,599
move a servo or a motor or do something

00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,359
on hardware and all I had to do is write

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:41,730
pearl to do it which I was comfortable

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,980
in at the time then that was

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,569
revolutionary to me as a developer

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,930
because all of a sudden I was using i

00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:53,640
was using hardware and at a scripting

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:55,640
level or as at a web service level so

00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,960
that was our that was probably our

00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,650
innovation the innovation ones is that

00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,140
we allowed c programming to happen on

00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:08,480
the fly push firmware over the internet

00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:11,190
or push updates or you know construct a

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,010
series of api calls that change the

00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:17,130
hardware so if you understood how to

00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:20,160
like send a HTTP POST or construct some

00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:22,140
kind of web service call as soon as you

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,880
did that you were moving a servo or you

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,579
were doing something and that's all the

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,609
toaster work the toaster a toaster took

00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,599
an input you know simple like switch

00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:36,480
actually just a like on/off switch and

00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:39,390
we we had an idea back then that we

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,810
could tie like an input into an action

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:46,920
an action or is an event so when this

00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:49,770
happens we it we send a we send a post

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,720
to whatever web service you want so then

00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,790
we created a web service that listen for

00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:57,930
that post and then it interfaces to

00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:59,430
twitter's api and updates twitter so for

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:01,339
me I didn't have to understand the

00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:04,640
hardware side all I had to do is

00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:07,170
understand the once I got our hardware

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,900
connected to the Internet I could

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:12,780
interface with it through web service

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,490
calls and then i can write the web

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,770
service call in any language that I was

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,619
comfortable you know it started off as

00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:22,589
pearl I was happy with that and ruby on

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,990
rails or anything or right now just curl

00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:26,700
you know just taking a prompt out and

00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,010
I'm curling and I'm actually

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,589
manipulating devices and controlling

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,920
them and I don't have to understand the

00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:33,630
hard way

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,910
side so that was that I think that was

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:38,549
our that was the innovation at the time

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:40,260
now that's you know there's hundreds of

00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:43,290
companies that are doing exactly that

00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:48,270
you know that that process there's a lot

00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:50,190
of options now yeah it's um just sort of

00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:53,250
taking a step back it's kind of

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,390
interesting to me um you know we're

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,520
putting sensors and just about

00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:59,369
everything now look like yeah like I

00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,079
think Samsung's got like ovens and

00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:02,520
refrigerators and like all sorts of

00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:04,950
stuff that's got like these computers in

00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,720
them and um I think it's just

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,190
interesting the state of the world and

00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,910
we like you said we're very much in the

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,319
infancy of this sort of period where I

00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:17,190
people are still figuring out wearables

00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:18,420
like I've got a job own thing um but

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,720
people are still figuring this stuff out

00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,369
I think one of these it's very exciting

00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,589
to me is not necessarily the wearable

00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:27,630
market but but the connected home or

00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:29,849
like this idea that you can just put

00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:31,799
sensors in your house somewhere that

00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:35,849
will then be able to like figure stuff

00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:37,020
out about like how you want to uh you

00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:39,510
know it's easy you walk in your living

00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:43,490
room and knows what show to watch or

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:45,809
right or something like that right um I

00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,869
like the idea of being creeped out by

00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:50,579
technology right that's yeah yeah I'd

00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,619
like just violate like I just like

00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:55,049
having my privacy completely violated

00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:57,630
for the sake of convenience yeah i mean

00:44:55,049 --> 00:45:00,089
i like that same exact thing but i like

00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,940
it because i like being lazy and I like

00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:04,530
my home just doing everything for me

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,270
yeah it's like it's like yeah I'm in

00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:09,660
this room of course on what the TV on

00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:13,980
it's our age of course of course why

00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,990
would I have a bag of Doritos why else

00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,780
would I walk into this room with just

00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:21,809
this it figure that out for me it

00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,780
recognizes the Doritos logo on the on

00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:27,150
the bag here's the crinkle and it turns

00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,190
on the TV it's just I love the idea like

00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,319
automating them and I'm holding the sex

00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,349
in a seat you know sex in the city DVD

00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:36,180
you know so obviously knows that yes and

00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,290
then it knows to turn on the webcam and

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,310
all the recording equipment for the

00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,400
podcast that you're about to record

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,050
it knows so but that it's funny that you

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,650
bring you bring this up because it's

00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,480
it's the it's probably the small

00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,430
division i have in what the Internet of

00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,430
Things is all about and what is

00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,440
currently the perception of Internet of

00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,000
Things because I saw it from from its

00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,150
roots so I saw it from a different

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,640
perspective and i also have seen home

00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:08,580
automation systems come up they seem to

00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:12,520
pop up every eight to ten years and they

00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,320
they reintroduce it as a new way so back

00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,410
in the 80s there was some called an x 10

00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,800
x 10 protocol was invented and next 10

00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:23,530
was a way to send information over your

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,350
power network in your house so you could

00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:29,860
send little bits of data between an

00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:32,680
outlet and a switch over the power wires

00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,750
in your house so it's cool technology

00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,670
came out in the 80s but back then

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,380
everybody's like we're gonna have with

00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,850
that technology we're going to be able

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,680
to control your house everything is

00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,900
going to be automated and they went

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,550
through this whole you know branding

00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,040
thing and marketing and every you know

00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:52,060
but it it eventually died off and no one

00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,830
really you know consumers were not

00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,290
wanting that right because it was just

00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:58,750
not what they were expecting plus it was

00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:01,210
it's hard to do it's hard to install

00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:04,030
there's a barrier to entry then it

00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:08,680
happened again with Microsoft in the

00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:10,630
late 90s had a smart smart home concept

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,670
and I don't know if you remember the

00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,890
there was like the smart kitchen and

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,360
they had demo houses showing you you

00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,760
know like things going on in your

00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,220
kitchen in your house and the blinds

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,380
were going up when you walked in and you

00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,900
know as the Sun set changed you know

00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,720
things were going on and so they had

00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:32,770
that and you know it totally died once

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,420
again my fear with Internet of Things

00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,100
pure Internet of Things which I'll try

00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,980
to describe here in a second is that if

00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,530
we attach that concept again to it is

00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,500
not again it will die again and then the

00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:47,350
real the real value of what I OT is

00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,800
going to try that short for internet of

00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:52,670
things but the the true value of IOT you

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,349
may not shine through

00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:59,599
if if all we do is get to that point but

00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:01,430
so let me backtrack a little bit so I

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,829
don't I don't want to I'm not trying to

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:07,130
be controversial on the code supply

00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:08,780
podcast today but um so here's here's

00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,940
what here's how I define Internet of

00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:13,520
Things and then weekend it encompasses

00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,230
the smart home for sure but i think it's

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,790
bigger than that so if you take

00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:20,270
something that allows you to control

00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:23,270
your thermostat right that's like a very

00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:25,849
popular thing like the nest thermostat

00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:27,260
which is often talked about it as the

00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:29,240
internet of things but you think about

00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:32,089
what the nest is the nest is a collects

00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,980
collection of sensors it is a proximity

00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:36,770
sensor tries to figure out if someone's

00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,990
home or not it knows the humidity knows

00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:42,470
the temperature of the current you know

00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:44,540
of the house it tries to figure out your

00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,250
usage pattern so every time you go to

00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,230
adjust the temperature tries to figure

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,970
out you know what do you like the

00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,309
temperature set at right before you go

00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:54,109
to bed and it tries to it automates the

00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:56,210
scheduling which is brilliant righted

00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:57,950
once you have a nest you never you never

00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,480
think about having a nest again you

00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,450
never even open the app you never even

00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:06,049
it just learns the schedule and it does

00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:09,290
exactly what it's supposed to do now is

00:49:06,049 --> 00:49:11,569
that the Internet of Things it's for

00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:13,130
sure possibly possibly that's the

00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:15,829
internet of things but it's just a

00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,599
really awesome awesome thermostat where

00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:21,010
the Internet of Things comes in is when

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:24,530
it starts it starts using other other

00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:26,510
things other services that it has

00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:30,140
available so right now it's just this

00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:32,480
closed system but the nest becomes

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,059
powerful if it was able to communicate

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,980
with your location based services like

00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:39,410
something on your phone that was

00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,329
reporting your position so you can have

00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,640
the best schedule in the world but if

00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:45,650
you're not home why is the air

00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,780
conditioning running why is the you know

00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,150
the furnace running if you're if no one

00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:53,420
in the family is home and your dog keeps

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,160
triggering the motion sensor on it you

00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:56,359
know that's where you take a product

00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,700
where it's like kind of stuck and it's

00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:00,500
it you know and you take that one leap

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,630
over and say okay now it's using

00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,280
position data to figure out whether it's

00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,530
supposed to be on or not that's when you

00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,790
start you start getting into

00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,920
what I see is the Internet of Things

00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,480
which totally describes what what you

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,940
guys were you know talking about is the

00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,680
ideal environment ah how does it know to

00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:19,580
play the movie while it's taking in lots

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:22,520
of data not just not just the the

00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:25,220
temperature in the proximity to the you

00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,620
know to the sensor yes it's uh it's a

00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:32,090
great it's a great time to be a

00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:35,240
statistician i saw a presentation one

00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:36,500
time where somebody said somebody

00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,630
basically made the point that like data

00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,190
scientists are statisticians like that's

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:43,910
what they're doing they're just yeah um

00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:45,770
but uh no no that's totally interesting

00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:48,110
one of my things is I like the I am

00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:51,410
really excited for this for self-driving

00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:54,620
cars but not because of the car like I

00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:56,570
don't the car is an interesting

00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,610
concept but I am way more interested in

00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:00,890
what happens after self-driving cars

00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:02,810
which is that nobody owns a car anymore

00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,950
because you just have like a

00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:06,680
self-driving car and then you've got

00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,570
like smart roads and smart like smart

00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,520
transportation systems built into cities

00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,050
where walk out of an office building in

00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,430
a car comes and picks you up takes you

00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,840
where you need to go and it's like

00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,760
Minority Report you don't have to think

00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,010
about how you're getting there right and

00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,470
you can solve a whole classification of

00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,210
problems by just creating these models

00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,760
about how traffic flows where like maybe

00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,980
we don't need as many parking lots or we

00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,350
don't we can reclaim on atlantic land

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,300
right you can make transportation faster

00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:34,730
we could solve gridlock problems in like

00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,310
new york city or los angeles by having

00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,260
these sort of smart systems where the

00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:41,120
car is talking to the road is talking to

00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:44,300
like the garage that you're going to or

00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,850
the office that you're going to or um so

00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,560
it's definitely not like an inter can

00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:50,660
internet connected thing it's an

00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,400
internet-connected collection of things

00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,440
all talk to each other and figuring

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,770
things out um that's where it gets

00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,020
interesting for me yeah so when you

00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:02,300
start can you disrupt transportation

00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:05,870
because a parking lot knows how many

00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:09,320
parking spaces it has yeah you know an

00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,510
app like Waze is a good example of I

00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,670
wouldn't say it's Internet of Things per

00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:15,890
se but it's it's the idea that if you

00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,500
take a bunch of devices like your cell

00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,699
phones reporting position and then the

00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,069
user is adding

00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:24,209
I'm gonna say metadata I was like is the

00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:27,390
only thing I said I didn't want to say

00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:29,759
today was metadata but I said it I said

00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:32,489
it now I said it twice but you know

00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:34,170
users are reporting data as well like

00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:35,999
they're they're saying that there's a

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,009
slowdown in traffic so you take that

00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:41,400
data and you take map data and you take

00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:43,079
traffic data and then you start the

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,390
collective some of it is is that it gets

00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:49,920
me to where I'm going faster or safer or

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,630
more efficient or yeah all those all

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,579
those different things but it's because

00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:55,170
of the collection that's where it gets

00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,989
interesting for me and you're right

00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:00,719
about the data data analytics side of it

00:52:57,989 --> 00:53:03,479
that's probably the focus of our company

00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:05,430
for the last two years is all about the

00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,890
data analytics like so that's all we've

00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:11,519
been focusing on that's all of the

00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:13,199
infrastructure the api's is to you know

00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,939
figure out you know like what you're

00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,680
getting sensor data sometimes you miss a

00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:19,199
few data points and you want to do data

00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,299
interpolation or you get noisy data and

00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,809
you need to factor out outliers and

00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:27,479
things so all we've been doing is you

00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:30,239
know all is hyperbole but you know all

00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:32,009
we've been doing is focusing on the

00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,499
analytics and making that easier because

00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:36,539
that's you have to be able to process

00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:39,420
the data and you have to be able to come

00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:42,989
up with you know should I turn on the TV

00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:46,650
because Justin walked in the room yeah

00:53:42,989 --> 00:53:48,119
yes so it's definitely I see the

00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,459
difference you're making it being about

00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:53,369
the communication between the devices

00:53:50,459 --> 00:53:56,670
rather than like you know that the nest

00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:59,519
being one solo device that's really good

00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,199
at the turf like being smart and the

00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,059
software is kind of was making it smart

00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,670
but do you think that maybe we're kind

00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:07,769
of like do you think that the connected

00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,689
home thing will die out again or like

00:54:07,769 --> 00:54:10,949
yeah are you in or do you think we're on

00:54:09,689 --> 00:54:13,589
the I feel like we're on the brink

00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:17,279
because I'm seeing a lot more things

00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:21,119
that are kind of actually communicating

00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:24,539
with each other I at one of the show

00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,150
links i have is a the Luna Luna mattress

00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:29,729
cover yeah um and what that does it's it

00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,559
knows when you're in bed so as soon as

00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:32,790
you get in bed it you know adjust your

00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,010
thermostat

00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:37,800
it dims your lights and it locks your

00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:40,770
door with these connections to other

00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,830
other services it's using nest and

00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:46,530
perlite lockitron and beep I don't know

00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:50,940
what beep does um but are you swearing

00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:54,120
and censoring yourself no no no like oh

00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,660
this has gotten seriously nice know

00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:59,910
whenever I censor myself I say bleep ok

00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,920
this is this another make sure beep I'm

00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:05,070
not sure what that one does but you know

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,230
it's using all these it's using its own

00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:09,960
sensors but then it's also communicating

00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:12,390
which is the really interesting part UV

00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,550
yeah so I think you made the caveat that

00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,260
I do agree with so to answer your first

00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:19,200
part will it die off in its current

00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,360
state where you have single device where

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,750
you know you have an app for everything

00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,730
around your house on your phone you know

00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,980
so if you want to control something oh

00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,660
where is my washer app and I open my

00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,180
washer app where's my garage door app

00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,070
where is this and then those things are

00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:37,350
going to get stitched together by

00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:40,470
services you know there'll be one app

00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,030
for all of those devices so but I still

00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,670
have to run one app and get into each

00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,900
individual discrete component and then

00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,570
there will be a phase where we start

00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,370
scripting automation between the

00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,950
platforms because the app will kind of

00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:56,580
bring it together or api's will bring it

00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:59,790
together so what I disagree with is is

00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:03,300
that people themselves are going to go

00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:07,260
to the store and continue to buy this

00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:10,650
stuff and just want to buy it for they

00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,450
need a reason and I don't know that's

00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,640
been the hard part for this industry

00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,760
probably for 30 years is what is the

00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:21,090
reason for me to go buy something or

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,590
does it happen slowly over time like

00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:24,330
it's happening right now and then you

00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,770
just look around your house and then

00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:28,080
everything's connected and you're like

00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:30,180
oh how did this happen it's because you

00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,180
you bought the thermostat one day you

00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,480
bought the mattress topper the next day

00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:38,220
and you know it's like but it's a slow

00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,600
it's a slow progression and then all of

00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:42,330
a sudden these things are interconnected

00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:45,690
and you have that aha moment that oh I

00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:47,820
can put these things together yeah

00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:49,560
that's where it's going yeah I

00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,730
definitely I agree with what you're

00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,970
saying is going to happen slowly over

00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:55,050
time I think the difference now between

00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:56,970
the last couple times this has happened

00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,790
is it's also cheaper to do this stuff so

00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:03,870
like Samsung can put a chip in it in the

00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:06,740
in their oven at a far lower cost and

00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:09,090
they could have 20 years ago oh yeah so

00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:12,030
it's easier to sort of slide under the

00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:14,160
radar and and you know you buy a stove

00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,990
and you're like oh well it's also got

00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,970
you know it's ten dollars or whatever

00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,500
from the other one and it's all it's got

00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:21,000
you know this thing right and there

00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,770
won't even be an option in a couple of

00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,630
years because a few years from now there

00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:27,360
will not even be something that's not

00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:29,640
have this option yeah but they're

00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,290
definitely has to be value value to the

00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,250
consumer to right so the one of the

00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:34,230
things that I think is interesting is

00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:36,000
that the nest thermostat is amazing

00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:37,560
they've done a really good job of like

00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,830
marketing it and people to buy it love

00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,600
it and there's a very clear um there's a

00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:44,280
very clear reason to buy it right if you

00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,900
pay this much for your thermostat you

00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:49,020
will save this much on average and

00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:52,020
electrical and you can sort of juxtapose

00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:54,150
that with the nest protect the smoke

00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,470
alarm which is what is it like a hundred

00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:58,260
twenty dollars hundred thirty dollars

00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:01,710
but the 15-dollar smoke alarm that i

00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:05,160
bought at walmart does exactly the same

00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:08,670
thing and is you know 10 a tenth the

00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,350
cost yeah so you've got to kind of find

00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:13,440
that balance where like the extra cost

00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:15,390
is worth it and it will it will be very

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,750
slow over time as people just sort of

00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,040
slowly adopt things I think something

00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,730
that I see that's different this

00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,490
iteration is um the ubiquity of

00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:29,990
smartphones and the software being a

00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:32,880
more sophisticated this time like like

00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:36,060
smart the iphone is like a gateway drug

00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,290
to spending because you get it and then

00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,980
you see all these cool things you can do

00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:42,660
with it like connecting your nest and

00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,780
controlling your the temperature in your

00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:48,120
house with your phone and I think that's

00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:50,040
part of the convincing being done

00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,960
already is people are just drawn in by

00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,080
this cool thing and they have they have

00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,970
part of the system already and it's mine

00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,760
it's almost like it was like a missing

00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:03,270
piece or the old smart connected

00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,180
before um I don't know general changing

00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:09,390
the missing piece is there's still a

00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:11,880
missing piece which is that there's this

00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:13,770
missing hub that controls all this stuff

00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,270
and so apples got like their home kit

00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:17,790
thing and I haven't really looked at

00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:18,990
what it does or how it works but like

00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:20,880
there's this missing thing of like

00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,310
you've got all these devices but there's

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,460
no way to really talk to all of them

00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:29,250
because everybody started creating their

00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:31,950
own proprietary API so that only their

00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:34,110
devices can talk to their own devices so

00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:36,330
like there's this missing piece of like

00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:37,800
this collection or this hub where you

00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:39,750
can get all these devices and have them

00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,570
talk to each other in some uniform way

00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:44,670
and I don't know maybe home kit or

00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:47,520
that's why I does anybody remember the

00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:50,400
Android at home demo from sure yeah like

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,810
disruptive two years ago it was awesome

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,550
and then it just sort of went away like

00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:56,310
it just died you know it was kind of

00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:58,800
like a Google TV well though I guess now

00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:00,990
it became Android TV but Google TV did

00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,840
the same thing and it just sort of died

01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:08,010
after a while like it went away and then

01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:09,980
now Google created Android TV to just I

01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:14,910
which is the same product just rebranded

01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:16,470
um but I think that's that's interesting

01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:21,690
that this sort of thing comes up a lot

01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:23,010
and then nobody uh like nobody sort of

01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,970
notices that it dies out and then it

01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:27,000
comes back again and everything's

01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:28,650
excited and it dies out again so um we

01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,790
go we have a question from the chat room

01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:32,220
and this kind of was where I was going

01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,840
to go next but Hans you can probably

01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:38,280
answer this a lot better than either

01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:43,860
islets are I um but the the protocols

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:46,530
between devices I how has that how has

01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:49,920
that evolved um someone's asking

01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:54,360
specifically Z where Z Wave verse x10

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:57,110
first GE proprietary thing um so like

01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:59,460
you would it be how is that all how is

01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:02,220
there it does seem like they're probably

01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,830
is no standard right now right that's so

01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:08,100
yeah yeah you're everybody is hit on

01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:10,290
this uh this kind of area Alex said

01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,480
there's no hub and there's no uniformity

01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:15,119
how do i connect everything you're

01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,550
your chat question is asking essentially

01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,170
the same you know same thing so there's

01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:23,040
a lot of protocols there's lots of ways

01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:24,600
for devices to connect but you have you

01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,000
have different challenges with devices

01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:32,400
so we can you have a smartphone and

01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,410
everything you know smartphones perfect

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,680
it's got a UI it's got a battery it's

01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:39,210
got network connectivity and you're like

01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,220
okay well we'll just put a smartphone

01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:42,869
and a thermostat and now we've got a you

01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:45,270
know the smart connected thermostat

01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:48,210
which is great you can do that it costs

01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:50,240
a lot of money to do that for those

01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:52,770
individual devices so what people

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,510
thought okay how do we put a hundreds of

01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:55,980
sensors in your house and make that cost

01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,300
effective so then they start at

01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,260
something very basic like a

01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:02,910
microcontroller it's just got a simple

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,730
processor on it it's got a you know

01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:08,100
control or a you know a loop that just

01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:09,750
runs in a loop forever it does a set of

01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,310
instructions and that's all it does and

01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,650
it just you power it up and it does

01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,540
whatever that loop is you know I'll

01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:18,030
measure this temperature and i'll send

01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,369
it over the wire every 10 seconds that's

01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,200
what I'll do for the rest of time so you

01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:24,930
have this constraint of like well then

01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,550
how do I power that microcontroller you

01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:30,720
know so I have to put a battery on it or

01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:32,970
plug it in the wall and so should I run

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,000
Wi-Fi on it well Wi-Fi requires a bigger

01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:37,859
stack and requires a bigger ship and

01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,410
then 25 a bigger chip I have to have a

01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:43,770
more of a dedicated power solution and

01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:46,260
so you keep running into those how do i

01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:47,369
connect it back and so then you go okay

01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,650
well let's invent a new wireless

01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:51,240
technique that's lower power so we can

01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,950
run it off batteries for the next five

01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,230
years and you're not replacing batteries

01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,090
in your house every few months like

01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,820
you're changing clocks every six months

01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:05,940
you know your your uh if I can't really

01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:07,800
creeped out right now it was like the

01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:09,690
oddest like two minutes of my life I

01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:13,140
don't know what you were doing Justin

01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:16,050
but is it's really funny so I that won't

01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:21,480
make it to the audio part but uh Justin

01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:23,160
was doing something very sinister if you

01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,250
wanna know the truth I got really

01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:28,690
distracted by a bunch of ear outside

01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,820
yeah you were here talking about your

01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,710
short extension you know sort attention

01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,780
span and I thought squirrels will

01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:38,190
distract Justin and then it turns out it

01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:40,780
was an animal that's lutely like I

01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:43,510
forgot you're on video so you're like me

01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:48,130
you kept leaning forward and your eyes

01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:50,500
got all shifty you were wondering what

01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:53,350
was going on I was like I need to

01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:55,030
address this because I really was not

01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,560
gonna say anything you just hope that

01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:59,890
somebody would say something in the chat

01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:03,070
room but I realize how evident it was oh

01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:07,410
it was but it was also very slow and

01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:09,910
very creepy yeah yeah exactly like that

01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:12,970
I'm already you can't move fast

01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:17,320
otherwise you'll scare the deer yeah

01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:18,550
your freshman Google's kenster we

01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,730
wouldn't want to do that during the

01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:25,090
podcast um I'll whisper can i whisper

01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:29,560
whisper yes fish yeah so what happened

01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:31,600
over time was is this people invented

01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,850
you know new ways to connect things

01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,620
because they had other constraints you

01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:37,000
know so then distance became in a

01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,700
constraint you're like okay well if I

01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,890
have a Wi-Fi router you know gateway

01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,930
sitting up on a shelf somewhere how do i

01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:46,300
connect the whole home now like well

01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:49,390
like you know it gets really about 150

01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:51,850
feet so they invent new ways to do it

01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:54,520
and then if you jack up the power then

01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:57,940
you need more power you know jack up the

01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:00,460
you know the Wi-Fi you know power now I

01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:03,250
need a bigger battery or different power

01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,540
supply and so all these constraints have

01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:05,950
happened that's what that's what's

01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:09,550
happened and everybody comes up with a

01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:10,960
new way that they think it's better and

01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,420
then people have to either pick that

01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,760
protocol or pick that standard and then

01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:17,860
try something new or invent something

01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,510
but the whole the whole name of the game

01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:21,820
is right now we're in a phase where

01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:24,730
there isn't a wireless or a connectivity

01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:28,030
technology that says everything can just

01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:30,310
use this and it solves every case so

01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,590
like a door lock as a good example a

01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:35,080
door lock is asleep most of the time

01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:36,940
right if if you think about it how often

01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,950
are you opening and closing your front

01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,210
door you're not doing it very often so

01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:41,040
if

01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:43,619
going to put a if you're going to put

01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,750
some technology in there that relies on

01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:47,280
some power source well how do what you

01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,619
know how do I put power in there okay

01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,750
well batteries make sense then I'm going

01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:53,760
to put you know some form of wireless

01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:56,520
but though it can sleep and it only

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,190
needs to really wake up when I either

01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,369
you know jiggle the handle or I do

01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:04,560
something to wake it up or you know or

01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:06,060
it wakes up every 15 minutes on its own

01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,420
just to check if it's supposed to do

01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:10,830
something or you know whatever I push a

01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,170
button to wake it up so there's all

01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:15,690
kinds of weird power you know should I

01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,950
be on should I be sleeping and you also

01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:19,410
can't be running around changing

01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:21,599
batteries all day long and you know and

01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:23,790
when you go to you something you find

01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,770
out that the flashlights dead which is

01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:28,670
the common everybody's got a flashlight

01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:31,410
but it's dead when you go to use it

01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:33,089
that's the same kind of problem that

01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:36,330
happens so a lot of protocols get

01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:38,730
invented to to solve some of these

01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:40,920
issues so then you get interoperability

01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:43,170
issues you get two things speaking two

01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,330
different protocols and they don't they

01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:47,880
don't inherently work together right

01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:50,070
away so there is a phase right now in

01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:53,400
IOT i should say is that there is a hub

01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:55,920
phase right now if you've gone the CES

01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:58,859
have heard about ces the Consumer

01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,770
Electronics Show the year before this

01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:04,830
year it was all about the hub and these

01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:07,109
hubs had multiple you know it could

01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:10,170
connect over Ethernet it connect over

01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:13,099
Wi-Fi had zigbee z-wave and others you

01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:17,460
know proprietary wireless radios in it

01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:18,900
all in one hub so two years ago was all

01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,980
about the hub and there were so many

01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:24,180
hubs at CES everybody had their version

01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:25,920
because that they're trying to address

01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,300
the same thing where this question came

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,880
up with how do I get these things to

01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:32,609
talk if they can talk back to a hub I

01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:34,560
can convert zigbee in the z-wave I can

01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:37,910
allow the door lock that's on you know

01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:43,050
z-wave to communicate with a sensor

01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:45,510
that's using zigbee yes so I just sort

01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:47,910
of quick answer and then maybe we'll

01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:49,830
move on to another topic lazy powers

01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:52,109
asking is anybody working together to

01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,490
make these standards iterate to make a

01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,900
stain

01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:56,360
and iterate on it or is it just going to

01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,460
be the Wild West for the next decade do

01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,740
you think uh I think it's gonna be the

01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:02,180
Wild West all right but there's a ten

01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,910
percent part of it saying that there are

01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:09,140
people trying to make it work together

01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:11,360
but oh yeah I um do we want to where we

01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,430
have left we've got a privacy and

01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,430
security yeah I mean that kind of leads

01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:19,580
right right into a privacy and security

01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:21,980
for me um like if there's no standard I

01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:24,319
feel like the people implementing these

01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,600
are going to try try to make it kind of

01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,940
as easy as possible to talk to these

01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,580
devices so that they don't have to worry

01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:36,380
about security and privacy is much

01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:39,290
security so much so uh I realized that I

01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,600
have you know voluntarily three cameras

01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,100
pointed at me at all times whenever I'm

01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,279
in my living room I have it I have a

01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:49,009
security camera canary that's connected

01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,900
to the Internet I have connect for my

01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:53,450
xbox connected to the Internet always on

01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:56,120
and i have my macbook FaceTime camera

01:08:53,450 --> 01:09:00,009
which is supposedly not connected to the

01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:04,730
internet unless I tell it to um but but

01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:06,410
like if if there's no standard what what

01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:09,529
is the security like in this world right

01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:11,480
now uh yeah so that you're hitting on

01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:13,819
probably that I mean these are the

01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:17,029
biggest the biggest issue security and

01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:19,310
privacy and they are different but so I

01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:22,100
I host the Internet of Things Pittsburgh

01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:23,990
meet up and we usually meet over at the

01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,490
tech shop every few months so I'll

01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:27,890
invite you guys over to that if you want

01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:30,640
to check it out yeah definitely in the

01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:33,980
meetup we have some standing topics and

01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,630
security and privacy or topics we bring

01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,790
up in every meet up and so what I

01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:40,910
usually do is like I'll bring the latest

01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:43,009
news or the latest happenings in those

01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:45,350
two areas and then we start a group

01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:47,660
discussion around them because they have

01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:49,069
to be considered every time when you're

01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,589
when you're talking about Internet of

01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:54,440
Things because that we're going to run

01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:57,560
this fine line between are we giving up

01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,990
too much to gain some features around

01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:02,390
the house what are they doing with all

01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,980
the data that's collected you know with

01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,969
all of these internet connected things

01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:09,360
not just image data but just

01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:11,039
general sensor data is is this is justin

01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,630
home right now is something you can

01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,610
answer if you have a nest thermostat i

01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:18,210
know that there's an API call I can

01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:19,920
figure out okay is someone home and nest

01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:22,880
will give me that answer based on all

01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,010
the sensor data it has at that moment so

01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,340
does that matter maybe not but that's

01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:31,590
it's definitely something to consider

01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:33,599
what I asked in the dancer security

01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:36,719
first what I asked in the meetup is I

01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:41,460
asked you know what what what version of

01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:43,349
firmware is running on your refrigerator

01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:45,539
that's like the the question I usually

01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:49,280
pose you know because someone will talk

01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:52,079
about you know my my refrigerator has

01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,940
what their you know has weather forecast

01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,590
on it so when i'm at the refrigerator i

01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:58,139
see that it's going to be cloudy today

01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:59,760
or whatever i'm like okay what what

01:10:58,139 --> 01:11:02,400
version of firmware is it running now i

01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,769
got i have no idea what software is

01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,219
running on it and that's the first issue

01:11:04,769 --> 01:11:10,590
with security is that we kind of know we

01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:11,999
need to update computers right you you

01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:14,070
may have cell phones you may have

01:11:11,999 --> 01:11:16,229
android or iphone you may have like a

01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,300
list of those little notification tags

01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:21,119
are saying you've got like seven apps to

01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,829
update you know are they all dated do

01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,110
you need to update them or they security

01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:27,900
flaws you know so you kind of know you

01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:30,059
keep your phone up to date but does the

01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,469
does everybody know that everything

01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:34,349
around your house is also running

01:11:31,469 --> 01:11:36,630
software now that how do you know what

01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:39,479
version is it and what's what is the

01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:40,590
upgrade path does the company push the

01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:43,019
upgrade down because it's

01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:44,429
internet-connected do i opted into it

01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:46,309
though i have to sign in the app do i

01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:48,900
have to know the version so i have to be

01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:51,900
monitoring blogs to find out if there's

01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:55,070
security flaws in my refrigerator that i

01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:58,349
need to you know upgrade so right now

01:11:55,070 --> 01:12:00,659
it's not clear that people update their

01:11:58,349 --> 01:12:02,489
phones that regularly so now how am I

01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:05,429
gonna update everything around my house

01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:07,860
and what's the mechanism updated do i

01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:09,960
plug it into a USB Drive do I put an SD

01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:12,840
card in it too I hit a button on a

01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,030
website to update it is it automatic

01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,489
does the automatic cause

01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:19,270
interoperability issues or outages or do

01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:22,870
I brick it when I update

01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:26,470
wrong or you know so security right now

01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:29,080
is a big one because we don't know what

01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:31,630
software is running so there's that I

01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:33,580
don't know what it did to my network to

01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:35,860
make it work that I open up ports on my

01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:38,650
firewall that I disable firewall that I

01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:41,470
disable you know plug-and-play to what

01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:44,380
what did I upnp what did I do to get it

01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:46,030
to work in the first place and does it

01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,650
always come down to username and

01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:49,270
password you know kind of look at a

01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:51,940
video feed just because I know a

01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:53,770
username and password you know or you

01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:55,240
leave your phone at a restaurant and

01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:57,130
someone unlocks it and then all of a

01:12:55,240 --> 01:13:00,070
sudden none of the apps need to be

01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:01,720
signed into yes I can post something to

01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:03,280
your Facebook but now I can open up your

01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,950
garage door because I unlocked your

01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,680
phone you know that's that's like a very

01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:11,500
so security is a major major major

01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,960
concern hair yeah I read that so two

01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,040
things that I'll just sort of bring up

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,750
along this line is that i read an

01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,250
article a while ago that was just like

01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:23,200
the Internet of Things is often insecure

01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:25,240
and unpatch abul so like there's a lot

01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,950
of devices where there's some insecurity

01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:29,920
but there's no way to actually patch the

01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:32,670
insecurity so um and this is pretty

01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,410
dangerous when you're talking about like

01:13:32,670 --> 01:13:36,670
connected locks or you know things like

01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,260
that where somebody now can just break

01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:40,450
into your apartment because there's a

01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:42,700
security vulnerability on the lock and

01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,590
the other thing just to touch on like

01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:47,050
username and passwords this is actually

01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:49,420
a problem that I I use 1password which

01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:52,300
is kind of a good password generation

01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:54,850
and remember like David cool Thomas I

01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:58,450
use 1password no no no no I use the

01:13:54,850 --> 01:14:01,120
pottery 11 password too soon we'll guess

01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:02,800
i don't--all ever guess that um but

01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,570
you're clever does everybody remember

01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,950
the whole thing with mat Honan a couple

01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,900
years ago where his twitter got hacked

01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:11,080
and then all of a sudden they got they

01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:12,820
got his iCloud they got ya his apple ID

01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,040
his Amazon account they got everything

01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,990
right I mean he wrote a brilliant piece

01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,610
about like the history of the passwords

01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,900
and how passwords don't protect you at

01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,790
all and like they're always going to be

01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,650
crackable and you know so what you have

01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:25,240
to do is have different passwords I mean

01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:27,490
he wrote a follow-up article to that a

01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,870
little while later maybe six to seven

01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,420
months later or maybe was like eat here

01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:32,370
later that was handling identity on the

01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,740
internet

01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:35,790
and so the problem is there is that you

01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:38,430
have to come up with something that is

01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:40,020
super easy for people to do where they

01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:43,020
don't have to like think about it too

01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:47,430
hard but it also has to be incredibly

01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:49,260
accurate and unfortunally that's a

01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:51,990
really really really hard problem to

01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:54,870
solve because how do you make it easy

01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:56,760
and then also incredibly secure um yeah

01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:58,230
inconvenient right it has to be

01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,630
convenient because people aren't gonna

01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:03,210
make you know 60 character passwords

01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:06,720
that are all you know a bunch of a bunch

01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:09,000
of characters um and that's a really

01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:12,090
really really tough problem and I don't

01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,510
know that we have any sort of solution

01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:17,460
on the horizon for that I definitely

01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:20,280
like I believe we're kind of in the era

01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:22,860
where you kind of just should almost

01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,860
assume that your identity is being

01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:29,790
stolen right now because they yeah the

01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:31,470
idea of identity on the internet is so

01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,120
loose like it's basically what your

01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:36,380
password is your yard entities your

01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:39,300
password so proving that you're you is

01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:41,940
kind of hard not I almost think that

01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:46,320
companies should kind of appreciate that

01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:50,550
and understand that that um we shouldn't

01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,890
allow for you know a authentication to

01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:56,400
equal identity otherwise like we're

01:15:52,890 --> 01:16:00,480
gonna get into just more of this you

01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,670
know engineering our way into people's

01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,070
lot to being people until we have a

01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:07,890
better solution right so you almost need

01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:10,410
like a statistical model of like a and

01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:11,940
this was kind of the point that i'm mat

01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:14,850
Honan was making in his article was that

01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:17,400
you kind of need you need to know with a

01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:19,380
certain degree of certainty who somebody

01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,810
is so the same way that like I know that

01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,880
you're Justin by like how you look what

01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,610
like we we have history together so like

01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,410
I know you know I know where you've

01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:30,660
worked I know like what your interests

01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,250
are you know because we're friends and

01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,720
so I know who you are your computer

01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:35,820
almost has to have the same sort of

01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:38,040
statistical like model of who you are

01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,870
and your identity um which was kind of

01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:42,960
the point that he was making and that is

01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:45,690
really difficult to do right like you

01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,260
can't you need more than one so we have

01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:47,520
to factor

01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,910
authentication we have a password and a

01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:55,050
coded sent to my phone right but we

01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:56,610
almost need like a dozen factors but

01:16:55,050 --> 01:17:00,510
that are all really easy to sort of

01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:02,640
correlate yeah well so there's I think

01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:04,080
they're all the research that I see in

01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,380
this area is like trying to identify

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,870
people based on patterns and based on

01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,450
what they're doing so the phone is an

01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:14,580
obvious one obviously you know Apple

01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:16,110
added sensors they added the you know

01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,550
the thumbprint and things like that

01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:19,080
they're trying to identify the user

01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:21,450
because you can get into someone's phone

01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:23,850
you also now get into the payment

01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:25,410
systems you get in you know there's a

01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:27,030
financial side but now there's this

01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:29,160
physical side right Internet of Things

01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:32,160
is very physical garage doors and home

01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:34,290
automation and sensors very physical so

01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:36,300
once you're in that space you know

01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:38,070
people can understand you you get into

01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,650
my facebook and you say something crazy

01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:42,210
on my facebook that's one thing but if

01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:45,330
you're using it to like get into my

01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:48,030
house that's like I think people get

01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:50,040
online it's yes it's scary especially in

01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:52,500
you know people's heads they can see

01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:55,470
that so the research is definitely in

01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:57,120
identifying the person so you know and

01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,310
have you been holding this phone for a

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,930
while you know what's the gate of your

01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:03,750
walk you know because i have an

01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:05,520
accelerometer that's like you know when

01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,660
you hold it how far off the ground or

01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,000
you're holding it is it the same

01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:10,830
distance you're always you know you know

01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,290
those kind of things where are you when

01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:15,870
you're doing this where what place are

01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,670
you at so i think a lot of it is like

01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:19,200
you said like there needs to be 12 point

01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:21,810
authentication i think a lot of them are

01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,960
going to come passively really phone has

01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:28,710
a lot of idea that this is alex this is

01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:31,170
justin using the phone yeah and so and

01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,490
this is kind of interesting to this

01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,650
isn't really internet of things but it's

01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:37,020
kind of something that I still I think

01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:39,540
it's so making things cuz everything is

01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:41,970
internet right every company's IOT yeah

01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:44,130
um what I really want and I've Justin I

01:18:41,970 --> 01:18:46,680
know you've heard me say this a bunch of

01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:49,530
times is I want my country mystery yeah

01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:51,330
yeah I want my computer to understand

01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:52,650
and this is like a kind of an example of

01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:54,090
where I want to go but I want my

01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:56,250
computer to understand that if I have

01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:59,910
like a meeting like if I have a business

01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:03,300
trip in China next week that it

01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:05,220
good find a flight find a hotel find a

01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,870
taxi like pine a hotel that's like sort

01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:09,750
of equidistant between the airport or

01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:11,100
and wherever I'm going or like like it

01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,450
should figure all that stuff out present

01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,000
me with an itinerary and I can just say

01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:16,980
yes and like buy everything that i need

01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,080
to buy and it like has access to my bank

01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,670
account so it knows that it's like it

01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,990
knows where to where to charge it or it

01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:24,300
knows that it's a business expense and

01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:26,040
it should you know bill my my expense

01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,990
account or something and I want stuff

01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:31,320
like that but in if you're gonna do that

01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:33,480
before you can make like the charge for

01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:36,390
for that kind of expense you have to be

01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:38,910
fairly certain that you're talking about

01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:40,920
the right person right like you have to

01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,720
be incredibly sure that I'm the one

01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:46,200
authorizing it and not somebody else I

01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:48,660
think that you know Hans got appointed

01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,760
to this but you know things can kind of

01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:53,700
almost provide the framework for that

01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,740
authentication yeah yeah okay Justin

01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:59,250
drove his car home opened his garage

01:19:55,740 --> 01:20:01,800
door and he's in his living room buying

01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:04,320
this so that's him like we know that Sam

01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:06,630
yes yeah attracting this path all the

01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,240
way and he's he's done everything with

01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:11,790
his stuff and now he's where he normally

01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:14,130
buys things were like ninety-eight

01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:16,830
percent sure it's him yes someone yes

01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:18,840
took his place in some well and it's

01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:20,910
also the same height as him and yeah

01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,280
watch the same way it talks the same way

01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:25,920
or um I think that's where all the

01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,810
research is going right now but the the

01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,670
other part is you got to get product on

01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,590
the shelf you know some people are

01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:33,180
sidestepping these things there are

01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:35,790
refrigerators out there that using

01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:37,710
embedded Linux and there's known

01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:39,060
exploits for those embedded Linux and as

01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:41,640
soon as they were out on the market

01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:43,650
people were putting advertisements on

01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,720
refrigerators you know there that

01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:48,030
happened like two weeks after their

01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:51,360
release you know so there's there is a

01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:52,980
race to get products out there and and

01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,660
then it consumer buys them and then they

01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:57,480
get that experience and then they're

01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:59,970
inundated with you know media telling us

01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,860
you know what's going to happen so

01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:03,390
that's why that the growth of it is

01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,600
going to be stifled unless these things

01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:10,620
are kind of addressed ahead of time

01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:13,080
because they're not the you know you

01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,800
take the you take the real you take the

01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,890
real benefit

01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:19,290
vaio t and you kind of throw them away

01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:21,510
and like you said a benefit of IOT could

01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:23,640
be payment processing really could be

01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:26,340
yeah it's you know it's this whole

01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,110
collection of an environmental data that

01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:32,160
says yep this is Alex making this

01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:34,320
purchase right now yeah and I feel very

01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,820
confident about authorizing it because

01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,360
of all of these things that have

01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:43,950
happened to this point and that could be

01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:46,860
a side value of IOT yeah that we throw

01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:49,200
away because we do it wrong you know we

01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:51,180
really release it no one buys into the

01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,490
idea of collective intelligence no one

01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:55,320
you know because they're like oh they're

01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:57,900
monitoring me they're doing this they're

01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:00,180
doing that but for a bank it's obvious

01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:02,070
you know if they have less fraudulent

01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:04,920
transactions they have higher profit

01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:06,720
margins it's very simple you know you

01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:12,540
know they want to solve this problem in

01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:15,900
a genuine commercial way so that's

01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:18,020
that's the that's the issue yep do we

01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:20,640
solve what do we give up by calling it

01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,250
home automation and just getting product

01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:26,790
out there and just getting things that

01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:30,750
are inherently uh I'm gonna tell a bad

01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:32,940
story for IOT just from the get-go yeah

01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:35,370
for sure that's like the first time of

01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:37,980
her someone to talk about the banking

01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:40,140
industry in a positive manner like they

01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,730
think they should they could lead us to

01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:45,420
this you know authentication and

01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:49,200
everything but well if you can get past

01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:51,180
all the regulations that are you know in

01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,430
that industry that's that's one of those

01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:55,170
industries that's like there was I was

01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:56,490
watching a couple of years ago I was

01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,780
watching this thing on TechCrunch where

01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:59,430
they were talking about all these health

01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,750
startups and startup trying to break

01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:02,850
into the health field and it's just a

01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:04,260
complete pain in the ass because they

01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:06,510
have to navigate these complicated

01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:09,270
regulations that most people don't even

01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:11,400
know or understand and so they have to

01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:13,200
hire like like the first thing a health

01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,550
startup has to do is hire this like

01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,070
lawyer that understands health

01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:19,230
regulations because yeah otherwise there

01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:21,150
is the same thing with if you make a

01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:23,340
medical device that's connected you have

01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:25,470
to go through that same process so I

01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:27,159
mean there's great ideas that you know

01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:28,900
we got contacted all the time but you

01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:31,269
start up so be like oh we're gonna make

01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:33,309
a glucose you know sensor it's gonna

01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:35,289
measure blood we're going to update it

01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:37,119
you know share it with doctors and maybe

01:23:35,289 --> 01:23:39,459
they can share with friends on Facebook

01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:41,260
and you know and i'm like you know as

01:23:39,459 --> 01:23:42,699
soon as you start going into that great

01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:44,320
they're all great ideas they're going to

01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:45,999
happen you know things are going to be

01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:49,150
in the medical space is going to get

01:23:45,999 --> 01:23:50,829
disrupted by a iot n but the regulation

01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:53,499
it's going to be tough them you know

01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:55,389
plus they're going to deal with to the

01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:57,519
problem is is then you know you release

01:23:55,389 --> 01:24:00,699
refrigerators got security flaws in it

01:23:57,519 --> 01:24:02,949
and that sets a bad tone for things that

01:24:00,699 --> 01:24:05,199
are legitimate legitimate that they're

01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:07,239
trying to do an area that we were

01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:08,889
involved in the beginning you know that

01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:11,919
years and years ago this is probably six

01:24:08,889 --> 01:24:15,010
years ago was in sleep sleep apnea

01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:18,939
machines these CPAP machines that like

01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:20,619
provide you no pressure to you know

01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:23,619
allow that person to breathe

01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:26,010
continuously through the night and it

01:24:23,619 --> 01:24:30,400
turns out that those machines get out of

01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:32,289
spec pretty easily and so that they need

01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,809
to be set to a certain pressure and then

01:24:32,289 --> 01:24:36,429
that pressure kind of like gets you know

01:24:34,809 --> 01:24:40,570
it gets to the point where it's not

01:24:36,429 --> 01:24:42,579
actually solving your apnea issues but

01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,900
no one like gets them regular maintained

01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:45,610
and things like that so here's an

01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,619
example where you put a sensor in there

01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:49,869
you might measure the pressure you

01:24:47,619 --> 01:24:51,760
report the pressure on a daily basis and

01:24:49,869 --> 01:24:55,030
you all you see the decline in the

01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,829
Machine someone goes out adjust the

01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:58,090
machine or replaces the machine and now

01:24:56,829 --> 01:24:59,769
you have something that does actually

01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:03,400
save your life in the event that you

01:24:59,769 --> 01:25:05,380
stop breathing in the night so and then

01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,209
conversely what happens is people also

01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,369
started to realize that people didn't

01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:10,749
use their CPAP machines that was another

01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:13,539
thing that was being reported by these

01:25:10,749 --> 01:25:15,039
early sensors and they cost you know

01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:16,630
five six thousand dollars that were

01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,090
subsidized by your insurance and

01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:20,979
insurance is like okay well you have

01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:23,739
this machine for six months you didn't

01:25:20,979 --> 01:25:25,449
use it send it back we can use it you

01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:26,709
know and you're like way no no you gave

01:25:25,449 --> 01:25:28,239
me that machine and you're like well

01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:30,699
you're not using that machine you know

01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:33,070
so it's you get into a weird interplay

01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:35,229
right from the get-go between insurance

01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:37,059
between the industry and all you're

01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:39,309
trying to do is solve a basic thing that

01:25:37,059 --> 01:25:41,590
you initially want to make sure that

01:25:39,309 --> 01:25:44,320
they have the pressure that they need to

01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,360
save them if they stop breathing and

01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,000
then you find out that you know if

01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:50,710
they're using it or not and then then

01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,080
you know then other people want to get

01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:55,210
access to that data you know to get the

01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:56,830
machine back or give you a different

01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,719
solution if you're not going to use the

01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:01,599
machine so there's very innocent side

01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,400
then there's also you know a side that

01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:06,340
says okay now we're monitoring are you

01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:07,960
using this machine yeah does your

01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:09,670
employer need to know if you're using

01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:12,429
that machine or not and they can say

01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:14,860
okay well he's risky now because they

01:26:12,429 --> 01:26:16,810
don't use their prescribe you know so it

01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:20,230
gets into this very strange interplay

01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:21,280
between that's the privacy side of some

01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:25,239
of those questions that are going to

01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:27,190
come up is like how how do we have walls

01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:29,199
between who gets what data how do we

01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:32,380
control access to it what's being done

01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:36,340
with your usage data is it important for

01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:37,810
nest to know everybody's pattern of when

01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:39,639
they come home and when they don't are

01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:41,170
they sharing that data they using it for

01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:43,750
advertising are they going to use it for

01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:46,480
marketing are they going to anonymize it

01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:48,730
publish the result you know results so

01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:55,179
those are those are questions they're

01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:56,860
coming up um yeah I uh and there's

01:26:55,179 --> 01:26:58,840
nothing to be some new new things that

01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:03,520
we don't even know about you know that

01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:06,429
our privacy concerns um but yeah that's

01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,869
so that's out there and that like it's

01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:11,530
just setting yourself for this new world

01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:14,290
that we don't know about yeah um yeah I

01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:16,150
think the we had some really great

01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:20,560
conversations say but it's probably time

01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:25,000
to wrap it up um yeah if uh let's uh

01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:27,369
maybe go through Alex you anything to

01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,780
add to the conversation for the end uh

01:27:27,369 --> 01:27:30,429
no I mean this has been a great

01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:32,980
conversation I think we've sort of

01:27:30,429 --> 01:27:34,960
touched on a lot of stuff in this sort

01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:37,900
of like industry that's still kind of

01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,960
you know in its infancy or as Khan said

01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:42,369
like and it's like toddler see stages at

01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,650
pics that's a word that I could just

01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:46,389
make up right now are using emphasis it

01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:48,099
with Han said it so now I got to be the

01:27:46,389 --> 01:27:50,679
guy that takes ownership of that word

01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:53,260
okay all right off the balcony bitter

01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:54,160
it's gonna take off and you'll get all

01:27:53,260 --> 01:28:01,740
the credit

01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:04,000
yeah I'll change right now yeah yeah um

01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:06,850
so now I mean this has been a great

01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,650
conversation I'll just plug my website

01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:10,960
Alex you know calm and my Twitter

01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:14,470
account a dalek shenoy and then that's

01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,940
all I got Hans how about you you want to

01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:19,570
wrap it up you got anything to share

01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:22,660
they would say yeah i'll talk about a

01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:24,820
few things to wrap up internet of things

01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:27,610
like it like I couldn't have said it

01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:30,550
better Alex uh it's in its infancy or

01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:32,500
toddler is the stage I think it's early

01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:35,140
and it's cool that we're experimenting

01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,000
and I think and people were actually

01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:39,040
talking about it in these kind of forums

01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,650
because it's I think it is it's

01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:43,450
important if some of the concerns come

01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:46,120
out early maybe we have a chance to

01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:48,190
adjust it if you want it if you're in

01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:52,600
Pittsburgh and you want to learn more

01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:56,710
there is a IOT meet up that we meet a

01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:59,140
tech shop they donate the space if other

01:28:56,710 --> 01:29:00,790
places have you know places that donate

01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:03,730
will take the space but we usually get

01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:07,780
between 30 and 60 people there's almost

01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:09,700
200 members now that our meeting where

01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:11,560
every every time we meet we're talking

01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:13,630
about security and privacy what's the

01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,660
latest trends we get an open discussions

01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:18,010
we have someone do a demo or someone

01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:20,320
from the industry give a presentation

01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:22,930
about what they're working on so that's

01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:25,600
been that's been really successful in

01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:30,580
starting the conversation and in

01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:34,120
Pittsburgh for sure so there's that in

01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:36,040
its IOT PGH is the if you search for

01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,600
that you'll find the meetup there's a

01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:41,620
you know there's Twitter and all that

01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:44,740
stuff for that as far as I I keep a blog

01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:47,670
I talk about IOT I talk about all kinds

01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:51,490
of what I'm working on things like that

01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:56,740
and it's a tumblr blog and the website

01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:58,570
is not Hans com so n 0 th ANS calm and I

01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:01,360
always say cos Hanscomb was taken so

01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:03,040
this is not Hans calm and you can you

01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,530
can go there and I write about all kinds

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,020
of things that is interesting to me but

01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:10,780
typically IOT based

01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:13,120
so and thanks Alex and Justin for having

01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:14,980
me on yeah no thanks for coming on and

01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:18,760
being available and this is a great

01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:20,440
great conversation yeah and uh neither

01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:24,130
of you guys plugged your Twitter handles

01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:28,360
so I will hold well actually I'd mine

01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:29,710
did okay halogen boy Hans I forget how

01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,150
to spell your last name but it's your

01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:35,260
last name so you want to spoil it for

01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:38,590
people yeah it's at Charlotte CH AR le

01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:42,010
are great and I'm at just the next Reese

01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:46,810
um I don't have anything to plug I is

01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:52,600
the X cam for x-ray vision it's actually

01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:56,110
a reference to David X Cohen oh yeah

01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:58,720
each aroma oh yeah very where yeah he he

01:30:56,110 --> 01:31:00,070
wanted to use the david s cone but he

01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,320
couldn't because there wasn't already a

01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:04,150
david patten you're in the Screen Actors

01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,160
Guild you have to have everybody has to

01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:10,200
have a unique name in the guild yeah

01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:12,130
yeah so I uh stole that idea from him oh

01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,770
ok I was wondering if that was a

01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:17,710
reference of futurama hey futurama

01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:20,500
didn't come up and now it did yeah I was

01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:23,380
like okay it should have come up Alex I

01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:25,390
drawer quoting futurama too so yeah you

01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:27,820
you'll see us on Twitter go back and
