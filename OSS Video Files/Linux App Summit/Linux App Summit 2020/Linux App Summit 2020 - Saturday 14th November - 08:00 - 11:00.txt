outside of china almost uh everyone have

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
have

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,040
heard of ubuntu killing

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,680
thank you

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
and the

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
in fact from the name and the logo we

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,680
can say

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,840
that the uber locating and the ubuntu

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,840
have a very close relationship

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,120
umanukiri is our official of ubuntu

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
and is the first situation is thirteen

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
and

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,080
four the killing literally

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,160
means a mystical creature in chinese

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:26,880
legendary there is a saying that

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,880
killing places brings peace

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
prosperity

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,639
and by now we have released

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,759
16 versions over 13 million downloads

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,800
on our official website and i have

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
heard the various open source events in

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,319
over

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,319
13 cities are close to the country

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
we have contributed many committees to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,800
open source code

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,800
to new

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,960
also some anti-funds other is great

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
because we allow to hurt from everyone

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,840
and the uk ui is a short name of ubuntu

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,840
keying ui

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,199
ukui is the default desktop environment

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
in ubuntu key that has been ported to

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,520
some

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:54,240
other distributions such as the arc

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,960
fedora openola and so on

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,120
unless this turbo environment can attack

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,160
the more people to use it

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,479
and have more energy to push us to

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
create a better software

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,280
ecosystem

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
and started the flow

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,319
2013 we have

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,080
been shows two major changes until now

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,599
in the beginning we saw that

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,319
you need desktop environment with ubuntu

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,680
by providing a small amount of

00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,919
customization as more and more

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,919
customizations

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
were requested modifying unity was no

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,680
longer

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:51,039
enough to meet our needs anymore

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,680
so we focused the intel made this turbo

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
environment

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,599
and did a lot of custom reliation

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:03,280
the resulted show in the middle finger

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,479
and during that period many people say

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:12,560
generation of ukraine is very similar

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:15,520
to wind 7 way or the mind but

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
this is a change we made according to a

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,080
lot of

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,280
customer feedback so the quantity of

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,560
wind 7 like is that

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,639
most of the original

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,479
windows user come migrated to ubuntu key

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:38,000
more easier and

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,760
as time goes by more and more gojs

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,159
desktops appears and we also wanted to

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,839
make a more beautiful one

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,680
we all we also have some desktop related

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,320
technology accumulation so we started

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,240
to try to develop a disturbable

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,240
environment

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
independently

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,959
thus uk ui 3.0 waterfall

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,399
and the new uki is whiten in qt

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,600
which makes the overall style a bit more

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
gorgeous

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
and makes it easy to attack the more

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
developers

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
to participants in the development of

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,480
open hearing

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:36,000
since there are more qt developers

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:38,560
certain gdk developers in china

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
uqi are the healing to the desired

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,880
philosophies

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,920
of easy excellent

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,120
expert error bullet and

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,240
it provides you with a more present

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,440
interactive experience the

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,720
slider shows our latest design of

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,760
uqi 3.1 which has

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,399
been changed to around the corners and

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,399
suppose multiple switching

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,360
and this is the architecture of ukui 3.0

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,279
we have many rewards the core desktop

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,880
lawyer

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,240
such as the menu the panel

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,880
the peony which is the file manager of

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:37,440
ok ui and the other servers

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:41,120
like power manager sitting demo

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
decision manager and so on

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:49,040
and we also develop some

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,320
level developers some libraries such as

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,880
upi interface killing stdk

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,880
and the qd5 scene

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,160
and now we are mainly based on qt

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
in the kf5

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:15,839
just like the slight issues

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,079
and we are also moving forward with the

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,959
development of a table model model

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,320
to support the increasing number of

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
touch device

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,839
available today

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:46,000
and after release of ukui3 just a way as

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,200
we predicted when the

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,320
desktop environment to a

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,120
central extent users started

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
to confirm more about the application

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,279
ecosystem

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
and the question is like well i don't

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,680
have a web chat

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
the chinese communications of the world

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,040
like skype

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,560
why can't i trade stalkers and so on

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,760
were asked a lot by the user therefore

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,200
we put a lot of

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:24,000
effort to accelerate advancing

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:27,440
our software ecosystem

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,720
are some applications developed by us

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,000
including keying assistant

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,079
to help real system information and the

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
system settings

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,320
eating screenshots to provide the

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,519
regular screenshots

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,760
and additionally support a real-time

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,560
editing function

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:53,920
any scanner cleaning burner and so on

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,000
we now have a special team to customize

00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,399
the most urgent needs of youth

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
focusing on developing more greater

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,839
tools

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,839
in the future

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
apparently the power of a single team is

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
always

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,839
small and we are also actively

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
looking for partners

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,040
at the same time we are also actively

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
promoting third-party

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,079
manufacturers to adapt their

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,360
applications to ubuntu killing

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,199
such as the radio portal application

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:05,440
yoko the 13

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:09,279
sixteen three hundred and existing blues

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,480
machinery downloader you down directory

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:17,839
and so on power the most of the

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,839
application field

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,040
and for some manufacturers neither the

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,639
application have a linux situation

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,199
not cooperate with us we have found some

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
other ways to make them run on ubuntu

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,040
killing

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
such as where electron technology

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,880
and in the future we launched the

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:59,839
recharge in the qq which

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:59,839
haven't as a new situation

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,440
along with the change of uk ui 2 to ubi3

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,279
we also migrated from jdk to qt

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,320
and we used the qt to rewrite

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,000
the right main desktop components

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,079
but not all of them were rewritten

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
and the applications also have the

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,800
problem of

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,759
unified developing tools

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,360
that makes the entire desktop looks

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,120
confusing

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
so we needed a way to unify the style of

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,839
each component

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,839
and the applications

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,000
first we use the qd5 gtk2

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:55,199
printful thing a protein data unifies

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
qt and the gdk applications into the jdk

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,959
style

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
but the actual result is far from our

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,000
destination

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,959
so we first prioritized

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
unifying the style of the components in

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,000
the applications

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,279
developed by qt then modified

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,920
the gdk sync for gdk applications

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,920
to make them look the same as the qt

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
applications

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,519
just as the future is used purely

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,880
security application

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,240
uk ui panel the jdk component

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,440
and the wps the qt application

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,040
on the qdfi gtk2

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,199
platform scene it looks that there is

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,160
no harmony when improving the

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
applications

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,079
and the components together because of

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,079
various styles

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,199
in order to solve the problem we created

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
a project

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,520
called the qd5ui printful scene

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,640
which is the initial essentially a

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,559
qpa platform plugin and

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:23,360
similar similar to kde plasma

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,360
integration plus freezer

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,600
incubified uk ui printful scene we

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,640
provided

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,600
both qd5 ukui style

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
which is a customer style used to guide

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,360
the

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,160
application in making style but

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,400
adjustment

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,600
on ukui and the framework

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,640
for managing qt application styles

00:17:45,600 --> 00:18:01,200
the slider shows the standard method

00:17:48,640 --> 00:18:05,840
for implementing qpa plugin

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,840
just inherited the class

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:15,840
and begins to use this

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:27,760
and we set the style name to ukui

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,799
thus we request a custom style named

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,240
ukri

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,679
and then set the qt qpa

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,720
plain form theme to ukui when ukui

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,880
session

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,360
launches the desktop environment so

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,840
if where did the such as the kill push

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,840
pattern

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,600
doesn't set the spells himself it will

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,840
use the spell where they get

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,840
they registered

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,440
and the data collected the offers

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,559
several configuration of

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,640
options which we can view

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,200
will command show in the

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
slides

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,240
of course for general use there is no

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
need

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,640
to set the settings directly

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,600
as the control

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,640
the control center the pane of the test

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,640
bar

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,960
provide a graphic interface to help us

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,559
to control the overall style of the

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,840
desktop

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,360
and for developers the same blue game

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,200
provides a set of

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:57,520
apis key object

00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,200
properties as a broad as a protocol

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,080
and with those we can easily implement

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,360
some features that are not available in

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,799
your scene

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,960
such as making icon highlighted

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,960
in her dragon the jump

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,240
and this is architecture of qd5

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,679
ukulele printful scene the core part

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:35,840
of the mainline cross style and the

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,840
plentiful scene

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,679
which will respectfully provide the same

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,679
font i can say

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,039
or pro

00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:03,840
windows manager picture animation

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,840
and so on

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,919
you just like the grid and the fusion

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,960
other way added the ability of

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,640
customize the animation and

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,640
add the highlighter effect

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,600
most thing will try a different style

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
for selected

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,120
collected stairs when dealing with the

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,520
control styles

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,679
usually modify the best color border

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
and the different themes have different

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,480
styles of

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,520
management such as fusion is the

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,640
selected

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:59,840
cube pushing pattern

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,840
is the best color changes

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,280
yeah i will show demo later

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,840
and the code is in the project

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,840
in github

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,520
okay let's continue

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,960
in the for cue push button we have not

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,240
only changed

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,440
the base color and the font color

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,360
added the animators but also changes

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,720
the color of the icon to avoid the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:47,840
problem of icons and the backgrounds

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,840
getting mixed up and being in

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
disgraceful

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,480
and for icons made up of a variety of

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,840
colors

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,960
the highlighting protector rely on the

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:23,840
hue color the king code is

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:23,840
shown in just

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,880
in the will show a demo

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,840
wait a moment i will switch to my screen

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,279
can you see it

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:38,000
with a highlight so the icon

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,000
goes more clearly

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,840
okay let's continue

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,640
and the animation are an important part

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,840
of the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,640
virtual experience and the smooth

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,080
animations elevate the desktop

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,720
environment

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,080
now we have our implementer animations

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,440
for wedges

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,880
for wedges like a kill push button

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,600
kill two apart kill screw bar kill table

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
wedges

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,480
and so on here

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,640
we focused on kill tablewedge is a

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,679
page leaper animation we bring the

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,799
tlg tablewage instance with

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,919
table which is default slide

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
slider animator in purifier you can use

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:57,840
that

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:57,840
polish function

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,360
and the one pure table wedge is a

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,320
switches

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:25,840
with a synchronous connector changes

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:25,840
we monitor the signal

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
is the signal

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,120
we monitor this signal and uh when the

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,159
signal is available

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,559
our qr data will show on the cure stack

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,880
to the widget which

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,279
is the carrier of the entire animation

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,559
to complete the animation of the kill

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,840
table widget

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,840
we need to get the free picks up

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
the grill picks up

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
of the previous keyword is the

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,640
screenshot

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,360
from killstreak lawyer at the right

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
time and we need to get the next pixel

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,520
map

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,679
of the next keywords screenshot

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:44,799
as well and when the animation is over

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:49,840
we hide the curiosity that is our

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,840
table widget animation

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:17,840
and whereas your demo too let's decide

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:17,840
on my screen

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
me

00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
nope

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,159
i can't switch back

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,840
can you kill me

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,840
oh okay

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,760
and this is our desktop

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,799
effect so far we can see that

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,480
security application in the top left

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,720
is a pioneer and the gtk application in

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,919
the middle screen

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,279
the cardiac and the other components

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,279
such as the panel

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,640
and under the side sidebar

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:20,320
looks consistent in scenes

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,440
of course the stream isn't the perfect

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,440
and we will continue to explore

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,279
a better way to keep the style

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,120
consistent across

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:47,840
our application and

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:47,840
yeah i will show you a demo too

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,320
you see we switched

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:29,840
the scene from black to white

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:29,840
and the pro looks smooth

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
okay and

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,200
here are some of our links for

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,840
more detailed information and just

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,840
feel free to join the obviously

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
community

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:11,840
that's all thank you very much

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,600
thank you so much sorry about the

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,279
complication midway through it looks

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,640
like we have a question

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,679
a couple questions for you on um

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,840
the shared notes if you'd like i can

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
read them out to you

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,799
okay the first question is what is the

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,840
plan

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,840
of tablet mode of uk ui 3.0

00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,440
and about the

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,440
ring of tablet mode

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,480
we now are developing it

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:11,760
and i think maybe

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:20,800
next year

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:23,760
we we will push the alpha vision

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,720
okay the next question is how many

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,800
themes

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,599
of cute five uh i'm going to butcher

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,040
this

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,240
um uk ui platform

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,079
theme is there on uk

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,200
ui desktop platform

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:46,800
and now we have our three things uh

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,639
the proxy the white light scene

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,639
and and mix the scene

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,839
yeah that's all okay

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,079
the last question we have are you

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,599
planning to use flat pack

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,560
if so are you going to add the flat hub

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,560
repository

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,079
in fact we have we ever

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,440
developed the flat tab and i

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,480
i post i submitted

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,480
some com

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,040
i have a joint of welfare development

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,480
last year or several years ago but

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,839
now we have no plan to use it

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,599
we now have uh focused on the

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,000
snap because of our flavor for

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,480
ubuntu we are more more careful for

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
just me

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,960
it looks like we had one last question

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,119
pop up in the public chat

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,520
for future reference please put

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,240
questions in the shared notes

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,800
the question is how does ukui compare

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,280
with

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
dpin

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:15,599
i see

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,680
because we are all developed to use

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,880
cutify

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,079
and uh many things are similar

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,640
in the first we are all beautiful

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,640
we are beautiful i think in the

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,359
butter

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,520
let's see

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,240
they are more cons concerned about the

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,240
they are more concerned about the beauty

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,160
but we are more

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,359
focused on the stable

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,560
i think this is the difference

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,560
stable in the beauty

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,440
all right that looks like that's all the

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,240
questions we have

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,680
um so thank you thank you very very much

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,200
for your wonderful presentation

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,440
thank you thank you thank you everyone

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,240
thank you okay

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,839
it looks like we will be taking a short

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,839
10 minute recess

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,599
and will return with an open source app

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,040
funding talk

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:51,839
coming up at a quarter pa or quarter two

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:51,839
the next hour

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,000
hello and welcome back everyone i am

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,280

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,040
our schedule today and

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,079
up next we have manuel giving us

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:11,839
floss funding manuel

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:11,839
please welcome to the stage

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,599
hi good morning or evening wherever you

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,599
are

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,440
okay so

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,440
i'm manuel genovese

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,880
i'm a racist developer and artist

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,160
i'm going to talk about open source

00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,559
funding

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:43,680
today you might know me as i am the

00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:48,559
apostrophe maintainer and

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,559
i'm a foundation and foundation member

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,319
but who i am not i'm not a

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,880
non-representative nor a lawyer nor an

00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,000
economist this will be an issue with my

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,079
points of view

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,079
so take it with a grain of salt

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,079
now before i speak i'm gonna talk about

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,359
app funding

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,920
being that we are you know sub summit

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,160
desktop funding and libraries funding

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,800
are just as important

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,760
the stocks are the base of our the user

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,680
experience

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,520
and libraries are at the core of

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,559
everything but to have

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,599
all these missing apps

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,720
we need to we need to find everything

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,680
you cannot have a same ecosystem if the

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,880
base is

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,800
not well maintained and suddenly

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,240
libraries are not the best well funded

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
thing in the world

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:49,359
for example we all remember what

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,839
happened with openssl open ssl was under

00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,880
fun

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:53,359
and undermanned time yet two-thirds of

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,079
the

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:57,599
websites at the time depend on it heart

00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
bleed but the world

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,240
the whole internet in a whole but also

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,119
put the issue of libraries

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,079
funding on the spot sadly library

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,160
funding is a

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,839
quite complex topic and i won't have

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,920
time to discuss it today

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,920
so let's talk about apps

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,000
now money is the world as we know it

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,200
you want to eat to life to exist you

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,680
need money

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,880
that is you for open source developers

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,440
because as we all know

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,800
open source doesn't give a lot of money

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,359
or better for us

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,720
it doesn't give a lot of money of money

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:37,119
to open source develop

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,119
because companies profit a lot from it

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,319
when i say a lot

00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:48,000
i mean see the case of netflix

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:51,040
netflix report a 20 billion usd

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,119
dollars revenue and our 2 billion

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,200
on income in 2019.

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,480
netflix is a company that heavily

00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,520
depends on python

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,200
at this at his core there are lots

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,839
and lots of python yet python only made

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,040
three million dollars in revenue and

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,480
half a million

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,599
i think in the same year

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,800
netflix funds

00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:22,240
python netflix is in the

00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,720
donor half of fame of python

00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,599
yet there are another companies like

00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,720
spotify

00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,079
or amazon who also depends on python yet

00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,240
they don't fund it

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,720
or less not publicly

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,040
that means that people usually end skip

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
giving up on projects in favor of

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,960
more profitable day jobs this is the

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,079
frequency

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,800
graph of my commit sun apostrophe

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,000
this empty zone is when i was hired by a

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,400
big company to the

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,119
to work i didn't love to be honest

00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,079
believe me i'd

00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,559
rather be have been improving apostrophe

00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,559
but i

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,880
i needed the money so i stopped

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,520
contributing to the project

00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,520
all this time

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,319
let me be clear the rest of the

00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,000
presentation i'll be talking on how to

00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,559
apply by capitalist rules

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,240
but we must acknowledge that the

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,960
underlying issue

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,440
society functions around the concept of

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,200
extracting profit from perceived value

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,480
and that clashes frontally with

00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,800
activities such as

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,000
of course development but we are not

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,400
alone in that

00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,599
artists for example have been dealing

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,599
with this for a long time

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,599
i have the moral need to point to the

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,079
root issue and to radical solutions here

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,800
take political actions if you want some

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,680
sensible

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,240
improvements in this problem and source

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,599
benefit

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,800
benefits societies as art or

00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
science but but is almost exclusively

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,160
fundraised by the means of the people

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,440
who can afford it

00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,160
to give it time such as art or science

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,839
in

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,839
another time as a painting portraits

00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,839
how those solve this arts and science

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,319
a basic science in construct in contrast

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,359
with applied

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,800
science applies science a does she can

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,160
return in investment

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,640
usually so private companies fund apply

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,839
applied science but basic science the

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,240
kind of science

00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,520
which doesn't seek an immediate return

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,960
of the investment

00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:38,160
is no other is a heavily public fund

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,880
and a key towards society's well-being

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,880
i mean this is

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:49,200
a

00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,079
has this what set annually it's a lot of

00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,400
money

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,200
it could be better but this is a lot of

00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,599
money

00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,480
and this is a lot of money not direct

00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,599
towards a

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,240
benefit just we know science is

00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,319
important

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,359
we fund it an art

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:11,440
in the same s in the same center

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,880
in the uh there are artistic residencies

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,599
and there are artistic resident public

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,559
fund all around the world

00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,760
every city has at least one museum with

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,559
publicly acquired

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,119
art that's common we are used to fun

00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,359
activities which while not being

00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,559
capitalizable

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:33,280
benefits society as a whole now

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,599
what about us i think it's time we ask

00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,319
society to start sponsoring not only big

00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,720
open source

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,000
projects but also individuals and small

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,680
applications

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,599
or even better we can ask our

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,640
politicians something like universal

00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,520
basic income

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,240
which will solve a lot of these problems

00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,880
and it

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,680
might sound like an utopia but right now

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,160
there are

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,319
proposals you can sign to ask that in

00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,000
the european parliament

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:03,680
especially after the pandemic

00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,559
this is becoming a a common thing to ask

00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,520
for

00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,960
in fact if you want to sign this there

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,000
is the link

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,000
and a cure

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,040
we shall explore as well the not so

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,359
obvious path of

00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,000
universities universities have been the

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,480
way society allocates public resources

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,040
for arts and science for a long time

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,040
there is a lot of money there and it's a

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,920
good opportunity for developing

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,920
a good open source software

00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,680
monetization of open source applications

00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,960
is a

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,040
faceted problem today we'll take all

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,000
three aspects of it

00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,760
the socialists i've been talking a

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,040
little bit about this one

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,839
the cultural issues which are the

00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,880
natural consequences of the first ones

00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,799
and

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,160
the psychological issues which are

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,559
entirety or fault

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,440
and also always better if we want to

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,040
change things

00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,000
for our community

00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,000
the social issue

00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,319
i'm not going to explain down how

00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:19,200
markets and their capital is

00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,920
one easy concept to an unknown grasp is

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,400
that the perceived value

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,520
the actual value of the product is in

00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,520
this difference

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,720
between those two values where profit is

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,880
made in fact

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,640
now a lot of things influence that

00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,799
perceived value

00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:38,319
but one of the most important ones is

00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:38,319
the price tag we put in it

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,480
but good things don't come cheap and

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,040
we've been conditioned

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,280
our whole life with that premise that's

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,119
why raising the price often raises the

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,240
perceived value of the product

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,520
it reference that directly plays in our

00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,599
disadvantage since

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,280
science-free products automatically are

00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:02,240
perceived as worse

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:04,400
than their commercial counterparts

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,559
that is known as the revlon effect and

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,480
is used a lot by companies such as the

00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:12,079
automatic industry

00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,040
a well-known exam audi and volkswagen

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,960
cars

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,119
and now they may not cost much more than

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,480
their control part to manufacture

00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:22,319
it costs a lot more to the customer

00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,400
and just because of that is why more

00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,799
these are desirable by the

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,799
public

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,640
interesting interestingly enough there

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,599
is a situation where the

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,160
world free mobile mobilized hundreds of

00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,920
people

00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,160
and that's when something that was a

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,200
paid product is off for free at some

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,280
point

00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,799
the price tag helps to set the perceived

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,599
value regarded

00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,119
regardlessly of what you buy at the end

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,920
that's how discounts work

00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,920
it's a basic strategy

00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,200
we are not the only ones with this issue

00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,440
see spain

00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,960
known for one of the best public health

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,760
care programs in the world

00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,559
or at least that's what we like to say

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
to anyone

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,520
anyone willing to listen it is

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,960
universal and free health healthcare

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,160
program which covers

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:19,200
almost everything yet places like

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,319
be free people underestimates

00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,559
how much costs the operation they

00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:26,319
just have there are people who think

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,640
that we should include a deal

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,839
even if at the end of it says everything

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,400
is subsidized

00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,000
or so something like that preciously

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,960
because of this

00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,520
and this also provokes another problem

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,319
which is

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,720
entitlement but i'll be talking that

00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,720
later

00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,280
there's yet another things that plays in

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,359
our disadvantage

00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,559
i'm sure a lot of you know this

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,359
situation

00:57:52,559 --> 00:58:01,520
we're very bad at estimating costs

00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:05,440
yesterday we had a talk on gtk 4.

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,880
it doubled the the estimation of time

00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,720
it will take to develop it we all have

00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:15,200
been a faulty at this kind of thing

00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,920
usually implementing that easy function

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,000
costs us

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,079
four times more than what we thought

00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,440
time is deceiving it is for us

00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,440
and it is even more for our users clean

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,200
neat apps that seem to be easy to

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,680
develop usually

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,799
are the ones that take longer to develop

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,359
and in a world where

00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,400
time is money that means that users will

00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,559
consistently

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,559
underestimate how much a project costs

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,000
on cultural issues

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,079
we've been feeding the idea that

00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,200
everything that linux land

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,760
is in and should be free as in money and

00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,920
in fact

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,319
that's usually one of the hooks we use

00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,480
to attract people to this world

00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:02,640
except that nothing is free and the

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,440
costs of free software are assumed by

00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,000
the

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,440
developers as i was telling at the start

00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,160
of the talk

00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,680
promoting a culture of everything not

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,599
only has consequences

00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,000
on the perceived value of what we have

00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,920
to opt to offer

00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,240
see this is a linux app summit a

00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,200
photo from last year it's a beautiful

00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,799
photo

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:30,000
it shows as well something i like a lot

00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:34,240
about this community which is diversity

00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,599
but diversity is severely impact

00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:41,520
when we don't offer a economic crush

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:45,760
especially for groups of people

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:49,680
we are already

00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,680
discriminated by society

00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,920
this is a graph it shows male female and

00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,440
non-binary people

00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,200
but poles usually don't take nominal

00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:06,400
people into account

01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:10,240
22.6 percent of developers are female

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,839
but in open source only three percent

01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,359
are female and only one percent are

01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:19,119
non-binary

01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:22,319
same goes for as many minorities

01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:26,240
if 34 34 of

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:27,680
developers are from an ethnic minority

01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,599
in open source

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,599
only 16 percent are

01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,160
by being free we also there are a lot of

01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,040
issues here

01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,920
i am not going to pretend money money is

01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,960
the only issue

01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,000
but definitely having

01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,920
a system which encourages

01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,839
people who have the means of

01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,960
contributing because they have

01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:56,559
free time or economic question

01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,799
uh contributors though to

01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,799
this

01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:08,720
no on psychological issues

01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:11,920
i'm gonna recapitulate a little bit

01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,520
uh a donation based model lowers the

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,200
fear of loss you might have

01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,640
in a payment based model it ups

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:23,680
their expectations a lot so why is that

01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,319
if we think about a other donation-based

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,400
models

01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,319
they they are usually built around the

01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,319
day of we are doing a public good

01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,680
and we need your trust and money to keep

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,720
doing it

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,720
well trust is a hard thing to give and

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,040
you usually want the money you donate to

01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,839
be

01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,839
well employed

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:50,000
only that this is a a rough on a typical

01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:53,119
european yearly budget

01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,720
you have housing which amounts for

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:59,920
one quarter of the total income a

01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,359
full transport this

01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,839
square that is donations

01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:08,160
the white biggest square are other

01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,160
things

01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:15,200
some things two whatever the red

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,200
square is donations

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,640
we are competing putting ourselves in

01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,160
that

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:27,200
red square with this kind

01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:29,599
of foundations and non-profits

01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,720
we are comparing a text editor with

01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,160
intermonox fan

01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:36,960
for example okay

01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,599
that that is a bad place to be we want

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:42,799
to compete with

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:46,079
other fun things or

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:49,119
tools or whatever the user

01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,319
is spending their money not with

01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:55,440
charities also

01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,799
that leads to a user entitlement as i

01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,000
was saying before

01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:03,520
i think everyone has experienced it

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,799
any developer this was a an issue open

01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,720
in non calendar a common issue we want a

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,520
holidays of our country as calendar

01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:16,640
events but

01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,160
they start to make very very

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,280
enticing claims like even apple

01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:26,559
does what users ask for

01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,200
i mean you are telling tattoo a person

01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,640
which is devoting their free time to

01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,960
give you a product

01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,760
and you are still asking things like you

01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,760
deserve them

01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,359
no free friction is another issue we

01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,559
have

01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:50,480
effects both device models and

01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:54,640
a and pay what you want

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:57,760
models or that but it affects us

01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,599
say someone perceptual value of your app

01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,400
and is willing to donate some money to

01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,039
it

01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,079
or even to comply with the price you set

01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,359
in a pi what

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,160
you want model probably it won't donate

01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,839
at the end

01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,839
and that's because of the friction of

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,839
the process

01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,559
see let's see how the donate

01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:22,000
workflow goes for a regular fragments

01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,599
it's arbitrary

01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,240
app it's very nice i want to donate to

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,480
it

01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:33,039
so i open the menu go to the add

01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,039
fragments

01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,119
item and pop up

01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,319
opens there is a link to the gitlab

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,640
homepage

01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,480
i click it there are a lot of things in

01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:47,200
the gitlab page

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,599
i scroll down there is a button to

01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,160
download on flat hub

01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,280
we will there and there there it is i

01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,480
don't need button

01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,359
which takes the delivery page off

01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,359
of the devil developer and we still have

01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,160
to make an account on liberal pay if we

01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:04,559
don't have one

01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,520
and we still have to enter or payment

01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,280
details

01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:13,200
and go to the phone and enter the pin

01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,280
the event asks us

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,799
it's a process with a lot of friction

01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,520
and as you see us

01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,200
continue using the app with doing

01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,440
anything

01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:26,480
given to pass people will always follow

01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,520
the one of the resistance

01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:32,400
easier to buy pirate than to pay two

01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,720
dollars people will pay out

01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,319
luckily that goes both ways if we make

01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,119
easier to pay

01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,119
people will pay

01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:46,400
i mean those companies are built around

01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,680
that concept steam or netflix

01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,920
made easier to enter the payment data

01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,440
once and then forget about it

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:58,799
uh you have a whole catalog of games or

01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:01,920
movies uh whatever

01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:03,599
and people pay because it's easier to do

01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:08,480
that than to be searching on

01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,480
davies forums amazon and paypal

01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,359
those are companies that profit from you

01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,280
paying through their platform

01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:20,079
so they they make paying super easy

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,200
you only have to click one button to

01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:26,000
make a purchase on

01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,000
amazon or to send money with python

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:34,720
we when if we make the the path smooth

01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:37,920
people will pay it's as easy as that

01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,720
no give me actual solutions

01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,880
i i don't have them really say that in

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,400
my opinion our best bet comes from

01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,319
public money in any case uh let me give

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,359
you a bit of warning before

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:53,680
giving some tips and tricks of things we

01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:53,680
could do

01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:01,039
beware of success

01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:05,280
krita those are great apps everybody

01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:07,520
knows them they are a sustainable

01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,000
but the amount of apps which are

01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,119
sustainable is very very small this

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,119
is like a football

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,440
music groups or football uh

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,839
i mean even regular business the

01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,359
percentage of people

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:26,160
who succeed is by no means

01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:29,839
representative of the authority of the

01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:32,240
of the businesses or programs or music

01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,240
groups

01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,640
beware of growth funding for the

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,359
majority of people

01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,559
it doesn't work for some does i'm not

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,720
saying don't try it

01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,920
i'm just saying be careful with your

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,280
expectations

01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,280
as they can deceive you

01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,520
a lot of people even very good

01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,240
developers

01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,960
which contribute a lot don't make it

01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,280
through

01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,359
a liberal pie or through patreon

01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,920
you were this is a little bit more

01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:07,119
serious serious

01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,400
i don't know if you know dante's source

01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,559
it changed hands it happens a lot of

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,839
things with it

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:18,000
it's a platform where you uh where

01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,040
there are the issues of projects and you

01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,359
pay a

01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,759
for an issue to be solved and the

01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:28,000
developer developer who

01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:31,759
solves that addition is the one who

01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,120
can claim that money monthly source

01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:37,520
have some problems some public

01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,799
backslash but i want to talk

01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,719
specifically

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:45,440
about the effect the turn cobra effect

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,319
originated in an alert anecdote that

01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,799
describes an

01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,759
occurrence during india under british

01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,759
rule

01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,920
the british government was concerned

01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,880
about a number of animals cobras in

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,719
delhi

01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,040
the government therefore offered a

01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,600
bounty for every dead cobra

01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,480
initially this was a successful strategy

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,040
as large

01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,799
numbers of snakes were killed for their

01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,040
for their reward

01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,920
really however enterprising people began

01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,400
to read

01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,440
cobras for the income when the

01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,679
government

01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,560
became aware of this their reward

01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,520
program was

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,400
shut down causing the cobra breeders to

01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,120
see the worthless

01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:25,040
snakes free and the wild cover a

01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,080
population further increase

01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,359
i similarly copy paste that text from

01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:31,920
wikipedia but

01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,880
this story is what it is and it's our

01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,040
story and it's

01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,000
true the thing is if you put a price tag

01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,960
on

01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,319
a problem you are encouraging that

01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,080
problem to exist

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:49,199
is a tricky question and i

01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,799
advise i can exit

01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:56,880
so what we need to do what we do

01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:59,360
we solve put prices into things even if

01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,920
they usually the user ends not paying

01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,800
anything

01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,560
or paying what they want and we should

01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,760
showcase the effort we put

01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,880
into apps i don't know maybe a

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,640
time spent in this app in

01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,440
soft and software stores could do it

01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,840
and i want to shout out to one company

01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,960
who

01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:23,360
has been doing this successfully which

01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,960
is elementary

01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,320
elementary uh has this greeting page

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,760
when you want to download

01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:34,480
their system it says pay what you want

01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,040
you have three options and then a custom

01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,840
option

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,880
where you can put even zero dollars if

01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,280
you want

01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,640
but this already makes a difference is

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,000
what i was saying

01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,040
this is not a free uh operating system

01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,600
you can

01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,560
donate to this is a pedophile operating

01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,600
system

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,600
you can buy for zero zero dollars if you

01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,679
want

01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,120
this already makes a difference they

01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,520
told me between

01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,480
one or two percent of people who

01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,760
download it

01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,199
donate which might seem a low number but

01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,239
it's a very high

01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,520
com compared to the amount of which

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:15,120
usually donates

01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,679
in other models and it's interesting as

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,280
well

01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,320
people used to put zero and download it

01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,040
for free

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,120
but then you have people which patch one

01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,760
dollar which is the minimum allow

01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,800
quantity over other than zero to

01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,280
download it

01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,960
and then you have people with space

01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,000
terms

01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,719
by having by making it easy to pay ten

01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,159
dollars by having a direct button

01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:45,920
there people pay ten dollars instead of

01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:48,719
i don't know we make things easy

01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,719
people follow

01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:58,400
they know their target it's not the user

01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:02,560
usual linux user is a user

01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:05,760
they know bubbles they break them

01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:09,199
and those are regular business practices

01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:12,640
which is another point if you want to

01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:15,360
be like definitely you have to

01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,080
do business things like marketing or

01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,280
like

01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,040
reaching and doing investigations about

01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,800
your target and the market

01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:28,800
which is up developers usually don't do

01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,800
in the open source area

01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,840
everything okay

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:42,800
now a platform a point of view proposal

01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:52,400
this is what i want this is a markup

01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,360
it's not anything planned but this is

01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,280
you want

01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:58,640
a gnome to have in settings a payments

01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,960
option

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,800
where you can put your bank data your

01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,159
card that

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:10,080
and then you have a simple

01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:12,880
a simple api to donate

01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,000
so apps don't have to to do anything

01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:18,080
just implement

01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,880
the api you click the donate button you

01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,800
click donate

01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,440
and money goes from the user to the

01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,440
developer

01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:30,640
it needs to be something trustable this

01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,360
is why it needs to be an api and not

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,719
some

01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,120
apps implement them themselves we needed

01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,640
to be a centralized

01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:44,400
the desktop or the platform is a big

01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,440
role and it needs it needs to be

01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,840
frictionless

01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,239
you click one button you don't need to

01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,440
do anything more

01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:58,159
you put your data your bank data once

01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,159
you don't need to put it anymore

01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,280
regarding the trustable thing uh it

01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,000
needs to be an api

01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,960
we already do something like that for

01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,159
other things

01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,640
thanks to flat pack and portals apps

01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:14,000
don't know everything about the system

01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,520
they can't access

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,440
access the camera or the file system

01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,600
we delegate on the system for that

01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:25,080
through portals so we already lay

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,800
the wrong for having this kind of

01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:33,600
interoperability between apps and system

01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,600
and it's a secure interpret operativity

01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,320
for users to put their bank data we also

01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,360
need to offer

01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,239
incentives and this is something

01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,120
interesting as well uh two platforms to

01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,199
have

01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,080
for funding platforms though this is not

01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:53,120
a talk on how to fund platforms

01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,760
but there are lots of things platforms

01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,040
could

01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,880
offer like configuration backups or

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,239
sync between devices or passion

01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,440
notifications

01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:07,760
things uh service based on

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:10,400
uh on the cloud might not be

01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,360
backups but things that make the

01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,239
applications

01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,239
a little bit better

01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,520
and this needs to be paid of course

01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,719
everything a

01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,920
clown needs to be paid

01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,199
and that also is an incentive for users

01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,080
to

01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:30,560
join the paid ecosystem within the

01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,560
platform

01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,400
so that will be all thank you for your

01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:39,840
attention

01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,840
attention and if you have any questions

01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,000
hey they say do you think that the fact

01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,400
that the

01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,400
serial tag is not actively displayed

01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:17,360
do you think the fact that the zero

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,159
dollar is not actively displayed on

01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,719
element

01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:21,360
element serious website prevents them to

01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,000
reach

01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,080
a wealthier audience i don't think so in

01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,120
fact they share some data with me

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:33,520
they have that at the beginning they

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:36,719
don't have any more and their

01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:40,320
and now they receive 10 times more money

01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,320
thanks to not having that time

01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,040
what is your opinion on the addition of

01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,199
sponsorship donation buttons on

01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,080
github do you think this will help the

01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:51,440
development

01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,800
of open source of course this is similar

01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,840
to what i propose

01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,719
in the platform level but on github

01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,600
the thing is that by having it on the

01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,400
repository

01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,000
it does not reach a wider audience

01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,360
usually people

01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,360
don't reach to their repos for

01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,840
downloading software so you are like

01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,880
might

01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:19,040
limiting your audience to developers

01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,040
when you have your sponsorship only on

01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:24,560
then you feel users will be wary of us

01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,520
asking about

01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,320
writer bank data that's what that's why

01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,440
we need

01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:36,159
to trust our regarding that

01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:38,800
i mean we already we are

01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,840
managing their their data and their

01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,280
privacy

01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:46,400
so we want a solid foundation this is

01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:49,520
a foundation's sole manage

01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,840
which is tricky it's tricky to manage a

01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,800
payment data and to set up the

01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,920
infrastructure

01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,640
and the legal infrastructure for the to

01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,280
do that

01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,120
but we that's why we have things like

01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:06,159
that in non-foundation

01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:06,159
and they should care care of that

01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:13,120
what do you think about having some kind

01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,440
of open source app

01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,960
monthly subscription something something

01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,800
like spotify

01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:23,760
for open source apps that is interesting

01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,120
it'd be interesting to have some sort of

01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,320
cooperative or

01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:29,760
umbrella to sponsor apps and app

01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:33,040
developers

01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,280
is something something interesting to

01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,280
have

01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,080
how do you see all the communities in

01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,760
here collaborating to

01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:46,640
things happen it will be wonderful

01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,840
we already have this summit which is a

01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,080
collaboration between

01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:56,320
kda kde enum and other players

01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:58,400
which is a very good first step

01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,760
and we already collaborate in other

01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,199
things

01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:05,760
like the portals i've talked

01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:06,719
before so i could totally see that

01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,840
happen

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,840
and it to be careful

01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:26,159
thank you so much manuel

01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:29,840
i think all the questions in the chat

01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,840
or in the shared notes i'm sorry

01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,679
and if that's all the questions we have

01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,840
i'd like to thank you very much for your

01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,840
time and your wonderful presentation

01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,920
i hope you can enjoy the rest of the day

01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:49,280

thank you my pleasure have a wonderful

01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:55,600
rest of the day

01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:59,040
and for our audience we will be taking a

01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:05,840
short 10-ish minute

01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:05,840
recess and we'll be back soon

01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,560
hello and welcome back everyone we are

01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:54,719
here with

thomas and he is going to give us some

01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:57,920
advice

01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,920
on how to help translators help your

01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:03,679
apps get translated

01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,679
tumas are you here with us

01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:13,679
uh yes can you hear me yes perfect

01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:21,840
good uh let's see i can

01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:21,840
if i can share my yeah camera

01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,320
and

01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:35,840
here we go so hello everyone

01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,840
uh can you see me

01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:46,320
okay now there's a picture well

01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:49,440
perfect okay so

01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,320
hello everyone and welcome to my

01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:53,840
presentation

01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:56,880
how to help translators to help your app

01:37:53,840 --> 01:38:03,840
um my name is thomas

01:37:56,880 --> 01:38:03,840
and uh let's see

01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:12,080
sorry i have trouble changing slides

01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:15,520
okay here it goes so

01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:16,320
a few words about myself i've done

01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,880
translating

01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,239
uh free and open source software for a

01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:24,239
few years now

01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:25,360
maybe i don't know since 2017 or

01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:28,560
something

01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,040
so not that long but uh i've done quite

01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,080
a lot

01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:35,040
a lot of translations

01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,040
for various apps

01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:39,280
mostly in libreoffice but also many

01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:43,119
others

01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:45,760
and i recently became a member of the

01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:47,360
document foundation which are the makers

01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,560
of libreoffice

01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:53,119
but for

01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:56,080
clarity i should say that i'm speaking

01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:58,239
only for myself here and

01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,440
not on behalf of any organizations so

01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:01,440
these are my personal views

01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:08,000
and some motivation

01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,639
why is it important to have good

01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,560
translations

01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,239
well if you have if you're creating

01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:15,199
software for end users you probably

01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:19,280
would want to have it

01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:22,159
translated and

01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,920
a well translated app is understandable

01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:27,280
of course

01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:30,080
but it also makes a good impression

01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,119
and conversely a poorly translated app

01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,679
will make a

01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:35,679
bad impression usually

01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:41,119
if you have your trap app translated to

01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:43,840
local language

01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:45,280
it may be deployed in the public sector

01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:49,520
or other

01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,520
large deployments large corporations

01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,800
if your app is not translated it

01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:56,800
may not be eligible for that kind of

01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:00,800
deployments

01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:04,880
and of course when you

01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:07,520
if the if your app is well translated

01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,080
people can recommend it to their friends

01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,119
and family

01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,119
without reservations

01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:19,360
so what can you do to make this happen

01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,360
if you're a developer or a community

01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,840
coordinator

01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:31,920
so first thing is to give credit to

01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:32,719
translators you would think this is kind

01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,840
of obvious

01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:39,280
but in many cases it's really not

01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:41,280
unfortunately or in uh

01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,639
it's better to say in some cases most of

01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,119
these

01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:48,400
projects get this right but

01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,400
unfortunately not always

01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:55,280
um attribution is

01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:57,119
um kind of a cornerstone for free and

01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:58,800
opens up software

01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,400
if you're donating your time to some

01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,199
project at least you get credit if you

01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,199
don't get money

01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,440
and with code it's

01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:10,960
almost universal it works like this but

01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:13,840
with translations

01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,840
not always

01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:23,280
so what is good attribution

01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:26,400
well i named the credits it's fine

01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,880
it's good but

01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,000
it's better if i have some something

01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:34,400
more specific

01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:38,000
which i can point to um

01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:40,960
for example in in if you're a programmer

01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,560
you have a github or gitlab profile

01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,560
probably

01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:47,840
which you can point to you can put a

01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,840
link in your cv or something

01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:55,440
so this is good also for translators

01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,560
let's say if i want to apply for grants

01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,880
or jobs

01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,000
it's good to have something which i can

01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,960
point to that i made

01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,639
this these are my translations you can

01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:09,199
have a look at

01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:09,199
how good i am at translating

01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,880
there's also legal angle although

01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,800
i must make a disclaimer here that i'm

01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:21,119
not a lawyer

01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:24,400
but um if you don't know who

01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:29,040
uh who made the translations to your app

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:31,440
you don't know who holds the copyrights

01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,320
so i think it's also legally important

01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:36,320
or

01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:38,960
or from a licensing perspective that

01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,679
you know who your translators are and

01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:43,840
and can

01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,840
attribute them properly

01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,199
so next one

01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,719
offer modern infrastructure

01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:59,760
so there's um when it comes to code

01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,760
there's a kind of um

01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,320
general trend in and free and open

01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:07,360
source developments

01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,400
uh the trend is moving from patches and

01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,080
mailing lists and

01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:16,239
bugzillas and so on to integrated

01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:19,760
platforms like github and gitlab

01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:21,280
so the question is why shouldn't

01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,840
translators also have

01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,840
this kind of integrated platforms

01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:35,360
and luckily there are options

01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:35,360
for that i think the current

01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:42,080
contenders are webblades

01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:42,080
which is used by

01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,040
fedora libreoffice or pesos meiatus

01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:51,199
another actively developed

01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,280
platform is pontoon which is used and

01:43:54,239 --> 01:44:00,320
developed

01:43:55,280 --> 01:44:03,280
by mozilla and

01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:05,280
there used to be a couple of more open

01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:07,520
source solutions pootle and zanata but

01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,000
they are not being actively developed

01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,000
right now

01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:14,000
and then there are a couple of

01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,280
proprietary alternatives also

01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:21,840
current and transfx which many

01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,840
free and open source projects also use

01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:26,560
the benefits of this kind of integrated

01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:31,440
platform are

01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:33,520
easy user interface sso support

01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,600
integrated glossaries comments user

01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,600
profiles

01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,199
although here i must say that transfix

01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:43,440
doesn't have a very useful

01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:46,400
user profiles which is a kind of a

01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,400
negative if you

01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:51,600
would like to apply for grants or jobs

01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:56,159
or something you can't

01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:59,600
um really prove what you did

01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:01,840
with the transfix user profile

01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,159
so i wouldn't recommend that for that

01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,159
reason

01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,440
there are some objections which i've

01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:12,960
heard in in some discussions

01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:15,040
around these kind of platforms

01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,239
the first one is it's it's too easy

01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,639
anyone can do anything

01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:19,440
and and the quality will suffer and

01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,719
there's some too

01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:24,960
to this uh objection i think

01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:26,800
it can be a problem that uh some people

01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:31,679
do very low efforts

01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:36,239
kind of drive by translations

01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,239
but i think

01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:41,199
kind of software development skills kind

01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,600
of command line wizardry

01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:46,080
is not necessarily a good proxy for

01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,440
translation skills

01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,920
so you want to set some kind of a

01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:53,440
quality bar but

01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,440
setting it by requiring

01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:57,760
software dev development knowledge is

01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:01,199
not necessarily a

01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:05,119
good solutions you can put some

01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:05,119
some access control there of course and

01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:09,679
try to get the quality quality control

01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:13,280
in other ways

01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:15,760
and i'll return to this point later

01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:19,040
the second objection is that these are

01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,040
slower than native code

01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:26,239
yes can be but at least weblade

01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,280
gives the option to use offline tools

01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:29,199
also so you can

01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,119
download the translations from webplate

01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:33,600
and then

01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:34,320
use any tool what you like and then

01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:40,000
upload

01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:43,600
it back again

01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,600
number three be responsive

01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:52,480
sometimes translators can have questions

01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,679
which the developers can answer better

01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:56,159
because they know the code they have

01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,159
written it

01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,560
so if the translators have questions

01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:03,199
please try to answer them

01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:05,679
as a developer because it can save a lot

01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:07,040
of time

01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:10,239
it's good to have some kind of mailing

01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,600
list of forum for general discussion

01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,920
and if you're using webplate or

01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,320
something the comments there are good

01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,600
for discussing specific

01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:23,840
translations or strings

01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:23,840
if of course the developers will respond

01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,880
and i think it's better to take the

01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:30,080
attitude that you don't outsource the

01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:33,840
translations to

01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:37,840
some nebulous community you invite

01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,840
translators to your project

01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,600
and i think sometimes the community can

01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,239
be kind of

01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,520
nebulous because it doesn't really exist

01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:53,600
as a community

01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:57,199
properly uh sometimes it can be that

01:47:53,600 --> 01:48:00,800
there are just random people who

01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:04,719
never really communicate with each other

01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:06,800
um so if you want to know what

01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:08,080
it's like you can imagine wikipedia

01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,840
without the talk page

01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:13,600
so if there are some

01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,880
differences between the editors the only

01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,440
way to settle it is the

01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,239
kind of edit war and this is not really

01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:22,800
what you want

01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:22,800
you want people to communicate

01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,520
so please encourage the formation of

01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:31,440
language communities and give them the

01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:35,199
effort infrastructure that they need

01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:37,119
and uh you have to

01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:39,360
be aware that if you have a very small

01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,960
project it's

01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,679
it might be better to cooperate with

01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:45,920
some other projects

01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:46,800
because a very small project may not be

01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,600
able to

01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,600
attract a very

01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:56,560
large language community

01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,560
if at all

01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:05,280
even bigger porsches can have problems

01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,280
with small languages at least with this

01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:17,440
there is a question of trust

01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:19,760
and in general i think use it verify but

01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,760
trust

01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,040
so how can you trust that random people

01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:25,920
on the internet

01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,440
will translate your app correctly to

01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,840
language you don't necessarily speak

01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,840
yourself

01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:35,280
yes maybe you shouldn't always trust

01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,280
them too

01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,119
if you're running a business and your

01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:44,400
business depends on people having a good

01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:47,040
first impression on your app or website

01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,080
then maybe just hire a professional

01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,679
translator and not

01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,840
trust that random people on the internet

01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,840
will

01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:58,480
make such a good translation that it

01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,480
will make a good impression on people

01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:03,360
or maybe i don't know if you have some

01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,760
security related app which is supposed

01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,520
to

01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:15,040
protect uh journalists or something or

01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,719
then it could be a problem if no one

01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:20,400
reviews the translation

01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:22,840
it's just random people

01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:25,280
translating the stuff with very

01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:29,199
inequality

01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:32,159
um but

01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:34,800
still if you want to uh kind of open it

01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:36,800
for everyone then

01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,400
at least if you credit your translations

01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,599
pro translators

01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:43,599
properly they have kind of a skin in the

01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:47,679
game

01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:53,040
their reputation depends on its

01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:55,760
if they care about that and

01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:57,760
if you have a proper community then

01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:00,159
that's probably more trustworthy than

01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:02,400
than just random people doing random

01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,400
things

01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,520
there's something you can verify sort of

01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,520
too

01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,599
tools like web lates have automated

01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,400
checks

01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:18,800
which are useful to catch some mistakes

01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,800
at least

01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:25,440
but i think uh i must emphasize that

01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,840
someone someone who actually understands

01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:30,880
language must have the final word

01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:34,480
uh you shouldn't let

01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:38,560
automatic checks to override people

01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:38,560
but use them to help people

01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:53,599
next is provide context

01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:56,159
so the problem for

01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:57,040
translating ui strings in most software

01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:59,280
is that

01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:01,760
the strings are often really short and

01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:04,000
ambiguous

01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,760
there are words like link group and

01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,560
lists

01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:11,760
uh they can be their words so now uh

01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,760
these are nouns words

01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,480
so unless you have some kind of context

01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:20,000
you don't know how to translate them

01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:22,000
correctly also words like

01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,159
advanced or connected can refer to one

01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,400
or many things or

01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:27,760
even something like page style then can

01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:31,040
that can

01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:33,679
refer to one page or all pages

01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,400
again you have to know the context what

01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:37,040
it really

01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,040
refers to

01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,480
so tracking down the right context can

01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:45,599
be

01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:47,280
quite difficult and time consuming so

01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:51,840
it's really good if

01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:55,920
developers can help translators by

01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,920
providing some kind of context strings

01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:03,040
so if there's some tag like tooltip or

01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,800
menu item that's good

01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:06,320
and it's even better if you have longer

01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,599
explanations for more

01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,599
difficult strings

01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,880
even a little bit help swap

01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:28,239
next one you should avoid uh

01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,119
hard coding your assumptions in the into

01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:33,440
the

01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:36,880
strings so um

01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:36,880
for example english grammar

01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:45,199
if you rely on the english

01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:49,199
sentence structure that may not be

01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:49,199
applicable to every language

01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:58,159
so instead of

01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,960
using very inflexible structure where

01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:01,840
you have to put

01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,880
a certain word in certain place you

01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,760
should rather

01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,040
try to use variables which the

01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:10,560
translator can then

01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,560
rearrange as they see fit

01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:20,880
but even with variables you might

01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:23,440
or translators of summer languages might

01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:26,639
still encounter problems or kind of

01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:28,560
have to work around a bit because for

01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:32,880
example finnish uses lots of

01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:32,880
inflections so

01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:36,800
even the variables are not really ideal

01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,599
and you kind of have to

01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,639
work around them a bit sometimes but

01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:43,920
then there's

01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:47,040
not really an easy solutions here

01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:47,040
for that kind of languages

01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,880
although there's a project fluent by

01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,520
mozilla which seems quite promising

01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,840
which

01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:57,760
allows more effective flexibility for

01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:00,239
translators

01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:03,280
i haven't tried it myself but it could

01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,280
be a solution here

01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:11,920
um with regard to plural forms

01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:12,719
you can use get text to get the right

01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,520
amount of

01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,520
plural forms

01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:23,040
because they are not always like one or

01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:26,400
many as they are in english they can be

01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:28,719
uh more more of them in in various

01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,800
languages

01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:32,000
and of course date and time formats very

01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,320
calendars vary

01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:39,840
collision rooms very writing direction

01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,840
average length of words

01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:43,440
sometimes there's a problem with

01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:48,000
strings where the developers who speak

01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:50,800
english have

01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
it only left only very little space for

01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,840
the strings

01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,199
but in some languages the words might be

01:55:53,840 --> 01:56:01,840
longer and needs more

01:55:55,199 --> 01:56:01,840
need more space

01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:07,040
okay here's some good news for chance uh

01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:11,840
you don't have to reinvent the wheel or

01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,639
should not

01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:18,000
because a lot of hard localization work

01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,000
has been done for you already

01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:23,920
you should make use of these tools that

01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:28,159
someone has already made for you

01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:30,880
like cldr the common local data

01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:33,360
repository

01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,239
for for example dates times names of

01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:37,199
languages

01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:37,199
names of countries

01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:43,599
you use you should use get text or

01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:45,199
something like that

01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,119
if you need some kind of localized

01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:50,239
citations you could use the

01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:53,199
citation style language

01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:57,520
this is the leap number text for numbers

01:56:53,199 --> 01:57:00,800
and currencies

01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,800
yes use them please

01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:12,239
something you also should consider doing

01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,239
is

01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,719
encouraging fixing issues at the source

01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,119
because your ui strings and

01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:23,440
documentation

01:57:21,119 --> 01:57:25,040
might not be written by technical

01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:27,920
writers who are very

01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:29,199
fluent in english or ux experts they

01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:32,320
might be just written by

01:57:29,199 --> 01:57:33,040
programmers who may not speak english as

01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,679
their first

01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,679
first language

01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:42,800
or fluently at all and and it's

01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:42,800
certainly not their fault

01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,239
they should be doing what they're good

01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:48,239
at which is programming

01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:56,560
but as translators we can help

01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:58,080
because translators are people who read

01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:03,360
through the

01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:07,040
strings a lot and try to understand them

01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:11,760
so if there are some

01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:14,880
strangeness in the strings then um

01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:18,560
trash ladies can can

01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:22,159
notice that and report the issues

01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:23,599
often at least so

01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:25,280
please try to make it easy for the

01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:30,400
translators to report

01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:30,400
or fix the issues in the source strings

01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:36,239
this way you could save work for

01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:40,880
everyone

01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:44,159
and and help fix the issues

01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:49,840
once and for all instead of having every

01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:49,840
translated work around them

01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:59,840
and finally consider sustainability

01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:04,639
well as some of you might remember

01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:07,920
around the

01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:10,239
10 of the millennium there was a

01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:11,840
kind of hype around free and open source

01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:13,440
software that

01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,119
if you just throw your code on the

01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:17,840
internet then

01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:18,159
thousands of volunteers with springford

01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,080
and

01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:25,440
and tirelessly improve it for you

01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,639
well i in around 20 years later we have

01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:29,040
found out that

01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:31,599
no maybe that's not always what's going

01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:33,760
to happen

01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:34,719
and that's not always going to happen

01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:39,840
with

01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,840
translations either so

01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:45,440
i think translators can be

01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:47,920
a lot like maintenance for code in many

01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,920
respects

01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,800
for example uh applications like

01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:56,960
libreoffice are really huge

01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:59,360
in terms of of the ui strings

01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:00,719
and documentation everything there's

01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:03,920
around

02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:04,639
100 000 words in the ui of libreoffice

02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,760
and

02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:09,440
half a million words in the in the help

02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:11,119
and i don't know how many words in the

02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:14,400
in the user guides

02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:15,440
so uh really that's uh if you're trying

02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,360
to

02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:20,159
improve the translation uh

02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:24,639
systematically then

02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:24,639
that's a lot like maintaining software

02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:30,880
so there are some kind of challenges

02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,880
and um

02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:38,080
something uh we as as the

02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:38,639
free and open source software community

02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:41,679
should do

02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:44,719
is try to think of ways how could we

02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:47,760
improve sustainability for

02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,760
translators also

02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:52,320
so um what can you do well at least give

02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:55,599
credits

02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:57,360
give recognition that

02:00:55,599 --> 02:01:00,880
these people are important part of the

02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:03,199
community your project

02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,199
and

02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:09,119
also something we should try to explore

02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:12,000
is to try to open up new

02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:12,000
sources of funding

02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:18,639
i think typically

02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,760
the idea that people could translate

02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:22,560
software for

02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:24,000
public benefits is not really on the

02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:27,199
radar of most

02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:31,520
grant makers like foundations

02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:35,599
or or governments

02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:39,199
but maybe we should try to put it there

02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:41,520
and i don't know maybe

02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:42,800
we could ask also our friendly

02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:47,599
multi-billion

02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:51,199
dollar software companies but

02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:54,960
i don't know what would come out of that

02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:56,800
but if someone someone has

02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,480
really good ideas on how we could do

02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,840
this then

02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:01,840
i'm interested in hearing that

02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:06,880
and i think

02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:16,560
that was all so

02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:19,599
thank you do you have any questions

02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,119
thank you thomas um yes there does seem

02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:22,159
to be a couple of questions in the

02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:26,000
shared notes

02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:29,280
the first one is does weblake.org

02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:33,599
integrate with gitlab

02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:37,119
uh yes i think it does

02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:40,639
yes it uh integrates with github and

02:02:37,119 --> 02:02:43,679
gitlab and actually there's a

02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:44,560
there's even sorry the kind of

02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,760
integration that

02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:51,199
uh these

02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:55,040
it can come it's the if you make

02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:59,040
changes to translations in in web late

02:02:55,040 --> 02:03:01,199
it can commit them automatically to

02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:02,880
to get and and credit you as the

02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:06,000
translator

02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:09,599
so this is a kind of very uh

02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:13,119
specific form of attribution down to

02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:17,599
that do i like a single string

02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:21,280
so i like that okay the next question

02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:24,000
um is a bit of a long one here we go

02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:26,080
i started in boss contributors doing

02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
translations around 2000

02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:29,119
but i think the barrier to start was

02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,440
very high

02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:33,280
basically only someone with a computer

02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:35,199
science background could do it

02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,800
do you think the barrier of entry is

02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:39,840
still high or

02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,840
better nowadays

02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:44,400
i think it depends on the project

02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,040
if the project is

02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:52,960
if it requires you to

02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:57,840
send patches to mailing lists or or

02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,840
something then

02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,960
yeah it could be kind of difficult if

02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:03,199
you don't know anything

02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,440
anything about version control or

02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:08,400
software development

02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:09,040
but if the project uses something like

02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:13,679
webplate

02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:16,480
then it's quite a bit easier

02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:17,280
you need to make an account or maybe you

02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:20,239
can use your

02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:21,360
github or google or something some

02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:26,960
account like that

02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:29,760
and log on to webblades and

02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:31,679
it's relatively easy to start

02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:34,320
translating

02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:36,159
of course it depends on the size of the

02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:38,239
project also

02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:39,599
so something small is easier to get

02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:42,800
started with than something

02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:42,800
huge like libreoffice

02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:53,040
thank you it looks like that's all the

02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:54,639
questions we have

02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:56,719
i'd like to thank you for your wonderful

02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:59,040
presentation and i hope everyone enjoyed

02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:02,000
it as much as i have

02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:03,920
i hope you can also stay and hang around

02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,840
with us for the rest of the day

02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,840
tonight there will be a pub quiz

02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:13,599
if you'd like to join

02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,960
uh yes seems nice yeah thanks for having

02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:18,159
me

02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:21,119
great well

02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:22,800
for our wonderful audience i would like

02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:26,880
to give a big round of applause

02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,360
to tomas and we will be taking a short

02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:35,840
break

02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:35,840
and come back at 20 past

02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:26,880
hello and welcome back everyone we hope

02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:30,000
you are ready for our next talk

02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:32,160
which is given to us by collabora

02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,439
the talk is about collaborating valve

02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:36,000
and um

02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:37,359
in just a moment you'll be seeing it pop

02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:39,600
up in video

02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:40,640
please put all of your questions in the

02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,880
shared notes

02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:44,080
and we will have a live q a session at

02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:51,840
the end of

02:22:44,080 --> 02:22:51,840
this presentation

02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:06,240
[Music]

02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:09,840
welcome to this talk collaborating valve

02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:13,280
what we're doing

02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,800
and why we're doing it first

02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,800
a little bit about the companies

02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:18,479
involved you obviously

02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:20,160
don't need to be told through valvar

02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:23,280
they're kind of a big deal in

02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:24,960
a pretty major company but who are we

02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,560
well collaborate are an open source

02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:28,560
software consultancy

02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:30,240
um you know that may or may not tell you

02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:32,080
what sort of things we do depending on

02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:35,120
how much you know about the fields so

02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:37,760
what sort of things do we do well

02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:39,439
that depends on who's asking seriously

02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:41,840
actually does depend on who's asking

02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:44,000
because we cover a wide range of areas

02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:45,359
we've done work in graphics graphics

02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,880
drivers

02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:51,920
putting stuff on screen western

02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:53,680
multimedia web engines we do

02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:55,040
customization work for people if they

02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:57,200
need something

02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:59,280
fixed up to work just right for them and

02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:01,520
ideally upstream changes as well if the

02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,600
upstream project is interested

02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:04,960
similarly bug fixes in a project that

02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,840
they might be using

02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:09,439
we work on that and upstream the fixes

02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:11,840
later

02:24:09,439 --> 02:24:13,200
we've done integrated platforms with

02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:14,319
people so basically if someone needs a

02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:17,120
custom platform

02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:18,160
for all their products that that is

02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,080
going to be used

02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:21,600
by them and then we do that and they're

02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:23,120
building integration systems and

02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:26,000
reproducing those bills

02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:26,399
so a wide range of areas come by what we

02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,760
do

02:24:26,399 --> 02:24:30,800
so um and hopefully you'll see that in

02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,600
the list of work

02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:35,120
that we do for valve which we will go to

02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:36,880
next since that's what you're really

02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:40,080
here for

02:24:36,880 --> 02:24:42,880
so what's first on our list let's

02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:43,520
start with this intercepting syscalls um

02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:45,600
so

02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:47,439
what's this all about so um if you know

02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:50,000
what a syscall is it's when

02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:51,359
the user space makes a call into the

02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,399
kernel for a specific piece of

02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:55,600
functionality

02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:56,800
a system call now normally this sort of

02:24:55,600 --> 02:25:00,319
thing is mediated

02:24:56,800 --> 02:25:03,760
via the library or a runtime such as

02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:06,319
your c library um but you can make

02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:08,080
direct set calls um if you know the

02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:10,880
number of the syscall you want to make

02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:12,160
and what kind of parameters it needs so

02:25:10,880 --> 02:25:14,560
why is this important

02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:15,680
well uh when you've got something like a

02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:17,200
game

02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:18,880
for example it's obviously going to be

02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:21,680
important to someone like valve

02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:22,800
or an application which makes this call

02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:26,399
if it goes via

02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:28,479
a library it can be intercepted

02:25:26,399 --> 02:25:30,160
by an emulator or a non-emulator

02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:34,319
depending on your point of view

02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:37,520
such as wine or proton and so we can run

02:25:34,319 --> 02:25:38,479
these things on a non-native system such

02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:41,760
as

02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:44,240
linux through an emulator if we

02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:45,680
can intercept this calls to do with that

02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:49,439
part of the emulation

02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:50,319
now lately more and more applications

02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:53,439
have been

02:25:50,319 --> 02:25:54,479
bypassing the libraries the dlls in the

02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:56,080
windows world

02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:57,520
which are used which provide the

02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,280
wrappers for these syscalls

02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:01,760
sometimes the cisco might not even have

02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,720
a wrapper this is problematic because of

02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,520
course if we don't

02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,240
intercept cisco then we've just made an

02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:09,280
unknown

02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:11,120
strange almost certainly bad request to

02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:13,920
the linux kernel

02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:15,439
and frankly it's going to be chaos cats

02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:17,359
and dogs living together

02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:19,120
the end of the world and more

02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:20,160
importantly your game's not going to

02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,319
work so

02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:24,080
we need to do something about that and

02:26:22,319 --> 02:26:26,880
because it's a game

02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:27,680
where this matters more than usual we

02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,520
need to do it

02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,760
efficiently and quickly there needs to

02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:35,600
be as little overhead as possible

02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:36,880
so what can you do a few approaches were

02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:38,800
tried

02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:40,479
one of the original approaches was to

02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:42,880
use se linux

02:26:40,479 --> 02:26:44,800
to trap the calls and effectively make

02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:47,600
them forbidden and then react to them

02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,080
to redirect them unfortunately that's a

02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,040
bit

02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:52,160
um there's a bit of a hammer to crack in

02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:55,359
that situation

02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:56,720
um it works but it's not fast there's a

02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:59,920
lot of overhead

02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:02,319
um and it's really far from ideal

02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:03,600
another approach was to use setcomp in a

02:27:02,319 --> 02:27:06,720
sort of similar way

02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:07,680
um again a bit of pushback from that

02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:09,760
from the community

02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:11,200
it's not ideal it's not really the right

02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:14,240
shape for tool for the job

02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:15,439
and using something that should be for

02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:17,359
security for

02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:18,800
non-security uses is generally frowned

02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:20,720
upon because you

02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:22,640
increase your attack surface area by

02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:23,920
doing unexpected things

02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:25,600
you might actually introduce the

02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:26,880
vulnerability when the whole purpose of

02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:30,479
it is to

02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:33,840
prevent vulnerabilities or ameliorate so

02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:37,040
um what what did we end up doing

02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:41,359
so the thing that we ended up going with

02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:44,479
was a personality based mechanism which

02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:46,800
by extending a little bit of

02:27:44,479 --> 02:27:47,520
infrastructure in the kernel allows us

02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:50,000
to track

02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:52,479
calls from particular addresses and

02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:56,319
particular parts of an application

02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:59,120
which means that we can very easily

02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:59,920
enable and disable this trapping and we

02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:02,000
can trap

02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:04,479
just the syscalls that we are interested

02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,399
in and let the rest go through which is

02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:08,479
great because that is really what you

02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:11,280
want to do you're only interested

02:28:08,479 --> 02:28:12,000
in trapping a few of the syscalls this

02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:14,160
approach has

02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,680
the additional advantage that we don't

02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:18,720
need to change

02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:20,640
or monkey patch the game binaries or the

02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:23,680
game libraries at all

02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:25,520
because obviously that's tricky because

02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:27,200
that can often fall foul of anti-cheat

02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:30,160
mechanisms who have

02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:31,680
no way of distinguishing between you

02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:33,200
doing something for the purposes of

02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:36,160
emulation and someone

02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:37,359
intercepting syscalls to try and beat an

02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:41,040
anti-cheat

02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:42,640
mechanism so um that's what we ended up

02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,720
going with i think that one's

02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:46,240
wending its way into the kernel i don't

02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:47,680
think it's been accepted yet but the

02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:48,800
patches have been going back and forth

02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,640
from the list

02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:53,120
and hopefully that will land soon to

02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:55,840
bring us a better wine and proton gaming

02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:55,840
experience

02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:00,160
on to the next item case and sensitive

02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:02,880
file systems

02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:03,520
so um you know obviously this is a

02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:06,800
fairly

02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:08,800
easy one to understand on

02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,240
in the windows world where most games

02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:13,439
come from these days

02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:15,359
days uh file systems are case

02:29:13,439 --> 02:29:17,840
insensitive you don't have to care

02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:19,120
what cases uh patterns you use when

02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:22,080
accessing files

02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:23,040
it all works regardless of what you've

02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:25,600
used

02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:27,439
this is very much not the case in the

02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:30,479
unix linux world

02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:32,000
we expect a change in case to mean a

02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:35,120
different file

02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:37,040
now while a lot of the hard work of

02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,000
porting to multiple platforms is taken

02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:41,200
care of by

02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,760
things such as unity you've still got a

02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:46,240
problem in the way that they are used

02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:48,160
so one thing that we tend to see a lot

02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:50,479
is that game developers or application

02:29:48,160 --> 02:29:53,120
developers often have quite a hazard

02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:55,120
approach to the capitalization patterns

02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:56,399
they use they'll request a file with an

02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:58,319
initial capital

02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:59,920
or if a different developer is part of

02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:00,640
doing that part of the code maybe all

02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:03,600
caps

02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:04,000
or possibly they'll be intercapped in a

02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,800
different

02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,680
way because that's not necessarily

02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:09,760
obvious

02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:11,760
and this can cause huge problems because

02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:15,200
random assets in the game can suddenly

02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:18,479
appear to not be there and not be found

02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:19,760
and that makes porting much more painful

02:30:18,479 --> 02:30:22,080
than it needs to be

02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:24,240
and of course it's quite hard to tell

02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:25,040
someone who's used to a case folding

02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:26,800
file system

02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:28,640
no no you actually have to be consistent

02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:30,000
all the time

02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:33,040
from their point of view quite

02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,520
reasonably it's just

02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:37,120
an onerous and unreasonable request that

02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:39,680
they're not going to do anything about

02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,439
so we have to solve the problem if we

02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:44,560
want porting to be easy

02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:45,600
so how do we do this the approach that

02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:49,120
we've gone with

02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:52,800
is to allow case folding support

02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:55,120
in the ext family file systems

02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:57,040
and i believe we're also looking at once

02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:58,880
that work has landed and been accepted

02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,640
to extending that work to other file

02:30:58,880 --> 02:31:03,600
systems

02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:05,120
you might say that that should go in the

02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:08,000
vfs layer and

02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,439
that's a reasonable thing to say and one

02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:12,160
of the things that we will look at

02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:15,200
once we've gotten to the point of the

02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:18,240
mechanisms and the work being accepted

02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,880
is maybe getting that into the vfs layer

02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:21,760
um when i say we i'm not actually doing

02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:25,359
the work

02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:27,840
um it's one of my colleagues um so uh

02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:29,520
we'll see where that goes and hopefully

02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:31,120
we're getting pretty close i think again

02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:32,800
this is something that should

02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:35,120
has either been merged or should be

02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:37,280
merged to colonel soon i hope

02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,800
once everything's accepted one

02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:42,399
particular thing

02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:45,040
that we had to work on quite a lot

02:31:42,399 --> 02:31:45,600
that was added quite a bit of complexity

02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:48,560
to the

02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:49,920
the whole process was local and unicode

02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:51,439
support

02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,960
case folding's a lot easier when you

02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:55,280
just have asking to consider

02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:56,240
but when you consider locales where

02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:58,160
cases

02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:00,160
some characters might not be considered

02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:01,520
characters that have a case in some

02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:03,760
might be considered to have cases in

02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:06,080
others all that good stuff

02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:07,439
has gone into our implementation so uh

02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,800
hopefully it will be coming

02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:13,280
to a ported game near you someday very

02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:13,280
soon now

02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:16,720
next up runtimes and keeping them up to

02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:19,280
date

02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:20,720
so i'm not going to waste too much of

02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,840
your time explaining something that you

02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:24,399
probably know but

02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:24,960
what is the run time probably best to

02:32:24,399 --> 02:32:27,120
think of it

02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:28,960
as a promise that's made to an

02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:31,120
application or game developer

02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:32,479
about everything that's going to be

02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:34,479
available to the game

02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:35,680
when it runs in terms of library

02:32:34,479 --> 02:32:38,240
versions

02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:40,000
software all the little bits of

02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:41,520
infrastructure that go around it that

02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,120
you would normally expect to come from

02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:44,800
your distribution in your operating

02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:47,520
system

02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:48,399
the idea with the runtime is that the

02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,479
application

02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:52,319
or game developer targets a particular

02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:55,280
runtime at a particular version

02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:57,200
and then doesn't worry too much about

02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:59,359
the actual version or distribution

02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:00,960
of the operating system that they'll be

02:32:59,359 --> 02:33:03,280
running on

02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:04,880
this is great from their point of view

02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,560
from maintainer's point of view

02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:10,960
it doesn't actually change problem

02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:12,560
the runtime still needs to be maintained

02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:16,319
what do i mean by maintained

02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:18,960
well security fixes are a thing

02:33:16,319 --> 02:33:21,520
just because you're not fixing libraries

02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:23,280
provided by your distribution

02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:24,880
you still need to fix the ones provided

02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,840
by your runtime you know if there's a

02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:28,160
security breach

02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:29,280
if there's a floor you need to fix it it

02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:32,399
needs to be rolled out

02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:34,720
all of those runtimes need to be updated

02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:36,800
protocol changes you know the outside

02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:39,120
world changes there's the limit how much

02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:39,680
we can isolate a game if it needs to

02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:42,319
talk to

02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:44,000
a server if it needs to talk to external

02:33:42,319 --> 02:33:46,399
services

02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
particularly multiplayer games there

02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:50,160
might be network issues

02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:52,160
um so something needs to be done about

02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:53,920
that the library that it's using

02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:56,000
all that stuff needs to be looked at it

02:33:53,920 --> 02:33:57,040
might not be a security fix but it might

02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,760
still stop working

02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:01,520
um tls certificates roots this might

02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:03,280
would be an example of that

02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:05,280
that stuff needs to be in the run time

02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:08,080
and it needs to be kept up to date

02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:09,760
and of course there is random monkey

02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:10,319
patching at the run time for legacy

02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:12,240
reasons

02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:14,080
something might be broken something

02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:14,640
might have changed in an unpredictable

02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,319
way

02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:18,000
we've had a flag day in the world which

02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:19,600
means that everything needs to

02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,240
fit in its house in order to keep on

02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:24,000
working um that still needs to happen

02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:25,359
and it needs to happen for each runtime

02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,280
that is still supported

02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:28,640
and since the point of a run time is

02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:30,560
that it should stay supported for a

02:34:28,640 --> 02:34:31,280
really long time so that a game that you

02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:34,560
bought

02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,680
five ten years ago still works you still

02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:37,680
need to do that

02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:39,280
so this is one of the another one of the

02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:41,840
things we do

02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:41,840
