00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
uh to i guess further introduce

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,160
ourselves i

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
thought we'd start off with some quick

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,880
intros

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,440
so um i will ask the panelists to each

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,720
quickly tell us your name where you're

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,280
currently based

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,880
what open source projects you belong to

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
or how you're affiliated with open

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
source

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,080
and a highlight from this pandemic

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
sometimes you focus on the bad stuff so

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
let's think about something good that

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,759
came out of it um

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,800
let's see annika can you please go first

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,800
sure hi everyone my name is anika and

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
i'm working for kde right now as a

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
marketing consultant

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,560
and i think this pandemic has helped us

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
a lot right now we are having this

00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
virtual session

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
and i think uh before we would have

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
never thought about it we might have

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,560
traveled

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,199
and i think this has made a little bit

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
of things easier for us

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
awesome thanks i'll just go down the way

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:21,840
that the photos are

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:21,840
organized so cassidy you're up next

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,880
let's see yeah hand waving all right

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,720
perhaps you can test um

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,280
or it's okay don't worry about it

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
as you figure out your audio settings um

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
maybe

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,919
oh there you go perfect okay yeah so

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,639
there's this

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,199
leaf audio button in the middle i that's

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
really

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,160
not smart design anyway

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,280
sorry i'm just and just just

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
yeah it all works for me uh i live in

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,360
berlin

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,639
um i'm well maybe so my all-time

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,319
kd contributor quite a while ago mostly

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
helping in the marketing team and later

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
also contributed to opensuse

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,160
i currently head up marketing at next

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
cloud

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,759
and for us quran has been i guess less

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
disruptive than for most companies so we

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
already worked from home

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
and i think the highlight is a bit that

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,759
we really helped a lot of companies and

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
i'm guessing also a lot of private home

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
users to

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
to work from home to work remotely of

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
course while

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,680
you know protecting their privacy

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,400
security and all that

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,919
so people also care more about it now i

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
guess they're more aware of

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,080
like you know if you suddenly have all

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,080
your stuff or you have to work remote

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
then people care more about

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,440
how safe the data is which i think is a

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
bit of a plus

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,160
given privacy you know being under

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,840
threat so

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,120
yeah great thank you um and i just will

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
introduce myself too

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,599
just so that everybody knows who i am my

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,479
name is noritzi and i'm based in

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,520
california in the san francisco bay area

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160
and i first got introduced to open

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
source

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
really through gnome and my work with

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,280
endless

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,319
um and now i'm working on a lot of um

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,039
more like cross open source

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,720
initiatives um for example the chaos

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,759
project where we're trying to develop

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,879
open source

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,479
metrics um and a highlight from my

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,000
pandemic is also kind of the

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,479
connection my sister who has been based

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,639
in

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,479
los angeles was able to come up and work

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,240
from the bay area and so it was so nice

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,599
to see her for a few months

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,479
and really enjoyed my little sister

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,760
so uh we are going to dive right into

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,600
these questions

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,080
i love that you know you all are from

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,120
organizations

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,600
um you know that that very much

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,440
oftentimes you know people will think of

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,279
open source as being a place for

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,920
developers and i think in recent years

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,399
we've

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,760
started to change that terminology into

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
more contributors

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,440
and i just noticed that you all have

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
great backgrounds or are involved in

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,839
things like marketing design

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
business legal the legal aspect of

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,640
things

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
and so i wanted to hear a little bit

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,279
more from you about

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,200
um how your backgrounds are contributing

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
to the vos projects that you're involved

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
with

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
and how important that is and how it's

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,560
contributing really to the linux

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,440
ecosystems growth

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,480
and then how can we attract more people

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
who identify

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
you know from backgrounds like yours

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
and i'll open it up to panelists anybody

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,839
who wants to

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
start off and if not i'm going to pick

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,160
up you

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,000
so um so i

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,200
uh boy so the problem is there are too

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,399
many lawyers

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760
um so uh we i

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
that's i mean it's a little bit of a

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,279
joke but it's also

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
you know it's interesting i got involved

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,399
in all this um

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,959
so when i very first got involved in

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,480
in well when i first got involved open

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,320
source as a phrase was still a few

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
months away from being coined

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,640
uh so when i got involved it was free

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,079
software and uh

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,399
we really thought the lawyers were

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,040
really important and

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,880
that uh you should that you needed them

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
to help structure how people worked with

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,440
each other right the licenses

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,399
we thought were really central and um

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
you know and and i think uh the good the

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,040
good news for the

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,160
community the bad news for me uh

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,760
though it's it's been great uh is that

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,200
um you know i think we've realized

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,720
that the lawyers are much should play a

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,920
much more background role

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,240
right uh where we

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,240
are there for defense which the gnome

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,360
foundation has needed a couple of times

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,480
uh certainly uh but the by and large

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,680
uh the legal tools are either mostly

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,880
already done

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,120
uh or much less relevant than we thought

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
right that the other community aspects

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
things like marketing

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,680
we did have a marketing team briefly in

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,079
the early 2000s suffice to say

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,480
uh what y'all are doing now is a lot

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,399
more organized a lot more powerful

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,600
um and you know like that's

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,959
i think it's actually really a good

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
thing the lawyers are much less of

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,760
focused than they used to be

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,440
so cool thank you for that insight

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,920
yeah and i completely agree with you i

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
think that um katie and gnome's

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,279
marketing over the last few years

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
especially has been given more of a

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,800
focus i'd say

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
um so we have some people who are

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,160
involved in that do you want to just

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
talk a little bit more about

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,440
some of the challenges that you're

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,440
facing with marketing open source

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,480
or some of the things that you've seen

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
that are really positive and you'd like

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
to see more of

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,880
i i don't want to budge in because i

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,839
know anika does of course marketing in

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
kve

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,639
um but at least from next cloud

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,120
perspective i can

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,279
say a few things i mean in the end

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
when you're um when you're running open

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
source project in the end it's a

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
software project like any other

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,880
and you have a kind of a battle for the

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,800
hearts and minds of users so to say

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,639
right there are multiple solutions and

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,000
and people have to pick

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,880
um and plain and simple

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,560
they have to find what you have and they

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
have to get the idea that it fits what

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,639
they need

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,240
um so the very basics of marketing which

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,720
is just a communicator product is

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,600
something you you obviously need

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,600
and and beyond that of course you have

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,279
huge advantage that

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,959
often you have a big community people

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
who talk about the product who tell

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,240
other people about the product

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
and i think this is how open source or

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
free software in the beginning became

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
really popular and this is still i think

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,000
really core

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,639
to how open source communities spread

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,399
their software i mean it is for us

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:16,240
but you still need to to go beyond that

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,839
um i am a strong believer

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,000
in a need

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,120
a commercial push behind the open source

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,519
project

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
um i think it's very hard to become

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,880
successful without full-time paid people

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,560
and full-time paid people means

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,480
well you got to earn money somewhere you

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,399
can of course rely on donations but that

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,519
only gets you so far

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,079
and that means you need to

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
reach people who can pay now obviously

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,600
private users can pay bid

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:51,600
but companies tend to you know be a much

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,839
more suitable target and

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
yeah i mean how many companies are you

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,480
gonna get by

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,240
you know advocacy of private users

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,560
some absolutely you can't ignore that

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
but in the end when you talk to you know

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
a business person

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,959
um it's going to be very hard to

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,000
convince them

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,440
of an open source solution

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,120
without having some yeah marketing

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,199
both materials and videos

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,800
everything like the whole range this is

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,959
just necessary

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,839
so i think for an open source project to

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,199
go beyond

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
you know one or a few people coding in

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,639
the free time

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
and to become something that really

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
influences the world

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
and i mean i don't speak for everyone

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,000
but for me that's that's motivation

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,480
right i want to make an impact beyond

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
i don't know myself if you want to do

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,760
that you need

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,279
yeah you need marketing and you need

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,839
people who write documentation

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
and you need basically everything beyond

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,160
the codes

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
because this code isn't going to cut it

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
my sense

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,880
definitely okay um and

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,360
i wonder uh i know that um

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,440
anika you know the kde team has

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,120
experienced growth in the marketing team

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
can you tell us a little bit more about

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,519
specifically again

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
um maybe how kde is approaching

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,480
marketing

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,639
and kind of your plan moving forward for

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,639
it

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,959
i think for me i will use myself as an

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,000
example because i am a very newbie for

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,000
open source society and for me it was

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,160
very difficult to understand how

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
things work so i keep myself as an

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
example if you're

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,959
approaching a person who's not a lead

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,519
user how are you going to actually

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,399
ask them to join uh this linux desktop

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,600
environment

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,600
so i think uh now we are as you know i

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,480
got in touch with you also we are trying

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,639
to

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
reach out more of the local communities

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,800
how are they going to help us to reach

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,720
out to more users because you know

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,880
uh for open source society you can't

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,399
just have a simple kind of marketing

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,399
it's not just that you can just

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,839
you know have promotions over the social

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,079
media that will be enough

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,519
that is not because you need a snowball

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,800
technique you know people who can

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,279
actually reference

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
uh one another so the best thing is

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,560
which i think a lot of

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
communities have already done ambassador

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,399
programs and

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,079
reference programs some for some it was

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,680
successful for some it was not

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
and for kde that's why we are starting

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,800
the kde network program hopefully we

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,920
will be able to rule out

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,519
uh in a few months and our pilot study

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,399
will start from india

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
and the whole idea is to start from one

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
user

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
and who can actually bring on more you

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,839
have more users on board

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,839
so that's the whole idea

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
well i completely agree with you i think

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,560
um

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,759
when i first started at gnome i also um

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,160
tried to start a group in san francisco

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
specifically um and and had a lot of

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,079
women interested

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
in joining um from backgrounds actually

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,120
like

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
lawyers who wanted to get out of law and

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,679
um

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
you know people who maybe had taken a

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
break in their career

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,959
and wanted to um start learning how to

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,199
program

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,360
and thought that open source would be a

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,039
great way to do that

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,880
and when i tried to explain what gnome

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,919
was i was you know

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,559
new to the community too i didn't have

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,559
great

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,720
stories and people were kind of like

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,080
okay i don't totally get why this

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,799
matters or like what i'm doing and so i

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
think that we

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,200
you know we have already improved our

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,720
stories but storytelling is so important

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
in this and we have to find

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,360
new ways to reach audiences that are

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
totally new to this space and so may

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,240
need

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
more understanding of why it matters and

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,640
how to do it and rewards um

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
companies do that as well so kind of

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,440
along with that you know thinking about

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,360
um you know linux desktop technology is

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,240
not necessarily the hot new tech that

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,960
everybody

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,760
wants to jump into um and paired with

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,039
like you know

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,160
we have to find innovative ways have you

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,880
engaged in any uh innovative ways to

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
reach

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,400
new users or you know know of others

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
that you think what

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
our communities should try um and i'm

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,240
thinking of you clarissa

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
i know that you mentioned that you're um

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,320
you know starting a program around this

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
uh maybe you can lead off and others can

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,360
join

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
yeah i totally can relate with you about

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,120
um

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,520
trying to explain why why do we

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,160
contribute to open source to people who

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,520
are not

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,520
like uh they don't live that day by day

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,320
so it's very hard to explain that for

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,679
them

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:46,160
um i'm not very good at um i don't know

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:48,640
making sort of a marketing and

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
and spreading the love of open source

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,960
for people so it was

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,440
really hard for me to to explain them

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
that

00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,320
like so yeah

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,600
uh we are running this this initiative

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,760
that we we want people to getting

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,799
engaged in open source especially from

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,520
brazil because

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
um we have lots of people there like the

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,880
population of brazil is

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,280
giants but we don't have uh

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
many people involved with open source so

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
we wanted to reach

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
a brazilian community like we wanted to

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
grow the

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,120
brazilian community in open source and

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,400
give them autonomy to contribute to

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,679
whichever

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,720
open source software they wanted to

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
but first we had to talk to like to to

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,080
tell them what

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,840
open source is and why should they

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,200
contribute to open source

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,400
so it was a very big challenge

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,919
but in the end they they got it and

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,679
most of them are getting engaged and

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:58,559
i think the most important thing that i

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:01,360
we did for them is was to tell them that

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
they are needed you know that their work

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,400
matters

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:09,760
and we need more people to to

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
to take part on that and that every work

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
that

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,520
even though they are beginners uh even

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
though

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,200
they are going to different fields like

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
marketing or

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,080
usability they they they can get

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,200
uh they have something to offer to

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,640
any community because everyone has

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,000
the capability of doing anything that

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,039
they i don't know everyone has skills

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,080
to to offer to the community so

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:44,720
and adding to the other question i think

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,320
uh um especially talking about usability

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,880
i had no background

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,760
on usability i was like the opposite

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
that

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,240
uh we expect i i am a software

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,760
engineering student so i was

00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,240
all like developing stuff and coding

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,520
but i saw an opportunity of learning

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,080
usability by

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,679
doing usability tests for gnome and i

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,039
had no background on

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,960
design or usability or stuff like that

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:16,240
and i was able to just like being

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,039
like i was a user for gnome

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,039
um like i used you know for many years

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,760
before i started contributing

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,000
and just by being an user i was able to

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,360
contribute to usability testing

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,480
like like an user like a beginner

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,480
so yeah i think anyone should

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,120
try to to learn a little bit about

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,559
usability and run usability

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,080
tests so anyone

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:48,799
has the skills to do it you just gotta

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,799
search for your oreo field

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,559
sorry i thought i was unmuting myself

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
and i muted myself um i was just going

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
to say

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,120
yes i i completely agree and i love that

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,440
idea that you know

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,240
you might have skills or superpowers

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,200
that you

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,960
didn't even realize you know and just by

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
being in an open source community or

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,440
being exposed to this you might say

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,880
hey i can contribute in this way that i

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,000
didn't think was possible

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,559
and you can start you know a whole other

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
side that you never knew was possible so

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,919
um

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,880
that's great and cassidy i know that um

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
you know you're

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,159
also involved in um interesting ways to

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
reach new users elementary has had some

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,760
really great success

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
do you have anything to add here and if

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,440
not we'll just kind of

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,400
move on yeah absolutely um

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
really to attract new users especially

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,039
uh

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,320
you really need to focus on the

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,520
experience

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,000
in creating the best product period

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,880
um people don't use software because

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,640
it's open source

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,919
at least the vast majority of people on

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
earth don't use

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,880
software because it's open source um

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,200
you compete with that proprietary

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,280
software by making a better experience

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,159
and by competing in areas in which the

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,960
proprietary software can't compete which

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,520
is

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,120
for example privacy you can never have a

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
truly privacy respecting

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,559
piece of software if it's closed source

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,600
or if it's proprietary

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,880
so we need to lean into that and

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,480
focus on you know creating the best

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,760
experience you can and focus on

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
competing in ways that

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,240
you just you just can't compete with the

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,240
alternatives

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,880
yeah i think people are plus winning you

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,799
totally agree

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,360
um cool so i um

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,400
one of the questions that i have is

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
around

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,720
um collaboration so you know

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,440
we're all doing our best to create you

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
know

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
great experiences i think that there's a

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,360
lot of opportunity for

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,279
again other backgrounds to get involved

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,600
product managers to come on in

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,360
and other and you know ux specialists

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,600
etc

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,880
but you know as we think about

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,799
increasing

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,480
um the the users around the linux app

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
ecosystem

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,559
where do you see opportunities for

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,799
communities to collaborate

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,080
um and then what do you think is

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,720
something that individual

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,420
projects really need to take on them by

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
themselves

00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,159
[Music]

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,480
if i may speak a little bit from a kind

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,520
of outside perspective

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,120
because we as next cloud i mean we are

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,559
all people from the kde and gnome

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,200
community in the company or at least a

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
lot of us

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,640
are as well from other open source

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,760
communities

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,159
um but of course now we're well

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,400
a third-party project and and one of the

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,679
things we do is we build an app

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:54,159
the desktop client also mobile clients

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,720
and um you know

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,679
if you want to grow an app ecosystem i

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,320
mean there's

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,159
there's a pool and a push you know like

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,480
there's there's a benefit of building an

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,279
app for an app developer which is

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,279
in simple terms reaching people and

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,720
there's a cost which is how hard it is

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,360
to make an app available for the

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,240
platform and make it work everywhere

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,880
and if i get to complain a tiny little

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
bit

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,720
um you know there is of course still

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,080
issues with standards and like in our

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,039
case notifications

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,039
and system tray like gnomon kd developed

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,919
the standard for system tray but it's

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,440
not supported by gnome as far as i know

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,440
so our app which uses a system tray

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
doesn't really work in a logical way for

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,279
a lot of gnome users

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,480
and that kind of issues i mean i get

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,720
uh that the desktops and and uh

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,720
well those who built the echoes the

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,640
platform so to say they want to innovate

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,760
you want to move forward

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,760
um you don't want to be held back but

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,440
perhaps with legacy things

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,960
but that does mean you lose independent

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
app developers

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,120
and you got to really balance that in a

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,440
smarter way um

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,880
and work with others in this regard

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,520
because this

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,400
this increases the costs and you know we

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,600
all know

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
that the user base of linux desktop

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,360
isn't great

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,640
isn't huge uh luckily i think there is

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,720
some exciting moment

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,559
momentum i have a couple of small pc

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,159
vendors that seem to be growing and

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,840
becoming more prominent

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,440
and there are the bigger ones at dell

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,279
and lenovo of course

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,200
i really kudos to the people who made

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,200
that happen i don't know who

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
deserves the credit but they really

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
deserve a

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,360
few pets on the back um because that

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
that really makes makes a sizable

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,840
difference i mean when i got involved in

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,600
open source getting a laptop to work

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,200
i mean i wrote blogs about it because it

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
was weeks of work

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
and now you can just buy one from dell

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
and lenova which are

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,200
you know huge companies so that's that's

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,440
really helpful i think

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,480
um but yeah for this

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
you have to offer a consistent single

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
platform

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,480
yeah having a single website

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
like if you want to develop for apple

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,080
you know you go to apple.com

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
developer or developer.apple.com

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,600
wherever they put it but there's one

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,399
place where you can get started

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,120
you know um and microsoft the same story

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,600
although they have i think 600 different

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,200
ui toolkits and everything but still it

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,480
there is one way

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,600
you can do it and on linux um there's a

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,679
way for now

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,760
but that ad will not be smooth on kde

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,320
and the other way around

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,360
um that's that's not good and that

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,159
should be fixed

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,880
i think because you're splintering a

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,000
platform

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,039
that is already tiny even further

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,360
i mean from a business point of view

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,080
any investment we do in the next support

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,039
is already

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,640
quite a stretch you know as you then

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,240
also have to do it for

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,640
two three four desktops

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,640
only crazy people do it we're crazy

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,919
luckily but you know most companies are

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,279
not and they don't

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,679
and yeah if you go beyond that i mean i

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,039
know

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,120
we've done a lot with things like um

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,039
you know flat pack and all these things

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,640
and that helps but they're also not

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,440
there yet

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
um you can't do browser integration uh

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,399
file manager integration for example

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,559
from a flat pack

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,640
yeah so if you get the the flat back or

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,760
the snap or or the app image from next

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
cloud

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
you don't get this nice right click menu

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,039
in your file manager

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,799
yeah that's and we can't really fix that

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,399
you know that's just a technical

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,320
limitation so there's also technical

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,440
barriers that

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,559
i mean again yeah

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,080
um that should get more attention

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,559
i think from the people who built the

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,559
platform

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,559
yeah please jump in um you can unmute

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
yourself and just go

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,080
all right so yeah i have thoughts on

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,679
this as well

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,960
um i think growth of the

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,240
linux platform in and of itself might be

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,240
a red herring

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,559
um you know we could

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,559
port the whole world to linux we could

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,640
have android apps and electron apps and

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,279
ios apps and windows apps and

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,159
we could grow the linux platform in that

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,039
way

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,520
but to have sustainable growth i think

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,600
you need to

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,720
actually have a platform and linux

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:37,200
is not a platform and

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,559
um which is fine like linux is

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
you know there's this open source

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,840
ecosystem there's this linux ecosystem

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,440
linux desktop ecosystem

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,120
but there's the gnome platform and

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,159
there's the kde platform and there's the

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,600
elementary platform

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,240
etc and we can all have similar and

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,000
overlapping

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,679
ideas and goals and opinions and go

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
about things different ways

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,679
but really i think to make a good

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,679
experience for both users and developers

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,240
you have to focus on growing

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,760
an actual platform i know that's hard to

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,520
hear because it also means

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,520
like you said kind of splintering the

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,039
linux ecosystem

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,840
further um but unless we say

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,120
all right let's you know let's kde gnome

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,120
elementary that's all join forces make

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,720
one distribution one toolkit one

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,600
platform which i don't think is going to

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
happen anytime soon

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,480
i think we really have to focus on those

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
individual platforms as separate

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,039
platforms

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,640
um and again we can still we can still

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,440
work together on things um

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,559
when it makes sense but i don't know if

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,240
it's realistic or worthwhile to say

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,919
i want an app for linux and

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,080
because that's so broad that that can

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,200
mean so many different form factors and

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,440
platforms

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
um whereas if you say i want an app for

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
kde

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,159
that's a that's a much better target you

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,080
know i want an app for elementary os

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,799
that's a much more simple target

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,840
um and for cross-platform apps they can

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,679
say i want an app

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
for kde and an app for elementor os and

00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
an app for gnome and those are three

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
different apps on three different

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,640
platforms

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,159
just like a windows app is different

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,559
from a mac os app is different from an

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,360
android app is different from an ios app

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,159
um so i don't know that it's realistic

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,279
in

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,840
for the foreseeable future to say a

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,240
linux

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,080
app is a singular app that works the

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,519
exact same everywhere

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
and i think we have to be okay with that

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,919
yeah but you can't justify spending time

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
on it

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
already you know with like a three

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,000
percent market share

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,240
um if you then cut that in four

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,919
it's even harder like like what person

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
in the business can go to the boss and

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,240
say hey we can sell

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,519
four percent more if i

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,440
uh if we do x amount of work like this

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,880
this is a conversation that happens if

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,200
you want third-party apps

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,360
i'm sure you know elementary and gnomon

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,720
kd can all build a new image viewer for

00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,480
themselves

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,240
fine but let's be honest that's not

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,760
gonna be helpful in day-to-day work a

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
lot uh

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,640
you also need more specialized apps and

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,120
if they

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,799
have to rewrite the app or at least do a

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
lot of work to target each of the

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,159
platforms then a lot of platforms aren't

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,600
going to get targeted

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,279
you know i mean you've seen this with

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,159
ubuntu i mean

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,640
most third-party applications think of

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
steam

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,080
they just say we support ubuntu if you

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,720
get it running on fedora and opensuse

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,360
good for you but we don't support it

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,399
goodbye

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,760
have a good day this because they just

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,559
target the biggest and that's reasonably

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,120
sensible

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,799
i think from a business point of view

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,000
you can say well we don't care about

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,480
that

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,919
all right then you know there aren't

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,080
going to be a lot of apps for you

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,080
and your users can then complain about

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,399
that but well that's because you

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,519
didn't want to build a platform that

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,480
works

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,480
for app developers

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:09,279
okay any uh final thoughts on this topic

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,279
now we can go on for

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,760
something i said in in chat that i think

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,519
is probably worth for

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,279
for some of the viewers who aren't

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,559
paying attention to chat

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,760
um that um

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,399
you know there's some tension between uh

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,760
cassidy saying you know nobody uses this

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,320
stuff because it's open they use it

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,720
because it's

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,159
you know high quality or whatever and

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,679
josh saying

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,039
uh only crazy people do this and then

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,720
pointing out that there are in fact

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,159
crazy people who do this right and the

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,480
motivation for those people

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,279
is almost always uh about it being

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
free open you know privacy protecting et

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,039
cetera right like there

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,120
are um you know if you i think if you

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,360
look at the history of this movement

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,360
um you know yes of course many of us

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,519
care and to reach a broad market

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,480
right i i you know i don't think

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,800
cassidy's wrong

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,320
right to reach more than the four

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,599
percent of the market or three percent

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,679
of the market or whatever

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,440
you do need to have a story that is

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,520
bigger than

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,720
hey you can you can open it up and see

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,000
what's inside

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,960
but at the same time i i

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,480
think it's it's a valuable tool that

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,919
free and open source

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,960
uh desktops have that

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,720
uh you know apple and microsoft don't is

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,839
this ideological motivation

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,280
right and so what do you

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,040
um how do you i've been trying to stay

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,119
away from crazy because

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,480
has all kinds of connotations but like

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,079
how do you

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,079
how do you cultivate and tend to

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,320
that group of people who do believe in

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,880
this ideological motivation

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,440
how do you grow that as sort of a sub

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,720
community within the larger community

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,000
because that's a potent powerful

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,480
intelligent caring group of people

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,160
uh that i think sometimes when we you

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,800
know we've had this pendulum about like

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,040
are we pragmatic are we ideological

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,280
like you know how do we make sure that

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,119
we're keeping some of those core values

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,359
there because they do motivate people

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,720
and they do you know it's really helpful

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,800
to have some people doing things for

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,920
irrational reasons if everybody's doing

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,440
it just for like

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,200
the cold sane you know and and here i am

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,960
at a vc-backed company right so i'm like

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,240
trying to do things for cold insane and

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,599
reasonable reasons

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,960
but like also you know that

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,720
that that additional push of i really

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,079
think it's the right thing to do

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,760
helps get some people out of bed in the

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
morning you know it helps

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
and if that helps people put in an extra

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,720
hour of marketing or coding or whatever

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,960
um that can be really powerful that adds

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,079
up over time and and so i would urge

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
everybody

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
uh watching this to make sure you do

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,640
have to have the

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,320
the cold pragmatic view but like also

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,839
figure out ways to nurture

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,280
and guard that ideological strand

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,280
right it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,400
the core of what we do but it does have

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
to be

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,440
uh it can be real and powerful if we

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
take it seriously

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,680
yeah thank you for that lewis um and

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,760
that kind of

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
leads into one of the questions that the

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,520
audience has

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,200
asked which is more oriented around

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,000
monetization

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,960
but it's about you know how how should

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,760
we start to monetize

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
and still respect open source and

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,880
privacy

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
um there are things like you know

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,599
advertisements donations

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,240
in-app purchases etc that can happen but

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,599
how can we

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,839
move towards this while still upholding

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,839
our fos values

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,440
so there's nothing inherently um

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,520
inherent about free noble social source

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,560
software that means you can't pay for it

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,680
right

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,160
um the

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,960
the and there's also this myth um daniel

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
for a

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,920
founder of elementary says there's this

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,440
myth that open source software is all

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
written by benevolent volunteers and

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,560
that funding the development of software

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,880
somehow corrupts it

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,920
um that's something we see a lot within

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,839
the really die hard

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,280
linux kind of places on the internet i

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,200
guess

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,520
and i think we need to get over that uh

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,640
we need to get over that

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,280
money somehow corrupts open source

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,280
software

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
or that you can't ask for money and we

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,040
need to be not we need to not be afraid

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,280
to build the tools

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,960
to allow users to give open source

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,240
projects money

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
right now that's i think one of the

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,520
biggest barriers is that you go to an

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
app store on your phone and you pay

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,760
money

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,200
for an app you pay a dollar or whatever

00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,119
or you sign up for a subscription

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,720
and it's really easy and simple but

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,880
there's no way to do that on the desktop

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
at least broadly right now you know with

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,160
elementary app center we've started in

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
that direction but gnome software and kd

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
discover

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,520
as far as i know there's no way just to

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,520
go click a button and pay a dollar

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,640
so i think we really need to focus on on

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,640
those pieces of building the tools to

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,320
allow people to to give open source

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,640
projects money and i don't think that

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,680
is in conflict whatsoever with the free

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,680
and open source values

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
okay so you know talking about ways that

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
we

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,440
can um monetize and create rewards

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,040
for you know um the development to

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
continue the creation of apps to

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,119
continue and then also

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,160
um you know for sustainability i'm

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,200
wondering what

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,000
uh what are you all you know using for

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,520
yourselves

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,160
and what are some ways that we can

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,440
continue to

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,720
make the application of or sorry the

00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,520
development of applications more

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,280
sustainable

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,800
you know some of you you know like lewis

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,720
are involved directly in

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,480
helping um the foss ecosystem be more

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,000
sustainable so can you tell us a little

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,480
bit more about that and

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,480
your thoughts

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,480
yeah sure i mean let me give the sort of

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,000
basic

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,440
tide lift elevator pitch which is

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,400
that uh but it's focused on libraries

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,520
right so like our basic observation is

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,359
that

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,119
all big uh companies are now software

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,880
companies and all software companies are

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,920
open source companies

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,960
and so you know literally a

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,480
trillion dollar industry built on top of

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
open source

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,400
uh and yet at the same time piles of

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,760
this open source that these companies

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,640
rely on

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,320
uh becomes unmaintained every year

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,599
because people aren't paid directly to

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,079
work on it

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,160
and so they get a new job or they get a

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,240
puppy or they get a toddler

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,400
and all of a sudden this side project

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,960
becomes much less important

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,400
and uh then the side product when the

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,359
side project becomes important

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,000
it eventually gains security problems

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,119
it's just as

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,800
important to new apis etc etc etc i

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,760
think everybody here

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,040
understands that basic cycle so our

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,400
observation

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,720
um inspired in part by red hat which my

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,520
other co-founders are all uh x red hat

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,760
people i'm

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,760
technically x red hat but i spent more

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,800
time at souza than i did it

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,640
uh ever at um the

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,359
the observation was if we can measure

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,400
this we can capture what people are

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,119
doing

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
and pay out based on that it's almost

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,760
you know for those of you who are

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,240
familiar with like spotify

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,000
and how they pay artists similar to that

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,720
the the intuition is

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,440
we capture what you're actually using uh

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,319
we measure that and we redistribute the

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,520
money you've paid

00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,640
us to developers who uh

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,480
whose software is being used and we do

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,800
that based on

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,560
we do that based on essentially i mean

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,599
the short version of it is analysis of

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,720
your package manager metadata

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,240
and uh oh and we require the developers

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
to do basic stuff around security

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,760
licensing all that

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,720
basically the enterprise stuff that is

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,000
sort of boring

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,400
that is not something you'd want to do

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,520
on a saturday morning for fun

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,839
um and you know we turn that into a

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,359
revenue stream

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,599
the challenge for this audience

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,079
unfortunately is that we just don't see

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,599
enough usage of free software at the

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,839
application layer

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,720
and we don't have a way to track it

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,079
right and so

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,280
our model at least as of yet doesn't

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,359
really

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,480
allow us to say for example um

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,960
you know are you using the firefox web

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,720
browser which is free versus the chrome

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,839
web chrome browser which is free and

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,520
you know donate revenue based on uh

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:06,800
you know based on that usage right and

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,640
so it's a tough uh you know

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,839
and especially for organizations that

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,319
are still primarily

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,240
at the desktop level they're they're

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,079
everybody's an open source software

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,760
organization at this point but that's

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,240
all on the back end right

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,200
that's not what developers are using in

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,520
their day-to-day

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,040
primarily it's not what the business

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,079
people in the organization are using

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,880
day-to-day

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,560
and so extending that pitch up the stack

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,480
um

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,400
we would love to do it at some point but

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,280
we don't see you know quite where it

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,359
fits

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,880
uh yet in our model which is really

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,319
unfortunate because

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
you know several of us one of my other

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,040
co-founders is havoc pennington

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,640
who some of you may recognize from

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,800
uh you know this digital docs on

00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,160
freedesktop.org

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,359
uh you may have seen his name in uh

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,800
you know those kinds of things um yeah

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,520
so it is a hard fit

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,079
right i do wonder you know having also

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,359
worked at mozilla and at wikipedia

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,119
i do have to i do always wonder

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:11,440
whether or not some of that more

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,319
user focused as opposed to you know at

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,079
the end of the day our

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,319
tide lifts business is very enterprise

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,640
focused right we are here to

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,599
get dollars from very big enterprise

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,920
companies

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,960
and turn that into money for developers

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,160
i do wonder

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,040
you know wikipedia certainly to a

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,400
great success mozilla to less but still

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,720
not zero success

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,480
has turned their user bases their human

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,440
user bases not their enterprise user

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,760
bases

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,079
uh into revenue streams and i do wonder

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,839
if that's a more fruitful path

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,240
for uh you know for these communities

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,440
here

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,440
right for ganon kde

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,680
yeah anybody else on thoughts i know

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,839
cassidy you've

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,200
uh elementary has the app store so jump

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:02,800
in

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,400
yeah so um especially the tide lift

00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,000
model is really interesting and i've

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,280
always been really fascinated by that

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,720
um on the the desktop i think it's

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,079
really interesting because i don't i

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,520
don't want to take all of the underlying

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,640
work that goes into

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,119
the desktop for granted but there are

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,319
very

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,520
very large successful companies who are

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,040
very invested

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,319
in maintaining and improving the

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,000
linux plumbing in general so i think uh

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,560
it's important not to get bogged down

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,760
in you know how can we ensure that every

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,480
purchase of this app

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
written by a starving developer also

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,760
goes and pays for the linux kernel

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,520
because those are all those are very two

00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,359
very different um

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,720
developers or development you know

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,920
people

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,200
in very different situations

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,800
and i think as as the ecosystem grows

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,319
uh there will be opportunities to

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,160
reinvest revenue

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,680
once we actually have revenue for these

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,040
apps uh

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
there will be opportunities to reinvest

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,160
that into the ecosystem to make sure

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,240
that our interests as

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,640
you know platforms for apps are well

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,839
represented within the linux desktop

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,000
but i don't think we can pretend it's

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,200
equivalent to say you know for a one

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,079
dollar app from somebody who's just

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,960
trying to make rent

00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,640
this month um that you need to make sure

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,119
that whatever percentage of the linux

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,200
kernel

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,640
gets funded and whichever percentage of

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,240
glib gets funded

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,760
from that one purchase of that one

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,839
dollar app from somebody who's

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,839
otherwise not making any money um

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,000
i i i sorry louis please go first

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
uh yeah i just was a real quick point

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,560
which is that

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,720
you know the only reason we believe that

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,960
that kind of trickle down

00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,319
uh works in the server space is because

00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,040
there's a lot of money in the server

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,599
space completely agree with cassidy that

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,000
that on the desktop space taking a small

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,720
pie and subdividing it into even smaller

00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,880
slices

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,640
is is a very tough sell i mean it's

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,240
tough enough in the server space and it

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,240
would be very hard in the desktop space

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,400
yeah exa i basically am completely on

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,640
board with cassidy and louise

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,210
on this it's this is going to be quite

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,640
hard on the desktop on the other hand

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:19,680
[Music]

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,079
a part of it is that the pi is small

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,200
and there's a lot of money in the server

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,760
okay

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,720
but if the pi were bigger as in if there

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,800
was more use

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,079
obviously there would also be simply

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,119
more money

00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:37,280
now i again i'm biased

00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:40,240
at next cloud we have internally

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,200
tried looked at over the years various

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,560
business models

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,920
and we really do not believe

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,079
that there is much

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,119
room for earning money on private users

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,040
there are a lot

00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,280
of private users of next cloud like

00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,480
really a lot there are about 300 to four

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,160
hundred thousand next file

00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,640
servers on the internet so people

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,440
running an excel server

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,280
um and that's obviously the vast

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,960
majority of that is just private people

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,520
running it on on an old desktop or

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,359
raspberry pi or vps somewhere

00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,520
and we try to do a lot to make their

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,599
life easier to make it easy to update

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,720
to make it easy to find it download it

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,079
run it

00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,160
and we do not do anything to try to

00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,240
monetize that we really try

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,440
any idea that comes up internally that

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,760
boils down to

00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,520
make money on private use we say ah

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,200
let's not try that please

00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,000
because we think that it is far easier

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,440
and more effective to try and monetize

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,040
bigger companies

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,640
and i think that same can be true for

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,800
the desktop i mean

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,319
if big companies they also need the

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,880
desktop right and they are currently

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,680
paying

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,599
for that that's in the end what it boils

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,839
down to there is money getting paid for

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,400
for windows and mac os

00:47:53,839 --> 00:48:01,599
indirectly in case of macos but still um

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,920
and okay then you have a bit of a

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,960
problem kind of a chicken egg issue

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,079
i think where um right now there's just

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,040
no

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,720
not not enough of a movement there that

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,160
that you can build a business on it i

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,559
know both red hat

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,359
and souza tried to to have their you

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,000
know

00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,520
linux enterprise desktop i think and

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,119
rather than the private linux i guess

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,040
desktop too

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,880
they both tried this and i think there

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,200
was definitely some money made

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,880
but not enough to really sustain it and

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,400
to really build up

00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,160
a bigger you know pie basically now part

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,920
of that is probably that you know i

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,559
guess at some point i'm sure susan went

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,880
for kd

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,079
and red hat for gnome which is like huh

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,400
okay do you have to split

00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,880
efforts there but right this is i guess

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,079
um how this works and you can debate for

00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
a long time whether

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,359
that was smart or not and how what that

00:48:52,240 --> 00:49:02,400
did but didn't help i'm sure

00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:03,920
um but then even if you can um back to i

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,359
think the challenge is the chicken egg

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
here because there just isn't enough

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,520
critical mass to do this

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,440
now one thing i believe is that there's

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,400
quite a bit of interest from government

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,520
interestingly

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,079
in in pushing open source for privacy

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,319
reasons

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,839
for digital sovereignty reasons which is

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,559
a fancy term that throw around

00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,760
these days which just means controlling

00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,599
your computing

00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,880
which is obviously what free software is

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,440
all about when you go

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,240
back to the basics it's about you the

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,920
person

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,079
who or organization that runs the

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,160
software controlling it

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,680
and that is indeed really important and

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,079
then right now we're in the situation

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,920
where

00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,599
half the world is running software that

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,040
is developed in

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:48,000
pretty much one area of the world and

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,000
you know whether that's good or bad

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,359
there's definitely some inherent risk in

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,520
that i think

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,960
and open source is a prime way of fixing

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,680
that problem

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,720
but of course governments tend to love

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,240
to

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:05,359
invest through complicated

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,000
you know grant and all that stuff and

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,400
i'm very skeptical of that i mean it can

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,200
work

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,640
i guess but often you know getting money

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,800
for six months

00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,720
and then it disappears again this is not

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,760
how you build a sustainable

00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,680
open source project so

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,800
a better way would actually be if

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,000
government would

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,839
do what it preaches and what you see

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
right now is that governments all over

00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,400
the world are putting millions

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:37,680
billions into proprietary software

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,640
how about stop doing that

00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,040
and put that money in open source that

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,440
would

00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,880
definitely in terms of size of the pie

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,880
completely

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,480
solve the money problem because there is

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,960
more than enough money spent

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,880
in one year just by europe on microsoft

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,400
office licenses

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,720
i mean there's more money going into

00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,079
that than i think all of open source

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,040
on the desktop and even the whole stack

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,400
below it

00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,960
spends in the decade so there's money

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,640
it's just being spent on well it's

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,480
basically just going to shareholders

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,079
because of course it's not like

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,760
microsoft is spending more than one

00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,119
percent of the money that's being paid

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,400
for microsoft office onto the

00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,640
development of it

00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,520
right this is the the margins are insane

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:25,200
uh so i don't know i'm kind of hopeful

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,839
that at some point government will wake

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,160
up and think

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,520
huh so right now we're spending i don't

00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,000
know 10 billion a year

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,760
in just one country on licenses for

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,880
something that actually could be

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,160
developed for

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,680
of a billion in one year or two

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:45,599
how about maybe do that instead

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:47,839
um i don't know it's it's it's one thing

00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,040
i'm i'm hoping for i mean after all you

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,040
know we thought

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,400
at least i thought for a long time that

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,880
you know

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,440
no hardware vendor of the size of dell

00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:01,359
or lenovo is ever gonna ship

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,720
you know uh open source desktop software

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,559
ever and they do today so who knows

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,040
maybe governments will also wake up

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,040
someday

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,160
yeah i think that's a really interesting

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,160
point um

00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,400
you know having worked at endless for a

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,280
while we did actually approach

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,200
government organizations and i know that

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,000
there are some governments that have

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,880
you know started to use more open source

00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,359
or they have

00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
budget for open source but at the end of

00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,480
the day you need

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,680
support for it you need people that are

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,359
like actively there

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,720
like doing business development and

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,960
those relationships take

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,240
a lot of time because government moves

00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,839
really slow

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,160
and i think that's one of the reasons

00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,240
why i personally feel really

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,160
passionate about this topic because i

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,359
think that it's a great training ground

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,319
for people who

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,920
have um business development skills or

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,640
sales or want to like

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,520
go into like people who are not thought

00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,839
of as the

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,440
traditional open source contributor can

00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,480
do so much to help

00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,720
um i know uh alberto ruiz had been

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,839
you know really great at helping us find

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,760
opportunities

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,119
that you know we hadn't thought of at

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,680
gnome and those are

00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,880
incredibly valuable um we need to get

00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,839
more people

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,079
who want to do that who excel in doing

00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:22,880
that who are very people skill oriented

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,720
to go and form these relationships with

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,079
governments and other

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,640
you know organizations so totally agree

00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,559
with you

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,920
and then i think that the challenge that

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,960
we have again is around

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,720
service and support because at least in

00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,240
my experience that is something that

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,079
governments expect

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,800
um and uh that can be quite

00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,800
quite a lot of work and you know in a

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,520
volunteer-based organization

00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,760
or mostly volunteer based you know it's

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,760
a little difficult

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,119
i mean to elaborate on those for to

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
elaborate on that thought a little bit

00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,720
for people in the audience who haven't

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,559
worked at those kinds of companies

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,319
it's not just that it's hard it's that

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,440
it's hard to scale

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,319
right something that we have used to our

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,160
to our benefit in open source is hey a

00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,000
handful of us write software and it gets

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,160
used everywhere

00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,079
and you know new users does not

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,920
necessarily mean

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,680
i mean it does in some cases but it

00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,280
doesn't necessarily mean more burden on

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,359
the developers

00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,640
more users definitely means more burden

00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,040
on support right

00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,240
and that's where like support contracts

00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,839
and

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,520
enterprise class support is it's not

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,880
just that it's hard to do well

00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,359
it's that when you add a new customer

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,920
you've also got to hire and train

00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,680
and deploy a new support person and you

00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,160
the next customer means the next you

00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,920
know

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,240
and that's something that is not um

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,040
to get back to where the conversation

00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,960
started

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,319
that's something that needs money right

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,559
like that is an eye

00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:56,240
you can't really do that uh support

00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,559
uh that kind of support on a volunteer

00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,559
basis

00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,359
yeah and then i think this just to

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,040
combine

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,680
you know both points that were just

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,440
being made

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,559
i think there's also a bit of a sales

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,160
pitch slash attitude issue here because

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,240
of course

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,359
one argument for open source that's used

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,319
very often is

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,920
it's cheap or it's free which is a

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,160
horrible argument if you're trying to

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,079
make a business right this is just

00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:33,119
killing i mean so often our sales team

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,319
and they're doing amazing work but so

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,240
often

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,799
the main argument that the customer

00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,359
internally has used to deploy next cloud

00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,400
was

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,880
save money that

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,119
that that kills any opportunity for us

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,720
to build a healthy business that way

00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,040
and the problem is of course a lot of

00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,400
people who love open source and try to

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,440
promote it

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,079
will also use this argument which is

00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,079
quite awful

00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,520
and that's where somebody mentioned in

00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,880
chat uh the public money

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,720
uh public source um

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,319
argument that fsf europe has been

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,359
deploying a lot lately and i think

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,480
that's a

00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:17,920
terrific message and goes to your point

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,680
joseph of the european union

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,839
yeah okay and

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,880
i know we only have a few minutes left

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,559
um i

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,319
they're i'm not sure this is the best

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,119
suited for this group but

00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,319
um you know it has been identified that

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,440
we need to have

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,680
more emphasis on you know a

00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,359
place a space beyond the linux app

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,079
summit where we can collaborate

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,359
all together you know freedesktop.org

00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,599
has been named

00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:51,040
um as i guess something that we can try

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,760
to amplify or to extend something like

00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,280
that

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,799
and um you know do you all have ideas

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,960
for how we can continue this

00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,599
conversation beyond

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,599
this space

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,640
or how to keep collaborating

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,119
yeah i think honestly i think free

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,079
desktop

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,160
um it gets a bad rap of you know it's

00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,400
not a standards body it's not

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,280
an enforcement agency or anything like

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,640
that

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:28,000
um but there's still a lot of really

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,000
good stuff there um

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,839
free desktop existing is why there is

00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,319
some amount of intercompatibility

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,640
between

00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,440
desktops like when you click an icon it

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,160
opens an app

00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,640
like fundamental things like that um so

00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,119
i

00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,480
personally i think free desktop is is

00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,960
probably still the best route

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,000
um i think it needs maybe to be

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,960
revitalized

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,160
and um maybe repositioned a little bit

00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,359
as far as

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,480
what its goals are and um you know how

00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,160
active things are and

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,440
who's involved with those efforts um

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,680
but yeah having having

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,799
intercompatibility between desktops does

00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,680
does improve things and it lets us all

00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,119
kind of

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,280
have our own visions for what the

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,599
desktop is

00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,680
while not totally wasting resources

00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,760
reinventing the wheel every time

00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:23,839
so yeah personally i'm a big fan of the

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,839
free desktop angle

00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:39,280
a community at sustainoss.org including

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:42,160
um a uh including a semi-active

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,079
uh discourse forum uh that is a

00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,200
gathering hole for people

00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,359
trying to do the money uh

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,319
and sustainability in open source

00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,079
discussion

00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,079
it's very uh

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,559
library and developer-centric but could

00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,480
certainly

00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,000
for folks around here who are interested

00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,559
in the space it's certainly a great

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,680
community of people um

00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,440
i s i yes they they were trying to do

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,040
meetups twice a year actually the last

00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,160
thing i did i think sheree was saying

00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,640
this in chat

00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,400
uh the last thing that i did before

00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,359
everything got locked down was go to

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,599
sustain

00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:21,359
and uh you know i assume they'll be

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,000
doing some online stuff as well there's

00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,599
also

00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
several people doing podcasts around the

00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,520
space that may be interesting for the

00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,520
audience here

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,839
yeah i want a second that i actually

00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,280
myself have that on my to-do list to get

00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:36,160
more involved because i think that

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,920
there's

00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:43,520
a lot of um just great people from both

00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,040
um corporations and more traditional or

00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,680
just open source projects

00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,119
that are working together on this and um

00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,640
i think it's a great

00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,680
place to get involved i see that you

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,920
added another

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,119
link in there louis i don't know the

00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,960
public code.eu

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,720
is just for those who were the public

00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,480
money public code slogan that i

01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,319
mentioned

01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,079
publiccode.edu is a site uh with

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:07,920
materials and discussion of that

01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,760
of that slogan i also want to say

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,119
actually and this relates to

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:16,400
uh joss's point about

01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,240
free software is is low cost

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,319
i will say actually my one concern with

01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,480
the sustain oss community

01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,520
is that often everything is phrased as a

01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,119
donation

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,040
and there are certain contexts where

01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,280
donations work

01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,280
um you know like i mentioned earlier for

01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,400
wikipedia donations work

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,319
uh but i actually uh actually my biggest

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,720
concern with the sustain oss crowd is

01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,319
that

01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,000
that the large amount of corporate

01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:43,040
participation

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,079
uh for the corporate folks they never

01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,160
want to buy anything

01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,359
they always want to donate and there's a

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,920
reason for that

01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,119
and that's because uh they can turn off

01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,720
donations whenever

01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,839
they can feel good about donations

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,559
without actually building a sustainable

01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:58,799
community and

01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,000
um i think that's a message that we all

01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,520
need to push back on

01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,640
right that this is uh i suppose

01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,280
yeah but you know i mean taxes is yeah i

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,960
mean it's

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,480
but it's not quite taxes it's like

01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,760
voluntary it's like

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:16,880
oh look there's a saying in the

01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,599
u.s nonprofit world of oh i gave at the

01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,079
office

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,079
right it's like this idea that you you

01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,359
donated once and so now you don't have

01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,520
to think about it again

01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,799
right and you'll see this there are a

01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,760
couple big companies

01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,880
in the sustained ecosystem uh or the

01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,720
sustained community

01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,160
who have made these big public

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,079
pronouncements of

01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,559
oh we donate ten thousand dollars a

01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,799
month to one open source project

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,160
and like and guess what ten thousand

01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,200
dollars once

01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:48,079
is not sustainability right that is a

01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,799
that is that that makes you feel better

01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:55,520
but doesn't actually help that community

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,839
but there's also not much money i mean

01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,680
we

01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,200
we get companies that reach out to us

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,280
sometimes like yeah yeah

01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,640
you know yeah we like next files we want

01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,920
to support it you know we have a

01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,760
donation

01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,599
and then we send them a quote and the

01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,240
quote is easily a hundred times what

01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,480
they were even considering to donate

01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,920
and i'm like yeah but like our engineers

01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,640
get a normal salary

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,559
they don't get like five percent because

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,920
they happen to do open source

01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:25,200
okay i can't charge you 5k a year

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:27,520
when you would pay 500k a year

01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,240
for a solution from a proprietary

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,200
company

01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,960
why are we even having this conversation

01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,480
and this is

01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,400
yeah this is not helpful and

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,079
yeah it's in part to need to change the

01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,319
conversation i mean companies have made

01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,280
progress here i think a lot of companies

01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,160
and governments they used to consider uh

01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,319
free software

01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,680
like freeware and they had a rule

01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:51,200
against freeware

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,359
and then they killed and they said no

01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,599
open source okay that time

01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,799
is luckily passed where in 2020 this was

01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,839
01:02:56,799 --> 01:03:01,839
or something um and then

01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,319
they used it but they saw it still as

01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:06,079
like free you know it doesn't cost money

01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:07,760
and this is something we still need to

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,079
get rid of and then we need to teach

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,160
them

01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,359
by the way that when you run open source

01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,839
software you

01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,960
should get a support contract and then

01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,720
we're going to have to teach them you

01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,200
should get a support contract

01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,200
with the people who built the software

01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,960
not some random third-party company on

01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,799
the internet that just happens to know

01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,720
how to configure the software

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,920
once but can't actually help you when

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,240
something breaks

01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,839
like all these things are also a matter

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:35,280
of communicating

01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,839
and teaching um big companies and

01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,559
governments to understand

01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:42,319
um you know how how open source business

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,359
works and honestly

01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:47,119
once 80 percent of the fortune 500s

01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:48,640
has an internal policy that when they

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,960
use open source to get a support

01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,799
contract with the vendor

01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,039
i think running an open source business

01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,319
even for desktop software will become a

01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,760
whole lot easier

01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:03,359
because suddenly you can just say look

01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,200
i make this application be it a krita

01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,480
you know like a drawing application or

01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,200
just a desktop

01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,640
and you know there's an internal policy

01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,960
if you use it

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,000
and rely on it you want to have a

01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,359
contract

01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,359
excellent we offer that contract and

01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,200
for the server side this is what lewis

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,960
is kind of doing of course offering this

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,000
from what i understand

01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:28,640
um for the desktop yeah

01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,079
we need to teach a lot still really a

01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,440
lot

01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,000
yeah all right well i'm sorry to do this

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,760
but

01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
we're out of time so we're going to have

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,359
to continue this conversation

01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,039
in the hallway or um you know i

01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,400
have seen some people post that they're

01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,480
going or promise they're going to have

01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,960
blog posts coming out sometimes so keep

01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,079
an eye

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:53,440
out for those thank you so much for

01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,960
joining um this panel and there's lots

01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,319
happening in the chat so if you haven't

01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,640
had a chance to look at that

01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:00,720
please do and i'm sure there will be a

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,559
lot of follow-up also exploring the free

01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,760
desktop option that we've mentioned a

01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,559
couple of times

01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,119
um i will end it at that thank you so

01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,960
much

01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,960
and allison back to you

01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,960
thanks so much thank you it was great

01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,960
hearing from all of you

01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,960
thank you so much for being here today

01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,599
up next on our

01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,359
great uh schedule for today is a

01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,880
lightning talk

01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:37,039
uh by alexander

01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:40,160
alex are you here with us

01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,799
yeah i'm here right

01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,960
i think i need to be made producer

01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:48,079
presenter too

01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,839
you are um let's get your slides

01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,799
uploaded and you can start whenever

01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,799
you're ready alex

01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,839
alright

01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,839
oh wow that doesn't look very good

01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,640
oh well uh so can you well so it's

01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,520
supposed to

01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:30,839
like the gray triangles are supposed to

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:33,839
be like alpha blended and stuff but

01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,839
whatever

01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,200
all right i guess we'll start this is

01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,119
where

01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,720
um so that's going to be a pretty short

01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,760
talk uh

01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:00,000
focusing on like non-technical stuff for

01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,359
flat packs seen from the perspective of

01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,200
uh like an

01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,599
application developer and not

01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,480
necessarily an end user

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,280
so i think most people know what

01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,760
flatback is

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,240
it's kind of an app store system so i'm

01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,799
not gonna talk too much about that

01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,680
because most much more interesting than

01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:21,760
what it is is

01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:23,440
why it is uh i had like a bunch of

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,000
high level goals that are not really

01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,000
technical

01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:31,119
then are more of a

01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,200
solution to how things work in the

01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:36,799
community and how we develop on the on

01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,960
the linux desktop that i wanted to fix

01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,839
and the first the first goal i had was

01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,000
to improve the user developer

01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,680
interaction

01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,200
in the traditional model and whenever i

01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,520
say traditional here i kind of mean the

01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,920
distro model

01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,880
if you are an app developer and you want

01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,640
to do a release

01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,160
you put a toggle somewhere and you send

01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,720
a bunch of mails and tell a bunch of

01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,920
people

01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,720
about it and then you sit back and wait

01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,680
for distro to find your tarball package

01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,760
it up and release it to user

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,039
this sometimes happens directly

01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,839
sometimes

01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,760
like you have to wait a long time and

01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,400
then your users get it they notice it

01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,400
crashes

01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,760
i mean there's a software it happens you

01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,759
report it upstream

01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,120
or you you report it to your distro

01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,640
typically

01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,239
and and there you have like some

01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,159
overloaded uh

01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,159
distro maintainer that eventually sees

01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:27,920
your bug notice that it's like an

01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,960
upstream issue so you follow the

01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:34,080
bug upstream and then you can see it and

01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,520
then you can fix it hopefully

01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,239
and there are a bunch of issues with

01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,719
this the most obvious one is that you

01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,080
might

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:45,359
not get your app packaged like

01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:49,199
maybe it's just too french

01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:52,239
for for most that's just to care

01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:55,359
or maybe just you know takes forever

01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:57,600
for it to get packaged maybe your users

01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,400
are on debian stable and debian stable

01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,000
don't get updates until like

01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,319
a stable release which is every four

01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,319
years or whatever

01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,799
and and if you do get packaged and

01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:11,679
and have feedback it gets delayed

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,880
because this

01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:17,040
there's this intermediate but the

01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,679
maintainer of the distro that has to

01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,520
uh handle all the input and once you get

01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,279
it it's delayed

01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,520
it might be hard to reach the individual

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,480
or the the the user that

01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,600
filed the bug or or maybe he found a bug

01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,279
against the current

01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,199
package version which is something you

01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,679
fixed a bunch

01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:39,120
bunch of fixes long time ago but you

01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:40,880
know the users don't see that

01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,040
so so the goal with the flatback model

01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,319
is that you are in control of releasing

01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,839
to users

01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,679
so when you release something because

01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,799
you fix the bug it goes directly to the

01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,120
user

01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,880
and the users report things directly to

01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,239
you and

01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,120
you get like non-stale

01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:00,800
information directly from the user and

01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,840
if you fix something you can push a fix

01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,000
the same day and you have the user just

01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,880
run update and verify that it's got

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,080
fixed so

01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,080
so there's a lot more advantages here

01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:16,080
not only the obvious one that you can

01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,159
reach all the users but it's also like a

01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,800
much saner way to interact with users

01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:22,000
that that

01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:24,320
that can improve

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,719
the community and and the way we develop

01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,719
software

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,880
you know we can basically make better

01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,199
software if we have a better interaction

01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,199
model

01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,960
so the second goal is to separate the

01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,159
apps

01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,880
from the operating system on no other

01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,199
system

01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,280
does like the app come with a system

01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:49,360
uh but in the district model everything

01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,960
is a package the os is a package the

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,560
apps are a package and everything comes

01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,760
with the operating system

01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,520
and if it doesn't come with the

01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,320
operating system it's just not there

01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,960
it's just not possible

01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,640
so there's some obvious problems with

01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,120
this you can only use the things that

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,480
are packaged

01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,760
and that's what people notice but

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:13,040
there's also other issues that that

01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,600
affect how the community works like

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,120
you can only like you're you're not just

01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,440
limited to using the apps that are

01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:23,440
packaged you're also limited

01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:26,239
to using the distros that have the apps

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,480
like you can't pick a random new distro

01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,400
if it doesn't have all the apps you need

01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,719
and that means all the gestures have to

01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,400
package all the apps

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,480
and there's a lot of there's a lot of

01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,159
work in in making a distro there's a lot

01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,600
of interesting stuff happening in the

01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,800
overspace

01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,280
but it gets drowned by this

01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,480
requirement for everyone to package

01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,199
everything

01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,640
that just makes it hard to innovate or

01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:54,880
work on the interesting part of

01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,159
operating system development

01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,320
if you were to use something like

01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,640
flatback instead

01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,360
you could share the work of maintaining

01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,800
and and

01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:07,520
the apps so like the upstream

01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,520
of the apps do the work of packaging and

01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,920
the distribution can focus on

01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,159
what's actually interested in the

01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,560
distribution world

01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:18,560
i think that's you know

01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,239
much more important actually than the

01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:25,520
availability

01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:27,040
of all the apps and all the distros

01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,040
but we can separate these things and

01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,080
make them to they are not the same we

01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,400
should they should be two different

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,400
things

01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,719
so the other thing is that we want to

01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,679
protect users and

01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,600
linux is the unix and unix is

01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,679
historically considered a

01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,760
secure operating system and i mean

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,640
that's not wrong

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,520
it has a bunch of security features it's

01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,440
just that those

01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,719
features are not necessarily what you

01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,679
want

01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:58,159
um their goal is to make you not be able

01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,080
to install printer drivers

01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,600
like if we're talking about the modern

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,480
laptop where you run in your personal

01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,679
system

01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:08,800
the only like thing that

01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:11,760
that the unix multi-user

01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,560
system like permission system brings you

01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,960
is you can't do

01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,320
stuff that you would like to it doesn't

01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,040
actually protect you

01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,640
in the way you'd expect it to do right

01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,640
if you run a game that you just

01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,400
downloaded you don't want it to be able

01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,719
to read your mail

01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,159
or you know see your bitcoin or what

01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,239
have you i mean it's just

01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,600
there's no isolation whatsoever to

01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,159
protect you

01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,640
from or your data which is what you have

01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,440
on your

01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,640
uh in your home directory basically from

01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,120
the app or for

01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,400
for or protect the data of one app from

01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,320
another

01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,159
there just isn't any in the traditional

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,239
unix environment

01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,640
so what we want is the way to isolate an

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:53,040
app so that it cannot

01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,159
affect things that we don't want it to

01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,360
but also

01:13:54,159 --> 01:14:01,360
we can control what it does

01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:03,600
and and you know ensure it it doesn't

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,560
you know send spam on the network or

01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,920
whatever if we don't want it to

01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,120
uh obviously we have a you know

01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,440
30 year old history of software and it's

01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,640
not

01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,480
meant to be sandboxed so all

01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,960
software that we have is not going to

01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,120
work in a sandbox environment so we've

01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,719
flatback has a very pragmatic approach

01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,040
to this where you can punch hold in the

01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,880
sandbox

01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,800
and you know a lot of people get us give

01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,000
us a lot of flack about that but

01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,600
in practice it's more interesting to be

01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,920
able to use apps

01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,920
than not uh but you know long term

01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,440
we want to make the sandboxing solution

01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,840
work

01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,640
you know as well as possible so that

01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,400
apps can

01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,840
migrate to that model

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,600
so those are like kind of like the high

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,040
level goals and

01:14:53,600 --> 01:15:00,800
i want to continue with some you know

01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,800
concepts and ideas that you get

01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,520
that you will see a lot when you start

01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:09,760
developing on flat pack

01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:11,199
so the first concept is that of runtimes

01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,800
applications depend on something called

01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:16,719
a runtime which is really

01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:18,960
just a word for shared dependencies

01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,719
and dependencies are things like files

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,600
like you have a library file that you

01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:23,440
share

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,440
and sharing it means you know we only

01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:29,120
store it once

01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,719
uh both in disk and in the disk cache

01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,239
but it also means that you can share the

01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,960
maintenance of

01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:35,840
the core dependencies like you app

01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,159
developer

01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,040
aren't necessarily super interested in

01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,840
in

01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,120
you know glibc versioning or hardcore

01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,360
low level features like

01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:50,800
how you make the gl drivers work

01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,480
so forcing those on apps bad developers

01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,040
would be a bad thing so runtimes is a

01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,640
way

01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:58,239
we can avoid that and shared maintenance

01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,719
and they're parallel installable

01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:02,400
or version you can have money of them

01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,360
each individual app

01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,760
can test against one and choose when

01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,600
they want to update to the new version

01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,199
not there's no flag day where everyone

01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,719
has to move or anything like that

01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:17,280
it's up to each individual maintainer

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,560
and if you do get updates there

01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:21,280
separately so like

01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,679
even an app that doesn't get updates

01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,239
gets

01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,760
update for the runtime which is where

01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,440
most of the core

01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,920
security problems might show up so

01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,920
that's good

01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,400
another concept that we see a lot is

01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,120
sandboxes and

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,560
the the flat pack sandboxes are built on

01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,880
something called bubble wrap

01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,719
which is really just a command line

01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,480
interface to the kernel apis that we

01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,239
have for these

01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:50,400
c groups namespaces setcomp that kind of

01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:53,600
stuff

01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,520
it's similar to what docker uses the

01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,199
the main difference is that we have

01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,480
automatic integration with all this

01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,199
kind of stuff that the that the desktop

01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,159
requires

01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,560
it's you sets up all these sockets and

01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:08,320
it has

01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:11,840
filter d bus access and and you know

01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,239
it sets up dry drivers in the right way

01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,199
and all those kind of low level things

01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:19,920
that apps eventually will need and then

01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:22,560
we have the concept of permissions which

01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,480
really is just about punching holes in

01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,719
the sandbox right so

01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,239
we show you during installation this app

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,719
will require these holes

01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,880
if that's okay you can install it you

01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,640
can actually then override it even

01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,719
even though you your app required

01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,360
network access you can then override it

01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,920
to not let it have it i mean

01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,560
practices probably just breaks the app

01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,760
but you know

01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:48,719
it is possible uh

01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,679
but those are kind of static permissions

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,560
that are set on

01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,640
uh on launching of the sandbox we also

01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,080
have something called portals

01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,880
and portals is more like a name for a

01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,320
concept

01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,679
of dynamic permissions uh

01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,520
where you have something running outside

01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,080
the app that

01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,679
does interaction with the user and

01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:12,719
controls the access

01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,960
to things like uh

01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,960
you know do you want do you want the app

01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,719
to have access to a camera

01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,679
the camera portal would be something

01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:25,199
that asks the user to pick a camera

01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:27,920
and and then this

01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:30,000
interaction grants permissions to the

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,400
calling app

01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,560
um you know the most commonly used

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,719
example is the file chooser where

01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,360
the entire file user would run outside

01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:43,199
of the app and only the final

01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:43,199
selection will be passed back to the app

01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,400
flatback builder is a tool we have which

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,960
is how most

01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,560
flatback apps are built it's not really

01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,560
a core part of flap pack

01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,120
you can and and some do build flatbacks

01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,360
in other ways

01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,640
like basically since it's just a file

01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,719
you can a bunch of files you can

01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,199
basically

01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,719
create a bunch of binaries in the right

01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,880
directory and

01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:14,719
choose a flat pack but most things use

01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,719
flatback builder

01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,640
it has a json or jaml manifest

01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:24,000
it builds stuff using flat packs so it's

01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:26,320
very reproducible it runs on any distro

01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,040
it uses runtimes again to build although

01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,480
they

01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:32,480
they are a custom style of of runtimes

01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:35,520
called sdk which is

01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:40,159
you know full of development

01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:42,640
tools so here's a typical

01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,600
typical more typical this is a very

01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,719
small

01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,080
manifest for building an app and then we

01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:52,159
have flat tab

01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:55,440
if you want to oh

01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:56,800
basically anyone can create a flatback

01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,560
ripple

01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,920
we think that's very important however

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,000
in practice everyone

01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,560
basically use user's laptop it's good

01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,400
better for everyone

01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,400
both developers and users

01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,080
i guess my time is up i don't know if

01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,840
there's anyone after this or

01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,679
if we have time to do questions or

01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:19,199
something

01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,199
we absolutely have to

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,639
like a gap in comparison to snap and

01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:53,679
traditional method

01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:53,679
methods such as deb rpm etc

01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,840
yeah so obviously there is you know

01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,360
completely non-desktop things like

01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,080
running a

01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,199
a web server or something and and and in

01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:08,239
that case i

01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:10,480
think we're just not interested in

01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:11,679
in competing with that because the

01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,760
things that

01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,520
flatback does well which is integration

01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,360
with a desktop

01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,880
is it's not interesting for that those

01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,080
kinds of apps and and

01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,400
on the other hand if you look at the

01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,960
tools that that are available for

01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,520
for that kind of thing which is you know

01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,159
docker

01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,679
kubernetes all these clustering things

01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:31,280
the things they do

01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,600
is not something that flat pack does

01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,679
like port forwarding or

01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,199
complicated network setups and automatic

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,239
scaling and all that

01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:42,800
we are not interested in doing that so

01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,679
we don't have we don't want to compete

01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,600
with that

01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,960
i mean i guess there is an overlap where

01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:51,040
you have a

01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:52,800
desktop thing that kind of runs as a

01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,080
server that serves in the background

01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:58,400
and and there's also the command line

01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,239
thing where you know some command lines

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,440
are just

01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:05,760
server style things and some are

01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,199
more like midnight commander which is

01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,960
more like an app but it runs

01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:14,400
in in the command line so

01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,400
there is this these corner cases where

01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,440
it is possible to run command line apps

01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,560
in flat pack

01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,480
we have some interaction

01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,840
uh with them to try to make them more

01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,840
better work better

01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:30,000
we create wrapper file that you can

01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,520
easily alias into your

01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,320
as a command line uh like alias you can

01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,480
easily run them but

01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:40,239
we do have some we have things like a

01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,520
portal to automatically

01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:45,520
add a like a

01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,760
start on logging to the desktop you can

01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:51,360
start up a background thing

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,040
i think we do have portal that lets you

01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,760
add that but you still have to kind of

01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:59,120
launch your app once and then you can

01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,040
it can ask the desktop to have an

01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:04,400
autostart file

01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:08,320
could we do better than that possibly

01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:11,840
is it interesting it's certainly not

01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:13,920
in the focus of what we're working on

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,920
but

01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:21,840
it might be there might be things we

01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,840
could do better

01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:28,560
all right well it looks like

01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,679
that oh we do have a second question

01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,400
great okay

01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,520
second question now that flat pack 1.0

01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,760
is out

01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,360
and is becoming more stable what's the

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,560
next big feature

01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,679
or is it more around tools around around

01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,679
it such as portals

01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:48,159
yeah i mean so actually the next version

01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,000
is going to be kind of a large change

01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:53,199
but it's mostly in internals

01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,440
uh for scaling

01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,400
uh better on the network because flat

01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:00,000
hub is reaching

01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:02,639
like a thousand apps and it's gonna be

01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,960
gonna be important to to keep be able to

01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:08,000
keep going as the size goes up

01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,159
so so so the next release will have kind

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,560
of a large internal changes but it might

01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:16,800
not necessarily be a very

01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:19,840
visible change um

01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,280
that being said i guess we have some

01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,440
new features that are interesting to

01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:26,080
look at uh

01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,040
more better support for different types

01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,719
of of uh

01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:33,199
network name spacing like

01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,960
right now network access is an all or

01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:38,159
nothing thing we're looking at maybe

01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,880
using some kind of uh nat like filtering

01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:42,960
or something and and there there

01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:46,000
certainly is a lot more work in the

01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:49,920
portals side of things

01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,320
and even like pipe wire and things in

01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,120
the

01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:56,480
in the in the larger ecosystem rather

01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,480
than flat pack itself i think

01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:02,080
as you know we get most features and and

01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:05,040
and things

01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:07,520
basically just work i i expect the

01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,480
development speed of flat pack itself

01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,480
kind of slows down

01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:17,920
and you know the things around it

01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,000
such as you know actually working on the

01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:27,600
runtimes

01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:30,719
and the portals and all that stuff

01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:32,480
one one thing that that i think kind of

01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:35,120
ties back to the previous one is

01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:37,120
the previous talk is that if we have

01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:40,159
some initial work

01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:43,120
on the technology for for

01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:44,239
authentication and payments of flat

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,600
packs and i think it would be

01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:49,520
interesting

01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:50,400
to have you know way to pay for flat

01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,120
packs

01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,480
but that's a mostly done on the

01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,360
technical side and

01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,880
all that has to be done is on there

01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,480
actually doing it and there's a lot of

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,600
legal issues and

01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:05,679
you know actually having payments

01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,639
working and all that

01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:11,840
but that that i think it's is something

01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:15,600
really important to get done but

01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,880
again it's not necessarily in flatback

01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:23,840
itself it's more

01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:23,840
the stuff around it

01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:29,920
awesome well thank you very much alex

01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:33,040
for

01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,920
your talk and we are leading into

01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,679
to a break but please feel free to chat

01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,239
in the public chat here

01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:42,080
or head over to the hallway track to

01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:45,440
continue talking more

01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:48,560
face-to-face um in the meantime

01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:51,840
we will be taking a five minute

01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:54,320
break and we will be back

01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:56,159
with brickless battery saving with

01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,760
umbrutu touch

01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:03,120
presented by dalton thank you again alex

01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,280
for presenting about flat pack

01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,320
and i hope you get to enjoy the rest of

01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:10,000
the

like uh we have great conversations

01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:58,400
happening in the public chat

01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,520
which is very interesting and so for the

01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,719
next talk we

01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,760
are going to be having um

01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:07,679
delton so if i have not pronounced your

01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:09,199
name correctly

01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:12,880
he's going to be talking to us about

01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:16,000
brickless battery 7 with ubuntu touch

01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:20,800
and i hope um you all enjoy it um

01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,880
over to you dalton thank you regina

01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:25,360
hi everyone uh welcome to brickless

01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,840
battery saving with ubuntu touch

01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,360
uh this is a talk that's all about the

01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,639
tools that we can use

01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,719
to make linux on mobile devices just as

01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:38,000
popular and just as useful

01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:40,560
as android and ios that's a pretty big

01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,560
one i know

01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,080
i'll be talking about what ubuntu touch

01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,280
does to save battery

01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:49,679
and what well everyone else being

01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,760
android and ios does now

01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:54,000
hi there i'm dalton i'm the development

01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,280
manager for ubuntu touch at the eb ports

01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,960
foundation

01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,120
ubuntu touch is the open source

01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,719
replacement to android or ios

01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,840
if you're interested you want to learn

01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,040
more you can head over to

01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:08,239
devices.ubuntu.touch

01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:10,800
see if it works on your device uh you

01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:12,480
can find us on telegram at ubports

01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,440
or if you want to join us on matrix you

01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:17,440
can find us at hash ebports

01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,440
colonmatrix.org

01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:23,040
i love researching observing and

01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,840
explaining technology to other people

01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:27,440
i love um going back in history and

01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,239
seeing why we do things the way that we

01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,159
do today

01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,760
and i did a lot of that kind of research

01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:35,040
for this talk seeing

01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,840
how people in the past managed to save

01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,000
battery on

01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,600
devices that were much less capable and

01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,920
had much smaller batteries than we have

01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,080
today

01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,760
the talk itself today is all about the

01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:49,119
impossible situations that

01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,760
users ask us to fulfill and

01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:53,440
it's about the eternal eternal truths

01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,840
that we can use to actually fulfill

01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,320
those

01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,320
requests

01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:01,760
basically by fooling our users into

01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,159
thinking that we did the impossible for

01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,920
them

01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:06,000
instead of actually doing the impossible

01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,520
thing that they requested

01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,679
it's a talk about learning from those

01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:14,480
who came before us including

01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:16,719
well blackberry palm oes memo

01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,679
but i'm going to stay really really high

01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,280
level in this

01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,679
in this talk i want to start a

01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:23,840
discussion with other mobile linux

01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:27,199
operating systems that's a mouthful

01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:30,719
about how we can manage to save battery

01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:32,960
for all of our app developers how we can

01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:36,239
help developers do this with us so that

01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:38,480
we actually give users what they want

01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:42,239
this talk will also answer the eternal

01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,840
question why is ubuntu touch so weird um

01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,760
anyone who's used ubuntu touch before

01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:48,400
and tried to run like firefox

01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,679
or telegram desktop on it says well why

01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,000
isn't this work right

01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:54,320
hopefully this will do a bit to explain

01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,320
why

01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,639
at the base of it all the problem that

01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:01,920
we have on mobile devices today

01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:05,199
is that people want impossible things

01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,679
they want a task that they start to run

01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:09,679
until they stop it they want it to run

01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:13,199
always and forever

01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:13,199
for example if i

01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,679
were to install an email app on my phone

01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,080
i would expect that i get email

01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:21,600
until the end of time on my phone and

01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,400
anytime that there is an important

01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,800
message that

01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,600
i receive i want to be notified about

01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,520
that

01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,280
same for telegram if my friends or my

01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,239
enemies are trying to contact me on

01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,320
telegram

01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:34,080
well i want to know about that i want to

01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,400
be told about that

01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:38,239
and if i buy like a smart watch i expect

01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,920
that that thing is always in sync with

01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,119
my phone if i'm getting a notification

01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:45,280
it better be on my watch too

01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,280
time better be up to date um

01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,520
and i expect that to be done without

01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,400
manual intervention

01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,800
um which is kind of the important part

01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,639
here

01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,880
sure we can pull the refresh whatever we

01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:59,600
want but is that

01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,080
that's not too useful this is something

01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,480
that we

01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,000
usually refer to as always on or

01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:06,159
constant connectivity

01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,080
where our applications are always

01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:11,520
available always connected

01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:14,800
um and always up to date

01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:17,199
the problem is that we also want

01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,800
to get long battery life while having

01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:21,280
all these constantly connected things

01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:23,920
going on

01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:26,560
and there's a little problem called the

01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:30,719
laws of physics

01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:34,000
every task that we do on a cpu or a gpu

01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:37,280
or a network some network hardware takes

01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,639
energy and we have limited energy

01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,080
available from the batteries of our

01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,199
devices

01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:45,920
so if we just run tasks always

01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:47,119
forever we don't actually end up getting

01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,239
good battery life

01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,239
and that's a problem that we have on

01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:52,000
linux smartphones today you can either

01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:55,280
choose like with the pine phone

01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:57,119
to have a useful device that receives

01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,719
notifications from more than just

01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:02,719
sms and phone calls

01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,960
or you can have a device that lasts

01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:07,360
longer than 12 hours on a charge

01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:09,440
and that's not a very good compromise to

01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,960
make

01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,080
that's the old way of compromising

01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,239
things that's how we've been doing

01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,280
things since 1986 on the ibm pc

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:17,760
convertible

01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:20,000
in the pc space yes i said that i

01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:21,440
researched back really far for this

01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,159
might be worth a blog post what i've

01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:26,800
learned sometime

01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:27,440
either your laptop is running tasks it

01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,760
is

01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:31,119
getting your telegram messages from your

01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,400
friends and enemies it is

01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:37,199
receiving uh email or you

01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:38,080
shut the lid and you're not receiving

01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:41,920
anything anymore

01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:43,679
the laptop is effectively off

01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,960
and that's a problem that we have

01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,960
persisted on the smartphone

01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,040
um we need to get around that and we can

01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,679
start

01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,880
we can try to do that by just saying

01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,119
well

01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,119
let's just not compromise let's just let

01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:00,239
apps do whatever they want whenever they

01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:02,800
want

01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,520
and in linux we have this really great

01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,199
thing called

01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,880
runtime power management or

01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:10,239
opportunistic idle

01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:14,000
which means whenever your device

01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:16,320
isn't doing something actively it can

01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,119
idle everything that doesn't need to be

01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,880
running

01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,560
isn't running and you save energy that

01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,239
way

01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,080
but we end up with some problems when we

01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:27,360
try that we don't hit

01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:30,960
idle often enough for example on my dell

01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:34,800
xps 13 9370 which is the laptop

01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,960
i use every day if i were to

01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,960
close all my applications all my next

01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,760
cloud stuff and just leave wi-fi on

01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,960
and leave it connected it receives 65

01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:47,280
hours of battery life

01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:50,719
with screen off that drops about half

01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:54,159
once i open telegram and discord irc

01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:56,800
cloud element and thunderbird

01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:58,000
and i only get 26 hours of battery life

01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,840
with the screen off

01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,520
and never turning on i never received a

01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:05,920
notification during this time

01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:08,400
because i'm a sad lonely person um

01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:09,360
but that battery life dropped by half so

01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,480
if we could say

01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:14,560
get one day of battery life on a phone

01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,520
once we run all those apps and actually

01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:20,159
get notifications like we expect

01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,239
on a phone we're only going to get 12

01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:24,400
hours of battery life

01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:25,920
and on the pine phone we're only able to

01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:29,280
do 12 hours of battery life

01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,400
without aggressive power management

01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,320
which is something i'll talk about a

01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,400
little bit

01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:36,080
and then if you do something wild and

01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:40,239
crazy like open up a chrome

01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:41,440
tab with cnn.com in it no ad block

01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:43,360
and just leave that running in the

01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,639
background you get 9 hours of battery

01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:48,159
life

01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:50,480
at least on this xps this

01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,360
isn't a very good experience at all that

01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:54,960
is a really

01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:58,960
short uh for something that is suspended

01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,960
or the screen isn't on

01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,280
and that brings us to some eternal

01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,400
truths about saving power

01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:09,600
on computers idling is

01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,320
good when we're idle we use less power

01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,040
because we're

01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,920
opportunistically turning off pieces of

01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:19,520
the system that we don't need

01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:21,760
but idle means idle

01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,880
it means that absolutely nothing can be

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,880
happening in the background

01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,520
and that can be a problem for our

01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:32,560
current applications they don't know

01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,880
when to stop processing so that

01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,679
this is the system can actually be idle

01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,679
easy for me to say

01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,280
another eternal truth to power

01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:41,920
management is that it takes more energy

01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:46,480
to go from

01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:50,239
idle to running than it takes to go from

01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:52,719
running to rather busy

01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:54,239
going from zero percent cpu usage to one

01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:56,480
percent cpu usage

01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:58,080
is a higher jump than going from one

01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:01,679
percent cpu usage to

01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:03,119
say 25 or 50 percent in terms of

01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,080
the amount of energy that you're burning

01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:06,080
off into the atmosphere

01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,400
and therefore it's better to idle less

01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,639
but for longer periods

01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,679
than it is to idle more for shorter

01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,360
periods

01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,920
when we look at the power usage of our

01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:19,520
devices or the cpu usage even

01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,280
we want it to look more like the graph

01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,400
that i have at the bottom of the slide

01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:27,760
where there are huge valleys and

01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:31,520
huge peaks rather than a lot of

01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,400
hilly landscapes because as you can see

01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,560
in that slide

01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,159
this is actually the power usage of my

01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,360
laptop

01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:42,639
when it's in idle there's a huge peak

01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:46,159
from going from no cpu usage to

01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:49,760
some cpu usage that can amount to a

01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:49,760
significant amount of battery power used

01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,840
the problem that we have is we assumed

01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,480
that users

01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,239
actually want constant connectivity they

01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,119
want their tasks and their applications

01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:02,639
to be running

01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:04,800
always and forever but

01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:06,400
there is an easier solution that

01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,400
actually is much harder to pull off in

01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,320
practice

01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,159
i always want my applications to be up

01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,960
to date isn't the same as

01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:17,280
i want my application to be running all

01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:20,480
the time

01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:21,840
it means i want it to fool me into

01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,960
thinking that my applications are

01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,199
running all the time

01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,080
it just needs to be a good enough

01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,199
illusion

01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,639
of constant connectivity not

01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:33,280
actually constantly connected

01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:33,280
applications

01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:38,239
so then we need to compromise the other

01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:41,440
way when we talk about

01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:41,920
saving power on mobile devices you might

01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,080
think

01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,960
well we need to tell applications okay

01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,040
so

01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,400
discord you're running right now element

01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,920
is also running right now

01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:51,679
and it's going to check for its messages

01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,600
every five minutes or so

01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:55,360
so you should check for your messages

01:43:53,600 --> 01:44:00,320
when it checks for messages

01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:02,800
that way we have longer values of idle

01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:04,880
the problem is applications don't need

01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:07,280
to care about other applications running

01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,239
on the system that's not fair to an app

01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:10,400
developer

01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:13,520
that just makes them implement a lot of

01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,520
stuff they don't care about

01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,400
luna asks could you just update fast

01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:23,679
when the app starts to be active

01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:25,280
no not really because you want

01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:27,280
applications to be sending you

01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,800
notifications like i just got on my

01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,320
phone now

01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,920
when people message you even if it's

01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:34,880
just sitting on a desk and appears to be

01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,960
doing nothing

01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,080
so we actually end up doing in practice

01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,239
then is

01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:41,679
suspending apps whenever they aren't in

01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:44,239
use

01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,360
whenever an app is focused it is not

01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,639
paused and it knows

01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:50,639
i can process whatever i want right now

01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,760
and then when an app isn't focused we

01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,600
pause it

01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:55,360
and does that mean that there's just no

01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:56,960
worries well

01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:58,480
not exactly because there are things

01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,239
that you want to do in the background

01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,000
you want to check for emails you want to

01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:05,280
update checklists and you want

01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:08,159
to notify the user if anything

01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:08,159
exceptional happens

01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:11,679
we'll talk about that just a moment but

01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,239
it's worth noting

01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:16,159
that if we suspend applications in idle

01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:17,679
we go to a state where we know

01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:19,679
when the system is doing something and

01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,320
when it isn't it's a system managed

01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,000
state

01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,440
and that allows us to do aggressive

01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,600
power management like

01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,040
manually shutting off the phone or

01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,560
putting it in to suspend

01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:31,679
and waking up a little bit later when

01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,199
apps requested to wake up

01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,040
that's how we get good battery life on

01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:36,800
the pine phone is by

01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,159
not actually having it in idle but

01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,679
having it in suspend

01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:44,400
and just fooling you into thinking it's

01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:47,600
only idling

01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,840
now this will make people upset

01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,719
because they want to run the same apps

01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,199
that they run

01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,520
today on their phone they're going to

01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:58,239
say i wanted real linux on my phone not

01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,560
this thing that you're giving me trust

01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:01,600
me

01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,880
i hear this every other day the thing is

01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,360
they aren't really saying

01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,560
i want the exact same apps that i have

01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:08,320
on my laptop

01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,560
they're saying i want the same

01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,760
experience from these apps that i have

01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,000
on my laptop

01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,639
i want telegram to run and i want it to

01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,159
tell me when i have new messages

01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:20,480
that doesn't necessarily mean that they

01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:21,119
want the same telegram desktop app on

01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:23,119
their phone

01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:24,719
and their laptop it'd be cool if they

01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:27,760
did though

01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:30,159
if the telegram desktop app was able to

01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,639
work when it was suspended in the

01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,639
background

01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:36,880
we start giving applications back the

01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,480
ability to run in the background

01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:42,080
step by step and that allows them to

01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,080
create the illusion of constant

01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:46,080
connectivity whereas

01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,600
well devices are kind of useless when

01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,199
everything is suspended whenever the

01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,480
screen is off

01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:53,679
we start giving apps back the

01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,440
opportunity to run in the background

01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,719
and this is something that we schedule

01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:58,880
as a system

01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:59,920
rather than as a bunch of apps trying

01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:03,679
loosely to

01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:06,480
work together the problem is that

01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:07,360
whenever we make a more convenient

01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:09,360
option

01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:12,960
a more flexible way for an app to run in

01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:16,080
the background it becomes

01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,440
less efficient the more that app

01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,360
developers are able to dictate

01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:21,360
exactly when their app runs in the

01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:23,440
background the less battery we have

01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:24,480
so that's a trade-off that we need to be

01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,600
um

01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,719
aware of also the more clever we need to

01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:32,480
make our

01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,440
um illusion the more that we suspend in

01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:37,600
the background

01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:39,520
the better battery life we get but

01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:42,080
it's harder to implement those clever

01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:42,080
solutions

01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:47,119
we then go so we're walking back the

01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,639
restrictions that we placed on app

01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:50,960
developers

01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,320
and we're walking them back in phases

01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,520
first off we make the required

01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,679
background services

01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:57,040
the things that basically everyone wants

01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,280
from their smartphone

01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:01,760
we make dedicated services to provide

01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:05,440
those applications

01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:08,000
next we create push services which allow

01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:11,360
application servers to tell the device

01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,040
when they have data to send

01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,639
from there we go on and create

01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:16,880
background extensions allowing

01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,480
applications that were in the foreground

01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,560
to run in the background for a short

01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:22,400
period of time

01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,400
we move on from there into maintenance

01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,560
tasks for things like

01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,400
refreshing your rss feeds in the

01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,480
background when you don't have a server

01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:33,760
component that can tell you

01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:35,920
when there's something new to see

01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,360
and finally we end off by implementing

01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,239
the easy button solution

01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,280
and that is uh actual real demons like

01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:44,639
we have

01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:46,639
on current systems today

01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:48,159
i would recommend implementing in this

01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,880
order um

01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:52,480
and well ubuntu touch is currently on

01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,159
the path we have the required background

01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,920
services and the push services

01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:57,600
that allow us to do this kind of thing

01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,520
and to a point kind of have the

01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:02,400
background extensions

01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,159
but this is just as much a proposal for

01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,960
how ubuntu touch is going to continue

01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:07,360
developing

01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,239
so that our app developers get the

01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,560
expectation

01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,920
their expectations met and their users

01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,520
expectations met

01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,239
just as much as it's a recommendation

01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,199
for how everyone should do this

01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:21,199
basically what i'm saying is uh we're

01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:22,960
probably going to do things this way

01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:26,239
whether people join us or not but we

01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,239
would love to have you join us

01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:31,520
um let's see yeah we start off by

01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,199
implementing the required background

01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:36,560
services the things that people will

01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:39,760
want the absolute most

01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,800
and we do this by well seeing what users

01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,119
use on their device

01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:45,520
most often we target the things that

01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:47,280
they do most often on their device

01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,679
and why they want their apps to run in

01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:52,159
the background

01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,719
the first one of those is media playback

01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:56,400
people want to play audio or video even

01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:58,080
when the screen is off on their device

01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:01,520
or the application playing the audio or

01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,520
video isn't in the foreground

01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:07,440
people want to upload and download files

01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:09,280
well apps want to do it for things like

01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,440
creating a social media post

01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,800
they want to upload files even when they

01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,159
aren't in the foreground because that

01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,920
could be a long running task

01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:18,560
the user could get bored and switch away

01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,560
while they do it

01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,360
we want to provide location updates to

01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,119
applications this is something that

01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,800
ubuntu touch doesn't do yet the other

01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:31,199
two are things that it does

01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:34,880
but if an application is using um

01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:36,560
apple uh locate location services

01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,639
it wants to be updated when it's in the

01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,320
background when the user moves

01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,320
for example if you have a run tracking

01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,679
application the user might be switching

01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,239
applications and running while browsing

01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,599
the web

01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:47,760
or they might have turned their phone

01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:51,679
off which is more likely

01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,960
and the app should continue receiving

01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:56,000
location updates

01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:57,520
when that occurs and then finally uh

01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,080
people want to create alarm clocks so

01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:02,639
their device wakes up and wakes them up

01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:07,679
uh when they request it excuse me for

01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:10,880
just a moment

01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,880
oh much better

01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,880
those are our required background

01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:16,400
services and once we have those in place

01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:19,119
um we're able to provide the experience

01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:22,320
of an iphone one in 2007.

01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:26,000
well actually the iphone 3g in 2008 when

01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:29,040
they opened up the app store developers

01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,840
from there we move on to what ios 3

01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:33,280
added

01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:35,920
and the iphone 3gs debuted with in 2009

01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:36,560
we're only 11 years behind now and we

01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,840
create

01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:41,840
push services push services flip the

01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,599
script on client devices

01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,960
whereas usually when you're running

01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:47,520
telegram or discord

01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,159
on your devices today they asked the

01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,840
server

01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:51,520
hey do you have content for me do you

01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,560
have content for me do you have content

01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,679
for me

01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,639
we instead make the server tell the

01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,920
client device

01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,719
i have content for you this is much more

01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,880
efficient because

01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:04,000
the server already knows that it has

01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,080
content available

01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,520
why doesn't it just make the client

01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,040
aware of that instead of the client

01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,560
needing to check in

01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:13,520
even though there might not be new

01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,520
content on the server

01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,360
it's kind of like a publisher or a

01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,080
publish and subscribe model

01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:21,119
except instead of polling like you would

01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,440
do an rss

01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:25,280
you get pushed the information that

01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:27,040
there's new data available

01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,800
we make the server tell the app i have

01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,520
data for you

01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,239
this can enable a lot of experiences in

01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,320
fact

01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:35,280
implementing a push service which is

01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,199
done by

01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:39,119
creating a client service on the device

01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:42,480
which holds a connection

01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:44,639
a single usually tcp connection

01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,920
to a server somewhere that is the push

01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,560
service

01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:52,560
and then app servers tell the push

01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:54,080
service i have content for this device

01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,760
the push service tells the device

01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,560
there's content for you and the device

01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,639
can then

01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,960
pull the content from the application

01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,960
server

01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:06,480
implementing these isn't easy but it

01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,119
allows us to do things like

01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:10,239
well get notification cards even when a

01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:13,679
device is

01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:15,920
seemingly asleep and off it allows us to

01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:17,040
grab information like if you had a news

01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:20,400
reader app

01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:24,400
like an rss feed app and it had a server

01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:26,320
component you could have the server

01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,159
tell the client there's content for you

01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:29,599
and then as soon as the user opens the

01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:31,760
application

01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:34,639
their news is available for them they

01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,719
don't need to wait for it to refresh

01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:39,280
so not only does this enable being able

01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:42,239
to do things and suspend it also enables

01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:45,679
apps to continue being refreshed even

01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:45,679
though they appear not to be running

01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,880
of course there are some cons to this

01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:52,639
model of course

01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,239
first off the actual um

01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,679
the actual push service itself is kind

01:53:54,239 --> 01:53:58,000
of hard to implement

01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:59,199
ubi ports already has a push service for

01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,199
ubuntu touch

01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:06,000
but it's based off of um some test code

01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:07,599
from canonical when they were developing

01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,639
ubuntu touch

01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:14,400
and it's not the huge big scalable

01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:14,400
solution that canonical originally had

01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:19,840
but it's also centralized whereas

01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,719
there are new technologies coming up

01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:23,520
like web

01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:24,560
push which enable decentralized push

01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,599
services

01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:30,639
where your client subscribes to

01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,639
your server and it tells

01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:35,920
app servers hey you should send

01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,840
notification content to my server

01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,320
whereas with a centralized system it's

01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,400
just

01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,679
there is one server everyone subscribes

01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,760
to that and if you don't like it

01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:48,800
well you can go away that's not ideal

01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,239
especially for use cases where

01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,080
maybe you don't have internet access

01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:53,840
maybe you're a company that is

01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:57,199
air-gapped on your network but you still

01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:57,199
want to provide these solutions

01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:03,440
i think web push is the way to go for

01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:06,400
this it is a w3c

01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:07,760
i think standard that is in progress and

01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,400
it's already implemented for

01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,360
firefox so we can take some of that

01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:14,639
implementation

01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:16,159
and reuse it of course with ubuntu touch

01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,159
we already have a solution for this

01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,760
so that's future stuff where we're going

01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:22,320
to be replacing that but

01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,080
i do plan on it happening because ubuntu

01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:28,880
push while it's wonderful

01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:28,880
um it's nearing its time

01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:34,400
also your app servers need to be

01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,360
centralized in this model you can't have

01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,840
apps that are

01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:39,679
only available on the client and have no

01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:41,440
server component

01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,719
i think this might be okay i think that

01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:45,360
it might be okay for

01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,599
open source projects to start having

01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:51,040
hosted services components that you can

01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:53,199
choose to run yourself that talk to

01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:54,719
maybe an applications or a push server

01:55:53,199 --> 01:56:00,320
that you run yourself or maybe

01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:03,119
one that someone else runs

01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:04,320
i think it wouldn't be bad for open

01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:06,719
source projects

01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:08,719
to run hosted components like that

01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:12,080
especially if we want to talk about

01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:14,560
open source projects maybe getting

01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:15,679
services revenue we just talked a little

01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,599
bit ago about

01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:19,280
increasing revenue to open source

01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,840
projects that could be a possible way is

01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:23,199
by

01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:26,960
having them be services organizations

01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:29,119
that provide

01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,520
push services for your application but

01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:35,040
uh that's getting way off i'm sorry

01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,920
i need to move on at this point we can

01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,679
enable

01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:41,520
most if not well we can enable most

01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,280
use cases on mobile we can enable things

01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,480
like rss readers with services

01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:46,800
components we can enable

01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,560
voice over ip applications by having the

01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,480
voice over ip server tell us

01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:51,679
there's a call in coming and we can

01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:54,840
enable just

01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:56,480
getting notifications from telegram and

01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,719
stuff

01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,760
but there are some use cases where none

01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:03,040
of those

01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:05,920
really work so we move on

01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:07,199
to background tasks actually allowing

01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,040
application code

01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:10,239
to run in the background because up to

01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:12,560
this point we've usually

01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:13,440
not been running application code we've

01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,400
been running

01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,440
centralized daemon code on the device

01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:20,400
that then

01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:22,480
chooses to tell applications specific

01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:24,639
updates

01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,040
with background tasks we split common

01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,080
work that applications want to do in the

01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,440
background

01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:31,199
and we know that they want to do this

01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:34,480
because they do it in

01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:38,000
linux desktop applications and we allow

01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:39,920
applications to do this

01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,840
split it into we've split this kind of

01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,840
work into three main categories

01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,280
work that the user requested would

01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,800
happen right now

01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,880
as your application is transitioning to

01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:50,239
the background and then

01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:52,560
work that applications would want to

01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:55,360
happen sometime in the future

01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,000
it doesn't really matter and finally

01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,080
work that

01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,440
applications would want to have done at

01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:03,360
an exact time in the future

01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,360
it's worth noting as we go down that

01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,400
list the more flexible options

01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:10,400
give you worse battery life so if we're

01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:13,360
giving app developers more control over

01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,800
exactly when they run their tasks

01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,560
we need to be really careful about

01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,000
scheduling those otherwise we ruin

01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:19,599
battery life for the user

01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,719
and that's bad for both app developers

01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,480
because their users complain that

01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,159
they're getting bad battery life

01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:25,840
after they installed their app that's

01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,040
not fair and

01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,719
well it's bad for the system because

01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:30,719
they say the system has bad battery life

01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:35,679
so as much as we can get applications to

01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:37,040
use the services i'm talking about first

01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:39,119
rather than the ones i'm talking about

01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,800
last the better

01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:42,800
we start with background tasks that we

01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,920
want to happen now

01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,880
these are things like rendering a 3d

01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,480
scene in blender

01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,480
you kick off a render and then you get

01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:52,800
bored so you switch off your phone

01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:56,000
or you head over to the web browser and

01:58:52,800 --> 01:59:00,960
watch some funny cat videos

01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:03,119
or compiling software visual studio code

01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,639
or transcoding video before you upload

01:59:03,119 --> 01:59:06,000
it to chat service because someone just

01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,400
took a mean video of you and they want

01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,400
to show you

01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,159
on ios and android this is fully

01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,360
possible they both have this implemented

01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:15,119
and of course they have everything i

01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,880
talked about before implemented

01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:19,440
they give you a few minutes after you're

01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:21,040
in the foreground to finish your work

01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:23,199
and if you don't aren't able to finish

01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,520
your work in that time don't sweat it

01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:26,960
pause your work and then notify the user

01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,080
that you ran out of time and they need

01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:31,199
to come back to your app

01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:33,280
to resume android makes things a little

01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:35,119
bit more flexible because you can just

01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,320
notify the user that you are continuing

01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:39,040
to use more time

01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:40,480
whereas on ios you need to say please

01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,760
come back we didn't finish what you

01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:43,280
asked us to do

01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,760
just a bit of a difference of opinion

01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,520
between the two platforms there

01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,440
we move on to background tasks that you

01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:52,239
want to happen some

01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,599
nebulous time in the future uh these are

01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:54,320
really inflexible because basically

01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:57,440
you're telling

01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:59,119
mr god king system please do this thing

01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:02,400
i am requesting you do

01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:02,400
at some point in the future

02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:07,199
and then the system chooses to schedule

02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:08,960
that at some point that is useful to it

02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:10,639
to minimize wakeups to ensure that it's

02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,400
safe to use the data connection to make

02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,840
sure the user isn't present so that we

02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,880
don't ruin their experience of their

02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,880
foreground applications

02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:20,800
you would use this for things like

02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,679
cleaning up your database or

02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:25,520
refreshing app content like if you have

02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:26,239
an rss reader that is local on the

02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,599
device

02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:31,360
and you need to go out and check all

02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:34,000
these rss feeds you might use

02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:34,880
a task like this to do that because it

02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,639
doesn't

02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:38,960
really matter that the user gets their

02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,239
content immediately when it happens

02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,679
if they haven't requested push

02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:44,159
notifications it just matters that you

02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:45,840
don't take a long time to refresh

02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:48,080
when it's time for the user to open your

02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:52,000
app

02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:54,000
a good scheduler lets you do things like

02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,760
i only want these tasks to run when the

02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:59,920
device is on bat or on

02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:01,280
charging ios allows you to do this with

02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,199
background tasks

02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:05,040
and you have absolutely no control over

02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:07,040
when ios does these tasks for you

02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:09,360
you basically say i want to run this

02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:12,719
machine learning algorithm

02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:15,760
and the system says okay and it never

02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:17,280
says anything again until it's done

02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,360
android allows you a little bit more

02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:22,800
flexibility again with work manager

02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,239
and you can constrain your tasks to run

02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:28,080
when you're on battery when you're on

02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:28,080
wi-fi you have a lot of options there

02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:31,679
and then finally you have background

02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:32,800
tasks that you want to happen at an

02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,480
exact time later

02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:36,000
these are the most flexible but they

02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:39,199
give poor battery life

02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,760
you say every 15 minutes

02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:43,440
i would like to refresh email so that i

02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:44,080
can notify the user when they have new

02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,840
email

02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,440
and i don't have a server that i can use

02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:50,159
to notify the user when they have new

02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:52,320
email via push service

02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:53,520
on ios you can do this only if you are

02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,760
apple

02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,880
you have no other options but on android

02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,960
you have some options

02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,960
you can use work manager schedule tasks

02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:03,040
to get an approximate

02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,239
task completed this would be best for

02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:06,400
email because it's not

02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:08,880
essential that the user gets their email

02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:12,880
every five minutes exactly

02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,719
instead we can allow the system to um

02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,159
schedule tasks as they work for example

02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,119
if you schedule something at

02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:20,880
101 you schedule something at 102 and

02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:22,480
you schedule something at 103

02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,320
well the system can just say well why

02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:27,040
don't we run all those things at 103 to

02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:27,040
save more power

02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:30,639
android has two options for this work

02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,040
manager schedule tasks are approximate

02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:35,440
and alarm manager you would use if you

02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:38,560
want an exact task in the future

02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:40,239
although with android 8 and up there's

02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,159
doze mode which actually makes your

02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:42,719
exact tasks run at some point in the

02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:45,040
future

02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:48,400
unless you say no really really this

02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:49,679
needs to happen at an exact time

02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:52,000
again these are only examples of

02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:53,920
implementation not exactly

02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,840
we don't need to file them exactly but

02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:57,280
given that both ios and android have 12

02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,560
years of experience on this i think we

02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:02,400
should take heed when

02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,000
literally everything else we have

02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:06,480
provided has failed

02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,040
we give applications the opportunity to

02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:10,159
make

02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:12,400
demons these are

02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:13,440
services that run all the time in the

02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,599
background

02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:17,280
these are really unsafe because they

02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,480
make it impossible for us to do

02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:21,599
aggressive power management

02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:21,599
because we might end up

02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:26,239
conflicting with what the app wants to

02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:28,320
do in the background

02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:30,080
so basically you just have to hope that

02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:32,719
the application developer

02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:35,520
made safe backgrounds or made a safe

02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:35,520
background service

02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,280
we have to look at the most common

02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:40,880
reasons why people would use these

02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:43,040
why developers would create apps with

02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:46,320
these and try to solve them

02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:48,639
for example it might be an issue of

02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:49,520
not being able to launch an app at the

02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:51,280
right time

02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:54,239
to respond to events that happen on the

02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:56,960
device for example if your next cloud

02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:59,360
or bacula and you want to back up a

02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,079
user's content exactly when they take

02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,520
pictures

02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:04,880
or modify stuff well then we might want

02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,119
a better content model

02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,400
where a saved file is able to notify

02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:10,320
multiple applications

02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:13,840
that there's new content and launch them

02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,599
so they don't need to run all the time

02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:17,199
however there will be some cases where

02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:20,400
there's just nothing we can do

02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:24,159
like decentralized and latency sensitive

02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:26,880
um applications like voiceover i p

02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:28,159
where you have 30 seconds to understand

02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:31,280
that there's a call coming in

02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:33,920
or you've missed it and you've failed

02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,599
um voiceover ip is really about the only

02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:38,159
thing i think of

02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:39,599
for these kinds of apps but there of our

02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:45,760
there are of course

02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:47,679
more because i am small brain sometimes

02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:48,960
and of course finally there are the

02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:52,320
applications that will

02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,880
expect incoming connections like an ssh

02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:56,079
server

02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:58,000
or a sync thing an instance

02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:59,440
where you can't go to sleep anytime

02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,560
because at any point

02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:06,079
anyone from anywhere could say i would

02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:08,960
like you to respond to me now

02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:10,719
and basically then we have to say well

02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,639
if your phone is a server it gets

02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:14,320
battery life like a server

02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,440
like 30 seconds because it has backup

02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:17,440
battery for the hard drives

02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:21,840
and um

02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,639
apologies lapse of laps of judgment

02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:29,199
there

02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:30,480
so to recap people want their computers

02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:32,639
to run their tasks

02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:34,239
forever but they also want good battery

02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:38,480
life and these two things

02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:40,239
are in constant conflict with each other

02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:42,159
so we need to think about some of the

02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:44,639
eternal truths of power management

02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:46,320
if we're idle we can say power but idle

02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:47,440
means there is absolutely nothing

02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:51,440
happening in the background

02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:54,960
ever and the state to go

02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:57,599
from idle to running uses more energy

02:05:54,960 --> 02:06:00,000
than going from running to busy so the

02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,199
more tasks we can schedule at once

02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,480
the better applications have trouble

02:06:03,199 --> 02:06:06,800
making that kind of thing happen

02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:08,480
themselves and we don't need

02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:12,000
to make services that like tell

02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:14,400
applications everyone else is running so

02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,280
we start by suspending them absolutely

02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:17,760
and then

02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:19,119
we help them to create the illusion of

02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:21,040
constant connectivity

02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:22,320
rather than genuine constant

02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:24,159
connectivity

02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,920
we start by suspending all applications

02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:27,119
and then we give app developers the

02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,639
tools they need

02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:30,639
to run in the background the way that

02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:31,440
their users expect so that they don't

02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,920
get the

02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:34,639
uh i wanted real linux on my mobile

02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,639
phone

02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:38,639
uh snark

02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,239
i want to do this together like i said

02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,079
ubuntu touch is probably going to go

02:06:44,239 --> 02:06:49,360
this way whether people

02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:51,360
um join us or not

02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:52,880
because this is these are the things

02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:56,159
that our users expect and these are the

02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:57,679
things that our app developers expect

02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:59,280
if you want to talk more about this with

02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,800
me you can find me at brickless

02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:03,679
dalton d-u-r dot s-t or go to dalton d-r

02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:06,000
dot s-t

02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:07,599
slash last 2020 where i have all the

02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:11,520
slides from this

02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:12,239
presentation hosted or you can join us

02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:15,360
at uh

02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:17,040
ubports go to forums.ueports.com open up

02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,560
a thread i'd love to talk about what i

02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:21,520
got wrong in this talk

02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:22,880
i'm at uni superbox over there or

02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:26,639
twitter

02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:29,760
at universal superbox on twitter

02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:31,440
again i i'm really passionate about this

02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:33,119
kind of thing about saving battery

02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:34,719
and i think that it doesn't only need to

02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:36,400
be something that happens on desktops i

02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,320
will take questions now

02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,520
or on mobile phones i think this can

02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:43,040
also be something we do

02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,040
on desktops to allow

02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:48,079
more than just our mobile developers and

02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,840
our mobile users to get this kind of

02:07:48,079 --> 02:07:51,930
battery life

02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:51,930
[Music]

02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:57,280
excuse me okay i'll take some questions

02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:00,000
now

02:07:57,280 --> 02:08:02,239
okay thank you so much for your talk um

02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,960
it's actually really interesting and i i

02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:06,560
know

02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:09,199
a lot of people also um had some so much

02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,880
conversation about it on the public chat

02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:13,440
and so we have a couple of questions

02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,920
here um the fosters um is there a

02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:17,440
standard for push notification

02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,840
whether you work for services like

02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:22,960
telegram or google

02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:24,639
so that is one particular problem there

02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:26,239
is kind of a standard for push

02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,760
notifications actually there are

02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:30,000
multiple

02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:31,440
um there is a web standard for push

02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,480
notifications called

02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:38,639
web push which is a app server push

02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:39,679
server and push client specification

02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:41,199
that's probably where we're going to

02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:42,960
look because that's where the most

02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:45,280
developers are going to be

02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,199
putting their effort into but they'll

02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:50,639
still need to implement

02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:54,239
um special cases for applications

02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:58,079
on mobile devices so they'd create

02:08:54,239 --> 02:09:00,480
a web push client for their

02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:01,119
web app they'd also need to make one for

02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:03,840
their

02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:06,000
ubuntu touch app or sorry their linux

02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:10,079
mobile app

02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,840
um um so the second question is what are

02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:15,199
the battery implications

02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:18,880
of having potentially multiple wake-ups

02:09:15,199 --> 02:09:22,239
for multiple decentralized push services

02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:25,040
passes the single wake up with grouped

02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:26,159
notification from a centralized push

02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,239
service

02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:29,679
that is an excellent question it is

02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:30,400
something slightly that you need to

02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:34,960
benchmark

02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:39,440
but generally on desktop linux now

02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:42,079
we have the case of multiple um

02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:43,679
different push services as opposed to

02:09:42,079 --> 02:09:46,560
one single push service

02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:47,840
so like i'm pretty sure though i can't

02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:50,560
look at the code

02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:52,560
discord is doing exactly this they open

02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,920
one websocket connection to their server

02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:55,840
which allows the server to tell the

02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,040
client you have new content instead of

02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,840
actually asking

02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:00,719
do you have new content for me every few

02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,119
seconds

02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:05,040
so the battery implications of having

02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:07,040
multiple decentralized push services

02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:09,040
are the implications of battery that we

02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:12,639
already have when you are running

02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:12,639
applications on a linux desktop

02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,040
okay um so we still have um somebody

02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:18,960
trying to type a new question so let's

02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,599
basically take the third question

02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:23,599
does unborn to touch you see groups for

02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:25,760
managing resources and perhaps

02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:27,520
if not from the order talk at last it

02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,719
seems like it could

02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:34,079
help for management of suspending apps

02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:36,480
ram cpu time and hsc i forgot

02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:38,800
i forgot to mention this in the talk yes

02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:39,599
yes we do we suspend applications via c

02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:41,840
groups

02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:42,800
uh canonical started that with ubuntu

02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:45,679
app launch

02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,480
years before we're talking about doing

02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:48,320
it now

02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,400
but yes ubuntu touch already does that

02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:52,159
so apps can have multiple processes

02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:53,920
and we suspend all of them at once and

02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:56,159
resume all of them at once

02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,400
oh great thank you um so let's take the

02:10:56,159 --> 02:11:00,159
last question um so will this kind of

02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:02,800
power management system be available

02:11:00,159 --> 02:11:05,199
also for laptops and desktop linux

02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:07,520
boy i sure hope so i would love to have

02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:09,760
better idle battery life on my laptop

02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,960
um and basically that's what it comes

02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:12,960
down to is

02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,639
um if we have this kind of thing

02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:16,320
available on desktop we don't

02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,639
necessarily need to suspend

02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:20,079
all applications in the background but

02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:22,800
if they can better say

02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:25,360
i want to run work in the future like i

02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,679
want to update my application code

02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:28,639
at some point in the future when your

02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:31,280
laptop is

02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:33,199
sitting on your desk suspended it can

02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:35,119
receive that new application code like

02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:37,440
discord needing to update sometimes

02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:39,040
you don't need to wait on it or manually

02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,320
restart the application

02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:42,719
your laptop just does it while it's

02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:45,760
sitting on the desk

02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:47,599
oh thank you so much for your talk um i

02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,760
particularly enjoyed it and i'm sure a

02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:51,760
lot of people as well

02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,040

yeah yeah i'm here sorry i'm apparently

02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:17,840
microphone works better when

02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:17,840
it's actually turned on okay great

02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,440
so we can use this a few minutes to

02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,360
continue our conversation on the public

02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:22,960
chat

02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:22,960
which is actually a great conversation

02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,840
really

02:16:06,079 --> 02:16:10,320
hi but um you can go ahead and upload

02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:10,880
your talk we have about two minutes just

02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:14,400
in case

02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:14,400
um you're having an issue

02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:19,840
i think

02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:22,800
hello everyone um so we're going to be

02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:27,359
having the

02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:29,519
next talk in about less than one minute

02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:32,479
we're going to be having the talk on

02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:35,679
flat off of the states of the union by

02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:37,679
bat so we i i

02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:39,599
do not know how to pronounce your name

02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:40,319
properly so that's why i just had to

02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:43,439
shorten it

02:17:40,319 --> 02:17:46,160
i hope that's okay

02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:48,240
that's fine that's fine okay great thank

02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:51,280
you so much and um

02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:54,319
yeah so over to you

02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:57,840
thanks um hello everyone and

02:17:54,319 --> 02:18:00,559
uh i'll actually let me share my camera

02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:01,359
because it turns out it might be better

02:18:00,559 --> 02:18:04,080
to look at me

02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:04,080
as well

02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:13,200
can you see me i hope you can

02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:16,080
um yes yeah so

02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,840
welcome to my living room and good

02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:18,719
morning or good evening it depends on

02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:22,000
whether you live

02:18:18,719 --> 02:18:25,599
um my name is bartomi petrovsky

02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:28,800
and just as regina said um it's

02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:32,000
most likely not pronounceable to you so

02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:35,439
um just feel free to call me

02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
bart like bart simpson um maybe a little

02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:38,880
bit

02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,080
less creepy i hope um yeah so i'm here

02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:43,359
to talk about flat hub

02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,920
um not just about what have we been

02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:46,800
doing

02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,399
for last year but also what flat hub is

02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:51,679
in general

02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:55,200
um yeah few words about

02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:56,719
me um i have been arch linux developer

02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:59,760
for past nine years

02:18:56,719 --> 02:19:01,519
um making and maintaining a lot of

02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,240
packages

02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:05,200
uh probably more that anyone has ever

02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:08,639
wished for

02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:11,920
um professionally i'm working

02:19:08,639 --> 02:19:12,960
on infrastructure in general currently

02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:16,000
on

02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:18,960
on non-foundation

02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,280
but i'm also helping up guys with you

02:19:18,960 --> 02:19:23,439
know

02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,439
summit so so so there is that

02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:31,040
so let's move on um

02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:35,359
so i assume that most of you know what

02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:38,240
flat hub is but let's talk about

02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:38,960
about what flat hub is trying to solve

02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:41,120
so

02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,719
let's imagine for a moment that you just

02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:45,200
wrote an app for linux

02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:47,359
let's say it's something that is not

02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:50,560
probably a game changer

02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:51,359
uh i don't know up for making a perfect

02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:55,760
tiramisu

02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:58,479
or in general cooking recipes and

02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:00,800
you are pretty much sure that everything

02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:03,760
is ready and your app is great

02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:05,520
but then after few months of starting at

02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,880
your github you realize that

02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:11,680
no one is using it so um

02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:14,080
you start looking at various linux

02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:14,720
distributions and how to actually put

02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:18,080
your app

02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:20,399
into repositories so

02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:21,439
you start let's say from fedora because

02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:24,319
that's what

02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:25,600
you are using daily after copy pasting

02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:28,240
this and that from

02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:30,160
random documentation and blog posts you

02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:34,080
arrive at

02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:36,479
this point very very easy

02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:37,200
very easy stuff right everything is

02:20:36,479 --> 02:20:39,840
obvious

02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:41,200
license some are a bunch of weird

02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,000
sections that

02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:46,000
run possibly macros you don't know but

02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,439
because you copy pasted this nobody has

02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,080
time to actually

02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:51,840
understand every line of this because

02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:54,080
lots of this is just

02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:55,280
a common knowledge among package

02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:58,640
maintainers

02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,040
so everything is great your package rpm

02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,920
is

02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,960
ready and some people are able to

02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:05,200
install your app

02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:06,720
but then someone else comes and asks you

02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:09,359
for a debian package

02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:11,280
so you have managed to create a package

02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:15,040
for fedora so what can be

02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:18,720
hard about a debian right well

02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:19,680
this this is just two pages of table of

02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,600
contents for

02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:26,720
debian packaging documentation um so

02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:28,880
after reading all of this and creating a

02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:30,080
debian package and azure notes package

02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:33,120
manjaro package

02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:35,200
and every single other distribution

02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:36,240
you realize that all you have been doing

02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,439
for past

02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:41,280
nine months is making packages so you

02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:43,280
are no longer a developer of

02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,520
software you are now a package

02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:49,680
maintainer and that's what you are doing

02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:51,920
for most of your time so

02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,600
that's probably not what you hoped for

02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:57,280
when you brought your

02:21:53,600 --> 02:22:00,880
small tiramisu up right so

02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:04,479
the goal of flat hub is to be place

02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:08,000
of your application um

02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:11,359
which is accomplished by using flat pack

02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,680
if you have listened to alex stock

02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:15,840
one hour ago i think then you know more

02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:19,040
or less what flatback does so

02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:21,520
i won't be repeating a lot of this

02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:22,160
but the general idea is that flat hub is

02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,120
the

02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:26,240
build and distribution service for your

02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:29,040
application using

02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:29,439
flatback given that someone else takes

02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,439
off

02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:33,040
takes care of all the infrastructure and

02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:36,960
all the knobs that

02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:40,160
you would need to care otherwise

02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:42,479
this is accomplished by very simple json

02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:45,840
or yaml

02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:49,600
so there is very few

02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:52,240
magic commands involved

02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:53,520
so this is a very very basic manifest

02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:58,479
that you could

02:22:53,520 --> 02:23:01,439
use to to build and run a new hello app

02:22:58,479 --> 02:23:04,000
um this is actually using flatback

02:23:01,439 --> 02:23:06,640
builder in the background which is a

02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,359
single command to to do all the fancy

02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:10,800
stuff

02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:14,000
um that flat pack does under the hood

02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:16,399
but the general idea is that it's

02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,280
simple it's json on the ammo just a

02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:19,680
bunch of lines

02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:20,960
without any shell scripts or anything

02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:24,319
else

02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:26,640
and uh yeah so

02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:28,640
when you have this and you actually

02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:32,319
manage to to get this on flat hub

02:23:28,640 --> 02:23:34,479
then or any other using flashback then

02:23:32,319 --> 02:23:35,760
you basically build it once and run

02:23:34,479 --> 02:23:38,880
everywhere because

02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:41,359
slot park is portable tool and

02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:43,760
you can use it on any linux distribution

02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:46,880
whether it's ubuntu fedora or

02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:49,920
chrome os or alpine linux which

02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:51,520
is completely different from usual

02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,240
linux distributions that people are

02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:57,680
using then everything should work just

02:23:54,240 --> 02:24:00,479
fine so

02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,600
uh just so you don't need to actually

02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:04,240
bother with

02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:05,359
building your own linux distribution to

02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:08,080
build your own app

02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:09,359
there is a common runtime called free

02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:13,120
desktop sdk

02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:16,319
which is a base runtime with gtk

02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:19,120
and all the other bass linux

02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:19,760
libraries and on top of this we have

02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,319
gnome

02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:23,200
and kde runtimes which are also

02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:25,359
maintained

02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:26,319
uh separately a separate project

02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:29,840
although

02:24:26,319 --> 02:24:30,720
as usually some people are helping out

02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:33,439
everywhere

02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:35,120
which is absolutely great this way we

02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:37,280
can ensure that

02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:38,160
first of all you as a app maintainer

02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:41,520
don't need to

02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:44,560
think about whatever runtime is

02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,479
and someone else is handling security

02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:47,600
updates and bug fixes and everything

02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:50,160
else

02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:51,359
however as an app maintainer you are not

02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:53,200
limited to just

02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:55,120
what runtimes provides but you can also

02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:58,000
bundle specific dependencies that

02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:59,280
only your app needs so you don't need to

02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,080
care about

02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:03,120
openssl but if your application needs to

02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:10,960
leave tiramisu

02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:13,120
then you are good to go to bundle this

02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:14,240
yeah and the most important part about

02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,359
flat pack

02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:18,640
and in a way about flat hub is that flat

02:25:17,359 --> 02:25:22,399
pack is not

02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:24,000
tied to single store so while flat hub

02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:27,120
is de facto place to

02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:30,240
get your app built

02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,640
or or get your apps from then there's

02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:33,760
also

02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,760
an elementary

02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
store on the way and fedora other has

02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:41,280
its own

02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,479
so flatback itself is independent and

02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:45,439
flat hub

02:25:42,479 --> 02:25:48,080
while obviously again some people work

02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:50,560
on both stuff

02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:50,560
it's not

02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,040
driving flatback development

02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:58,880
and flathead itself on the same note is

02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:01,760
completely

02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:03,120
independent committee project with lots

02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:06,960
of people involved

02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:10,000
um some of the companies donating time

02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:12,160
are red hat endless or code thing and

02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,960
also multiple hardware sponsors or

02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:16,399
service sponsors help out with flat hub

02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:19,600
which is

02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:20,640
mighty beasts providing some base

02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:24,000
servers that

02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:26,399
are serving the repo also fastly which

02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,240
which does the cdn or equinix metal

02:26:26,399 --> 02:26:32,960
which donates or they build infra

02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:33,600
there's obviously many more companies

02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:36,000
helping

02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:37,280
out either with flashback or flat hub

02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,560
runtimes or

02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:41,760
helping out with various services that

02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:45,200
flat hub is using

02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:46,840
which i obviously we are all thankful

02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:48,800
for

02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:52,080
uh but uh

02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:55,040
i i i it's not possible that i will

02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:55,760
remember everyone so sorry if i forgot

02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:58,240
about you

02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:59,920
and uh i'm pretty sure we are listed on

02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:03,120
our website

02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:06,399
uh so this is what flat hub

02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:09,040
is let's talk about

02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:11,280
what we have been doing or planned to do

02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:14,560
in the future

02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:15,439
so this is a graph of flat up

02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:18,640
applications

02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:20,319
from september um the

02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:21,920
latest graph is a little bit wrong

02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:24,960
because we broke

02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:28,240
the api used to calculate

02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:29,520
available apps but the bottom line of

02:27:28,240 --> 02:27:31,760
this graph is that

02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,359
we have a steady growth first since

02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:38,640
laptop started

02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:40,880
and we are currently at 961 applications

02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,760
and in fact there's a little bit more

02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:44,240
because

02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:45,200
since i created the slides we have added

02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:47,920
two more

02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:49,600
and there's a number of apps available

02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:52,720
only in flat hub beta

02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:56,960
for various reasons like chrome but

02:27:52,720 --> 02:28:00,000
also chromium brave browser

02:27:56,960 --> 02:28:03,120
and few more so we are

02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,640
getting pretty close to one thousand um

02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,439
whether we will actually get to one

02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:12,160
thousand we will this year we will see

02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:12,880
um however uh the number of apps doesn't

02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:16,160
mean much

02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:19,600
if you have no users

02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:22,640
so uh let's see at something

02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:25,120
more interesting than just number of the

02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:27,760
applications

02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:28,640
this is the graph of flat hub downloads

02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:32,080
which is

02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:35,840
well very unreadable because um

02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:39,040
the traffic differs depending on the

02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:41,200
available updates and then it starts

02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:42,960
non-trivial to calculate when someone's

02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:46,560
actually installing a new app

02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:49,359
or just updating it uh

02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:50,080
however the the gist of this trend is

02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:53,280
that

02:28:50,080 --> 02:28:55,760
um more people are using flathead

02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:58,000
since we started which obviously is a

02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:01,120
great thing

02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,760
more or actually better better place to

02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,680
check

02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:05,840
whether we have more users or not would

02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:08,560
be cdn provided by fastly

02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,040
so here we go as you can see the the

02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:12,240
graph

02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:14,880
is increasingly growing

02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:16,399
the black lines are the moments when i

02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:18,560
was trying to improve something in the

02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:21,760
configuration usually breaking something

02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:24,319
which which is you can see here

02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:26,720
this this laws in the graph this is

02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:29,280
usually me breaking something

02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:29,920
um yeah but things are pretty stable

02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:33,680
these days

02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:37,680
and yeah we have only more

02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:40,080
traffic nowadays

02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:42,240
yeah and the funny thing about growth is

02:29:40,080 --> 02:29:42,880
that at some point we just couldn't keep

02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:46,800
up with

02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:50,560
the traffic so at some point

02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:50,800
our servers decided that we no longer

02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:53,840
are

02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:55,200
able to surf all the requests that were

02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:57,439
coming from the cdn

02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,960
so as you can see this is called

02:29:57,439 --> 02:30:02,399
misatancy in in

02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:06,720
cdn terms and this growth

02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:09,600
of miss latancy was just causing errors

02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:10,479
uh pretty much meaning that we were

02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:12,560
unable

02:30:10,479 --> 02:30:13,840
actually you were unable to install new

02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:16,960
applications or or

02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:18,880
runtimes so

02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:20,720
with my infrastructure hat on the

02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:23,840
biggest changes here is that we

02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:27,600
actually work properly these days

02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:30,160
and everything uh works

02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:34,240
fast when you for example try to

02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:34,240
download something bigger from flat hub

02:30:38,319 --> 02:30:42,560
the biggest addition this year is

02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:45,280
firefox which

02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:46,399
has been in the works for like two years

02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,680
i think

02:30:46,399 --> 02:30:52,880
with many many people involved

02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:56,399
so nowadays firefox is on

02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:56,960
flat hub on both flat up stable and flat

02:30:56,399 --> 02:31:00,560
hub

02:30:56,960 --> 02:31:03,439
beta and it's not

02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:05,120
maintained by us or some random shady

02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:08,399
guy who submitted this but

02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:11,439
just by mozilla themselves so

02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:13,840
new versions of firefox are published

02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:15,600
on the same day when the release happens

02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:17,680
and it's actually plugged in into

02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:20,080
mozilla's automation so when

02:31:17,680 --> 02:31:22,240
new i don't know windows installers or

02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:22,800
linux servers are uploaded to ftp

02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:26,800
servers

02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:26,800
it's also pushed directly to flat hub

02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:33,439
i'm actually using this since february

02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:35,920
and it works just great i uh

02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:37,760
literally removed firefox shipped with

02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:41,280
fedora because

02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,800
why wouldn't i it's mozilla's firefox

02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,800
work just fine

02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:47,359
there's also a better version available

02:31:44,800 --> 02:31:50,160
in firefox in flathop beta

02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:50,880
so if you are interested in in testing

02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:53,359
new features

02:31:50,880 --> 02:31:53,920
then please give it a shot and in the

02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:56,479
future

02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:57,520
we also plan to ship nicely and

02:31:56,479 --> 02:32:00,560
developer edition

02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:02,640
so you can test basically full life

02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:06,160
cycle of firefox with for

02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:09,120
installable apps um

02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:11,040
yeah so basically everything is great

02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:14,240
right

02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:16,080
graphs are growing new apps are being

02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:19,120
submitted and published

02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:24,000
and there is nothing to complain about

02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:26,560
um yeah so

02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,359
my opinion usual opinion is that

02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:30,160
everything

02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:31,200
could be better um because i'm from

02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:32,960
poland

02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:35,120
and if there's a single thing we are

02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:38,479
good at is complaining

02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:41,920
uh so let's have a look at

02:32:38,479 --> 02:32:45,200
um what we plan to improve

02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:46,160
or what could be improved but there are

02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:49,920
no

02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:52,560
answers so

02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:54,720
one of the challenges you likely haven't

02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:56,720
noticed because it's completely

02:32:54,720 --> 02:32:59,280
hidden stuff is that we have a new

02:32:56,720 --> 02:33:02,800
backend which is why we broke

02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:06,720
a graph of new apps that

02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:09,840
andrew can tell you about in the chat

02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:11,600
um the new backend is written in python

02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:13,760
so this is actually great because

02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:14,720
more people can contribute the the whole

02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:17,680
one was in java

02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:19,760
and it turns out that most of java the

02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:21,680
developers are apparently busy with

02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:24,399
writing and draft enterprise stuff

02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:25,280
instead of contributing to open source

02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:28,720
so

02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:31,840
that's uh good news one of the

02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:34,960
changes that new backend brought was

02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:38,399
a new search which sounds great

02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:40,240
but results are pretty terrible so for

02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:42,960
example if you go to flathub.org

02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:43,359
right now and type video into the search

02:33:42,960 --> 02:33:46,080
bar

02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:46,399
and you are pretty sure that you will

02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:50,399
see

02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:53,760
ptv on the very bottom of the results so

02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:56,960
there's a lot of room for improvements

02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:59,359
either by right now switching the tool

02:33:56,960 --> 02:34:02,720
used for providing search or

02:33:59,359 --> 02:34:04,479
whatever else i'm mostly hammering

02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:06,080
servers and not writing back and

02:34:04,479 --> 02:34:08,319
services so

02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:10,880
i'm always open to to hear some

02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:10,880
suggestions

02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:15,520
the other thing is the website website

02:34:14,479 --> 02:34:19,680
hasn't changed much

02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:19,680
since flat hub exists um

02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,680
which is again not a terrible thing

02:34:22,399 --> 02:34:25,920
because

02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,720
the website itself looks great however

02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:30,240
it could

02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:31,120
be better so some folks from the

02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,640
community

02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:35,680
uh are working on new website and new

02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:39,359
design which will

02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:43,120
look more like gnome software or

02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:44,960
kde discover if you

02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:46,319
zoom in on the site you can actually see

02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:49,359
the uh

02:34:46,319 --> 02:34:52,800
actual address where this however

02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:54,000
it's obviously not being automatically

02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:56,560
updated on

02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:58,080
any new updates or anything like this

02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:00,479
this is just a proof of

02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:02,319
concept how things may look in the

02:35:00,479 --> 02:35:05,920
future

02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:08,560
and on that note um

02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:09,280
the details of the apps will also look

02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:11,280
differently

02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,319
this is more or less how it currently

02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:15,760
looks like

02:35:12,319 --> 02:35:18,479
so a logo short description screenshots

02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:19,280
longer description and some additional

02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:23,439
information

02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:27,200
and urls to various websites

02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:30,319
the current idea is like this however

02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:34,800
this also brings many questions

02:35:30,319 --> 02:35:36,880
of what could be also included so

02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:38,800
for example gnome software and kd

02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:42,479
discover have access to

02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:45,200
odrs which has some reviews then

02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:46,160
the question is whether we really want

02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:48,000
to

02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:50,160
show some random reviews when there is

02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:53,280
no easy way to tell whether

02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:54,960
someone reviewed the app on fedora or

02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:58,160
debian or arch

02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:59,520
or actually from platform then we are

02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:03,439
also wondering how to

02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:07,120
show console applications because

02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:08,479
that count of apps from before didn't

02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:11,280
include them because

02:36:08,479 --> 02:36:11,840
at the moment we are ignoring existence

02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:15,760
of

02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:18,720
cli apps and

02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:19,760
then some applications also have

02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:23,359
extensions

02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:23,680
whether they provide some fancy features

02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:27,920
for

02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:28,240
chat or i don't know bluegate plugins

02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,359
for

02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:32,960
for viewing youtube videos in totem

02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:34,840
that's currently completely not

02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:38,880
displayed on the website

02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:41,920
hurting well discoverability of features

02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:45,760
um yeah so obviously

02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:48,880
we will see this is all

02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:52,080
work in progress i see mike

02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:55,439
complaining about skinny shots um

02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:55,439
that happens sorry

02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,720
um yeah so that's about a user facing

02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:04,560
part

02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:07,280
however one thing i'm

02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:09,439
very unhappy about is the general

02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:13,120
developer experience

02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:15,760
um so for example

02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:18,160
this is how the submission process looks

02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:21,200
nowadays so you need to fork our main

02:37:18,160 --> 02:37:23,359
git repository on github then

02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:25,120
create new branch from specific branch

02:37:23,359 --> 02:37:28,240
called new pr

02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:30,319
add your manifester commit push

02:37:28,240 --> 02:37:33,120
blah blah blah and create a new pull

02:37:30,319 --> 02:37:35,760
request to that original repository

02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,560
uh making sure that we have pressed

02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:39,120
click

02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:41,760
button for origin branch and then you

02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:46,160
are waiting for the review from

02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:49,359
me or for other people or if that

02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:52,479
new submissions and

02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:53,040
then when you build kicks in it turns

02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:54,880
out that

02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:56,399
for some reason you are missing icon

02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:58,240
files or

02:37:56,399 --> 02:38:01,680
you are missing meta info file in

02:37:58,240 --> 02:38:05,120
general then

02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:07,120
arch 64 also face to build

02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:08,640
something else has to be because you

02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:11,680
have no network access

02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:14,960
then it turns out that you have left

02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:17,439
lots of static libraries

02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:18,479
in your application meaning that your

02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:21,439
app is

02:38:18,479 --> 02:38:23,680
much bigger than it should be or because

02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:26,240
you are not very interested in tracking

02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:28,560
numbers you forgot

02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:29,840
that there's a new runtime available so

02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:31,920
you have using

02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,479
the old one which might be not

02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:39,280
maintained anymore or for long

02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:43,680
so to actually fix that um

02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:46,880
i'm thinking about preparing some

02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,680
i don't know inter but this is very very

02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:52,240
long

02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:52,240
um very very long

02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:59,840
subject so our documentation is poor

02:38:56,319 --> 02:39:02,960
um there's no winter

02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:04,800
so we are actually going

02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:07,200
line by line looking at the yama files

02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:08,000
doing 3d phase and then leaving comments

02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:10,720
that something

02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,600
is wrong what could be to know better

02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:14,960
and

02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:17,439
for submission that's

02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:18,160
again my slides are not changing i'm

02:39:17,439 --> 02:39:21,120
talking

02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:22,960
still about the same stuff i will change

02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:26,160
slide in a minute

02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:28,399
uh yeah so we could provide a web ui for

02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:30,319
either submission using github api for

02:39:28,399 --> 02:39:34,080
example or maybe just some

02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:37,920
simple upload upload form

02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:38,640
um yeah this is basically something

02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:41,680
that's

02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,880
very open to discussion and uh we would

02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:45,920
love to hear

02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:47,680
how the ideal process would look like

02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:53,439
maybe based on your experiences with

02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:56,080
google play or apple store

02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:57,040
the other thing is that when you are a

02:39:56,080 --> 02:40:00,000
maintainer

02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:01,040
um you could probably use more

02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,399
automation because

02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:06,160
at the moment you are pretty much on

02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:08,319
your own so when you're is out

02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:09,600
which you might not know about you

02:40:08,319 --> 02:40:11,920
should bump it

02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:14,240
or at some point it will produce a

02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:16,160
warning that your runtime is

02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:18,160
unmaintained but it will be displayed

02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:20,000
only to users and not to you

02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:22,080
so what would be cool is to actually

02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,080
notify maintainers that there are new

02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:26,319
runtime reviews

02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:26,319
um

02:40:28,479 --> 02:40:33,279
cve tracker so when you're bundling your

02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:36,000
dependencies

02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:37,120
something could be checking whether they

02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,200
are outdated or not

02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,800
this is currently missing there are

02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:41,760
there are various tools that are

02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:43,439
providing

02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:45,439
such features but we are currently not

02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:48,880
using them at all

02:40:45,439 --> 02:40:49,600
and in the results some people complain

02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:52,560
that

02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:54,720
apps are checking updated libraries and

02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:58,160
and so on and so on

02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:59,840
and the last thing that at least i

02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:01,279
as a developer would personally be

02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:04,479
interested in

02:41:01,279 --> 02:41:06,960
would be um that when i create

02:41:04,479 --> 02:41:07,600
a new release on my original repo with

02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:11,120
the code

02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:13,600
then something picks it up and tries to

02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:15,760
figure out whether it builds on flat hub

02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:18,800
or not and then just leaves and open

02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:21,200
the request that we can accept and

02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:21,200
it's done

02:41:22,479 --> 02:41:27,279
so obviously being a community open

02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:30,399
source project

02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:35,279
we need help so this

02:41:30,399 --> 02:41:35,279
is again vast subject

02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:39,760
most important thing obviously is that

02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:41,359
we want new applications so

02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:43,439
if there's something that you are using

02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:45,600
or would like to be using but

02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:47,279
your distribution is not packaging this

02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:50,479
please submit your app

02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:54,319
however first talk to the

02:41:50,479 --> 02:41:57,439
applications developers um

02:41:54,319 --> 02:42:00,479
and this is actually kind of chicken and

02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:00,479
add problem because

02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:05,760
we technically could be rejecting

02:42:03,520 --> 02:42:07,439
applications that are not accepted by

02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,040
option developers however we wouldn't

02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:13,520
have applications at all then

02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:14,640
so doing developer advocacy job is also

02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:17,520
very important so

02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:18,960
poking upstream is right i could be

02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:21,760
using flat pack and

02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:22,240
why it's great it's it's very important

02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:25,279
job

02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:27,600
um yeah as i've said before

02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:30,000
documentation is other terrible so

02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:31,200
if you have any general remarks about

02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,359
documentation or

02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:34,319
would like to write a proper

02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:37,680
documentation

02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:40,880
for us to be much much

02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:43,520
appreciated and

02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:44,479
development of course because i'm

02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:46,080
terrible at this

02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:47,920
and while you have some people working

02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:51,040
on that and

02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:54,399
it's always nice to

02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:57,359
hear what could have been done better

02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:58,240
and if you are already a maintainer

02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:00,720
please

02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:02,160
reach out to us because sometimes it's

02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:06,000
very hard to know what

02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:06,000
is wrong when you are not

02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:11,520
outsider so being here for over three

02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
years working with that hub

02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:14,640
i take some things for granted we all do

02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,160
so

02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:21,600
if you have any feedback even even very

02:43:18,160 --> 02:43:23,680
general one not uh not nothing

02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:25,840
nothing specific but just hey your

02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:27,120
documentation sucks please get in touch

02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:29,920
that's

02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:32,800
gonna be very helpful even if without

02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:37,040
even without details

02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:39,200
thank you

02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:41,439
i think there are questions in the short

02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:41,439
note

02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:45,359
yeah my name is bartomi that l with

02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:48,720
slash

02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:50,160
is way in my in my language it's pretty

02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:52,479
crazy don't think about the stuff for

02:43:50,160 --> 02:43:52,479
too long

02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:57,920
thank you so much okay yeah um

02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,080
thank you for your talk it was um quite

02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,800
um engaging on the chat and

02:44:00,080 --> 02:44:04,319
um interesting as well i see that you

02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:07,120
started with the first question

02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:07,600
of course i also want to know how your

02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:11,600
name is

02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:14,160
yeah okay

02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:15,439
and so i'll just go on to the second

02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:18,160
question

02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:20,160
are there plans to provide devs we use

02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:22,479
flat or to distribute apps to get a

02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:25,680
report on how many downloads how many

02:44:22,479 --> 02:44:28,560
clicks on donate

02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:30,000
um yeah absolutely i mean there are

02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:31,840
plans for almost everything

02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,200
and we are actually moving slowly

02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:36,479
towards having

02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:40,000
a proper proper statistics page

02:44:36,479 --> 02:44:40,720
available to anyone there is a raw data

02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,520
available

02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:44,840
on the website i have it somewhere in

02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:47,840
the slides here

02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:47,840
um

02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:53,840
here in the bottom right corner is

02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:56,960
flathop.org

02:44:53,840 --> 02:45:00,000
stats so this is raw json files

02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:02,000
that you can use to produce a

02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:04,640
graph or whatever but we plan to

02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,760
integrate this into the website

02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:09,200
okay great thank you um next question is

02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:11,680
how long does it take

02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:13,600
um on average for a project to get to

02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:16,560
get reviewed

02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:17,200
so nobody is technically paid on working

02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:20,399
on

02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:23,680
flat hubs so it usually takes a day

02:45:20,399 --> 02:45:24,800
two or three but rarely the longer than

02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:27,520
this

02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:28,080
um we usually have some feedback so it's

02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:31,520
a little bit

02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:32,080
of ping pong game until we arrive at

02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:35,279
some

02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:37,439
accessible solution but it rarely takes

02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:40,160
longer than a week

02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:42,000
okay um great we still have more

02:45:40,160 --> 02:45:43,920
questions coming up so i'm just going to

02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,160
do that as fast as i can

02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:47,439
so what is the workflow when you already

02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:52,640
have the flat uh

02:45:47,439 --> 02:45:56,240
packages on files in the apps git repo

02:45:52,640 --> 02:45:59,279
so uh yeah the workflow is

02:45:56,240 --> 02:46:00,000
pretty much i i have described this in

02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:03,439
the slide

02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,399
somewhere um which uh it's not ideal but

02:46:03,439 --> 02:46:07,120
it is what it is

02:46:04,399 --> 02:46:08,479
so you fork the main flathead repo add

02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:11,359
your files there

02:46:08,479 --> 02:46:13,680
and then submit this as a pull request

02:46:11,359 --> 02:46:16,720
and then eventually we create a new

02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:18,720
repository under flathead organization

02:46:16,720 --> 02:46:20,880
on github where only the manifest should

02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:23,840
be stored

02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:24,399
great um so we'll going to the fifth

02:46:23,840 --> 02:46:25,920
question

02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:28,479
uh what is the current project

02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:31,439
governance

02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:32,240
um yeah so that's a little bit tricky we

02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:35,359
have had

02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:38,560
a call on governance few months back

02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:41,359
with gnome and kde false but

02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:44,319
a little bit like with um any open

02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:47,600
source project it's uh dual classy so

02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:50,840
if someone comes up and does the work

02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:52,319
then he's usually the one deciding about

02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:55,439
something

02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:56,640
interesting um so i think the last

02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:59,040
question is going to be

02:46:56,640 --> 02:47:01,279
has any projects been removed from flat

02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:01,279
off

02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:07,680
um oh

02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:11,040
from the top of my mind we have removed

02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:13,279
an application that cassidy from

02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:16,240
elementary did because it had been

02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:19,600
submitted without his permission

02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:23,359
uh i don't think anything else

02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:25,600
has been removed um okay

02:47:23,359 --> 02:47:27,920
um thank you so much bath i think i will

02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:30,399
have to keep um calling you back

02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:30,960
for now until i'm able to pronounce your

02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:32,399
name

02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:34,240
and thank you for your talk respect

02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:37,040
interesting and so many

02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:37,439
engaging discussion um on the public

02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:39,760
chat

02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:42,319
um so if you have more questions for

02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:45,040
that you can um reach your mouth and

02:47:42,319 --> 02:47:47,040
also continue the chat on public chat um

02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:50,399
right now we're going to be going on

02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:55,040
a 10 minute break

02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:03,840
talk

02:48:00,479 --> 02:48:06,319
on women interface guidelines

02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:07,279
for now we can continue the conversation

02:48:06,319 --> 02:48:10,160

03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:26,080
talk about human interface guidelines

03:07:23,120 --> 03:07:28,560
and the roles they play in an ecosystem

03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:30,640
how they help with consistency and speed

03:07:28,560 --> 03:07:33,760
up development

03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:35,760

hello everyone my name is fabian

03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:07,359
litmeier

03:08:04,720 --> 03:08:09,200
i'm going to talk about human interface

03:08:07,359 --> 03:08:10,640
guidelines and the roles they play in an

03:08:09,200 --> 03:08:13,439
ecosystem

03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:15,279
how they help with consistency and speed

03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:18,160
up development

03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:21,279
i've been working on kde zoom interface

03:08:18,160 --> 03:08:24,479
guidelines for the last couple of years

03:08:21,279 --> 03:08:27,840
my work is primarily focused on focused

03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:30,319
on improving the structure presentation

03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:32,840
and the existing content and not so much

03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:34,319
in creating new content creating new

03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:38,240
interface

03:08:34,319 --> 03:08:38,240
patterns or ui elements

03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:46,960
so just a short what i'm going to talk

03:08:45,760 --> 03:08:48,720
about

03:08:46,960 --> 03:08:51,040
first what is a human interface

03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:54,479
guideline then i'm gonna show

03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:57,200
a couple an overview of some

03:08:54,479 --> 03:08:58,319
existing human interface guidelines talk

03:08:57,200 --> 03:09:00,319
about the role of

03:08:58,319 --> 03:09:01,600
human interface guidelines in an

03:09:00,319 --> 03:09:04,080
ecosystem

03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:04,880
and take a more detailed look into

03:09:04,080 --> 03:09:09,200
aspects

03:09:04,880 --> 03:09:09,200
of human interface guidelines

03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:20,319
so what is the user interface it's the

03:09:18,319 --> 03:09:22,080
space where interactions happen between

03:09:20,319 --> 03:09:23,840
humans and machines

03:09:22,080 --> 03:09:25,279
this is a very broad definition it

03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:27,120
covers a lot

03:09:25,279 --> 03:09:28,560
a whole lot more than just computers and

03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:31,120
mobile phones

03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:33,520
but it also covers every kind of heavy

03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:37,200
machinery operator controls or

03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:38,640
industrial processes the user interface

03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:41,359
typically consists of

03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:42,399
some physical input device for the human

03:09:41,359 --> 03:09:44,640
to interact

03:09:42,399 --> 03:09:46,640
and one or more output devices for the

03:09:44,640 --> 03:09:49,040
machine to interact

03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:49,840
the most common input devices are

03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:52,960
keyboards

03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:54,239
mice gamepads remote controls touch

03:09:52,960 --> 03:09:56,640
screens

03:09:54,239 --> 03:09:58,479
and the most common output devices are

03:09:56,640 --> 03:09:59,600
for visual feedback like monitors or

03:09:58,479 --> 03:10:02,319
printers

03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:03,680
or auditory feedback like speakers but

03:10:02,319 --> 03:10:06,560
you can have output

03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:08,800
devices for all other human senses as

03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:08,800
well

03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:16,399
one more well-known example would be the

03:10:12,800 --> 03:10:18,800
false feedback controller for consoles

03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:21,040
like the xbox or the playstation

03:10:18,800 --> 03:10:22,479
where you have uh feedback from the

03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:27,040
machine

03:10:22,479 --> 03:10:29,040
by when the controller vibrates

03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:30,560
the human interface guidelines are a set

03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:32,880
of rules

03:10:30,560 --> 03:10:34,080
to guide interaction between humans and

03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:40,960
for this talk at least

03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:44,880
desktops and mobile phones

03:10:40,960 --> 03:10:46,880
let's get on to some examples so

03:10:44,880 --> 03:10:49,439
many different unit interface guidelines

03:10:46,880 --> 03:10:49,439
on the web

03:10:50,560 --> 03:10:55,439
um the most common ones or the worst

03:10:53,520 --> 03:10:56,960
well-known ones are those for the large

03:10:55,439 --> 03:10:59,920
ecosystems for example

03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:01,920
google material design for android ios

03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:05,200
flutter and the web

03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:08,640
i guess everyone has seen it in

03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:11,120
some way or the other or apple human

03:11:08,640 --> 03:11:12,479
interface guidelines

03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:14,319
actually apple provides not one

03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:17,359
guideline but four

03:11:14,319 --> 03:11:19,760
the way google has one big guideline

03:11:17,359 --> 03:11:20,960
that covers everything apple provides a

03:11:19,760 --> 03:11:24,080
set of guidelines

03:11:20,960 --> 03:11:25,279
one from mac os one for ios one for

03:11:24,080 --> 03:11:29,600
watch os

03:11:25,279 --> 03:11:29,600
and one for tv os

03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:35,520
of course

03:11:32,470 --> 03:11:37,760
[Music]

03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:39,680
of course microsoft has its own human

03:11:37,760 --> 03:11:42,880
interface guidelines too

03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:44,160
or rather several of them and they have

03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:46,399
a

03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:47,359
guideline for the universal windows

03:11:46,399 --> 03:11:50,640
platform

03:11:47,359 --> 03:11:54,560
they have one for windows 30

03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:55,680
to 32 one for windows presentation

03:11:54,560 --> 03:11:59,040
foundations

03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:00,880
and one for windows forms and while

03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:02,560
apple has four guidelines too it's

03:12:00,880 --> 03:12:05,200
pretty straightforward

03:12:02,560 --> 03:12:07,760
which one to choose depending on the

03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:10,000
device you want to develop for

03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:10,960
but if you want to develop for microsoft

03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,720
you need to choose

03:12:10,960 --> 03:12:14,239
human interface guideline depending on

03:12:12,720 --> 03:12:17,279
the technology you want

03:12:14,239 --> 03:12:18,160
to develop this for you need to choose

03:12:17,279 --> 03:12:22,960
the technology

03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:22,960
you want to develop with um by

03:12:23,840 --> 03:12:29,760
if you want to

03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:31,760
develop against one particular human

03:12:29,760 --> 03:12:34,720
interface guideline

03:12:31,760 --> 03:12:36,479
in my opinion it's pretty unfortunate to

03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:37,359
have a different human interface

03:12:36,479 --> 03:12:39,920
guidelines

03:12:37,359 --> 03:12:40,560
for different technologies because it

03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:46,800
makes it

03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:51,520
so much harder to choose

03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:54,640
so then of course there's a gnome humans

03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:54,640
interface guidelines

03:12:54,960 --> 03:13:02,160
and kde human interface guidelines

03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:04,080
actually when i started to work at kde

03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:06,880
human interface guidelines we had

03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:08,080
a similar problem as microsoft has now

03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:09,920
or still has

03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:11,359
we had two human interface guidelines

03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:13,840
you had to choose between

03:13:11,359 --> 03:13:15,040
depending on the technology you wanted

03:13:13,840 --> 03:13:17,040
to develop this

03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:18,640
on the one hand there was a classic huge

03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:22,000
widget one

03:13:18,640 --> 03:13:24,880
and on the other hand there was a qml in

03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:27,920
kirigami one with a new set of controls

03:13:24,880 --> 03:13:29,760
ui elements and navigational patterns

03:13:27,920 --> 03:13:32,000
and to some extent we still have this

03:13:29,760 --> 03:13:33,120
problem but as qml and kirigamin

03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:35,840
achieved

03:13:33,120 --> 03:13:37,840
things improved quite a bit and we are

03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:39,359
back to only have one guideline for both

03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:41,760
worlds

03:13:39,359 --> 03:13:42,800
but all these human interface guidelines

03:13:41,760 --> 03:13:45,279
i just

03:13:42,800 --> 03:13:47,760
showed have in common they cover a very

03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:49,279
very wide range a wide range of devices

03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:51,680
a wide range of use cases for

03:13:49,279 --> 03:13:53,760
applications

03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:54,840
there are all kinds of applications in

03:13:53,760 --> 03:13:58,160
each of these

03:13:54,840 --> 03:14:00,239
environments but human enterprise

03:13:58,160 --> 03:14:02,479
space guidelines with a very different

03:14:00,239 --> 03:14:04,960
very much narrowed scope

03:14:02,479 --> 03:14:04,960
as well

03:14:08,560 --> 03:14:12,880
for example there's a human interface

03:14:10,319 --> 03:14:16,239
guideline for lg's web os

03:14:12,880 --> 03:14:18,479
for the that are just narrative scopes

03:14:16,239 --> 03:14:20,880
are just for tvs

03:14:18,479 --> 03:14:22,880
so they only target one class of devices

03:14:20,880 --> 03:14:25,439
and are only a very reduced set of

03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:28,319
applications

03:14:25,439 --> 03:14:29,439
the applications you typically find on

03:14:28,319 --> 03:14:31,840
the tv are

03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:33,200
smaller and less complex than in the

03:14:31,840 --> 03:14:36,800
other environments

03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:39,840
we saw earlier in center round of the

03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:39,840
consumer of media

03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:54,560
but it's uh but also something like

03:14:52,720 --> 03:14:56,239
literal office has its own set of

03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:58,080
guidelines so it's not only human

03:14:56,239 --> 03:15:00,399
interface guidelines for platform

03:14:58,080 --> 03:15:01,120
ecosystems or devices but there are

03:15:00,399 --> 03:15:03,279
human error

03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:05,439
there's a human interface guidelines for

03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:07,600
applications for single applications as

03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:09,600
well

03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:12,880
like you can see here from the libra

03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,880
office or

03:15:13,680 --> 03:15:21,840
there's a human interface guideline

03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:21,840
from blender

03:15:22,160 --> 03:15:26,319
so after we saw some examples of

03:15:24,239 --> 03:15:27,359
different human interface guidelines you

03:15:26,319 --> 03:15:30,239
can find in

03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:32,560
the web what else what role are they

03:15:30,239 --> 03:15:34,560
actually playing in an ecosystem

03:15:32,560 --> 03:15:35,920
let's see what some of the human

03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:39,760
interface guidelines

03:15:35,920 --> 03:15:39,760
themselves say about the role

03:15:45,359 --> 03:15:50,479
this is from kde so the kde unit

03:15:48,399 --> 03:15:52,560
interface guideline offers designers and

03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:53,760
developers a set of recommendations for

03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:56,319
producing

03:15:53,760 --> 03:15:57,279
beautiful usable and consistent user

03:15:56,319 --> 03:15:58,720
interfaces from

03:15:57,279 --> 03:16:00,720
convergent desktop and mobile

03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:03,600
applications and

03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:04,960
workspace widgets the aim is to improve

03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:06,880
the experience for users

03:16:04,960 --> 03:16:08,880
by making applications and glitches

03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:12,080
widget interfaces more consistent and

03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:17,840
hence more intuitive and learnable

03:16:12,080 --> 03:16:17,840
let's take a look at the second one

03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:22,640
this is from google build beautiful

03:16:21,279 --> 03:16:25,040
products faster

03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:26,640
material is a design system that help

03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:30,319
teams build high quality

03:16:26,640 --> 03:16:32,160
digital experiences use our most popular

03:16:30,319 --> 03:16:33,520
design and development resources to

03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:36,640
jumpstart

03:16:33,520 --> 03:16:36,640
your latest project

03:16:38,399 --> 03:16:44,160
they have pretty much they have we have

03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:46,960
two

03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:47,760
core aspects mentioned in this human

03:16:46,960 --> 03:16:51,200
interface

03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:54,239
in these descriptions one

03:16:51,200 --> 03:16:58,800
consistency and the other one

03:16:54,239 --> 03:17:01,040
is speed up design and development

03:16:58,800 --> 03:17:02,560
consistency is about creating a sense of

03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:06,880
control familiar

03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:09,520
familiarity and reliability for the user

03:17:06,880 --> 03:17:10,239
consistency increases usability

03:17:09,520 --> 03:17:12,319
something

03:17:10,239 --> 03:17:13,600
a user learned once can be applied over

03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:17,120
and over again in the same

03:17:13,600 --> 03:17:19,120
ecosystem the other major point is

03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:20,960
human interface guidelines try to speed

03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:24,080
up design and development

03:17:20,960 --> 03:17:25,840
for example by providing design examples

03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:29,279
or giving standard

03:17:25,840 --> 03:17:29,279
solutions for common problems

03:17:36,080 --> 03:17:40,239
so how do human interface guidelines

03:17:38,399 --> 03:17:42,479
have in achieving these goals let's take

03:17:40,239 --> 03:17:43,840
a look at two core parts of typical user

03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:46,080
interface guidelines

03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:46,960
navigation patterns patterns and

03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:49,040
components

03:17:46,960 --> 03:17:55,840
and how they help to achieve consistency

03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:55,840
and speed up development

03:18:04,399 --> 03:18:09,600
navigation patterns navigation does

03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:11,840
something very fundamental for every app

03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:13,120
navigation patterns are the way a user

03:18:11,840 --> 03:18:14,640
is supposed to move through an

03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:16,000
application

03:18:14,640 --> 03:18:18,399
there are different different ways a

03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:21,040
user could move through an application

03:18:18,399 --> 03:18:23,439
you can move geographic up and down in

03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:25,920
an application

03:18:23,439 --> 03:18:26,880
you can move lateral between the same

03:18:25,920 --> 03:18:29,920
level of

03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:29,920
in the application

03:18:31,840 --> 03:18:38,080
you can reverse either in history

03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:41,200
or hierarchy like

03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:44,399
going back in the browser or

03:18:41,200 --> 03:18:45,760
in the mobile applications or you can

03:18:44,399 --> 03:18:47,680
have jumps like

03:18:45,760 --> 03:18:49,359
most hyperlinks and websites are where

03:18:47,680 --> 03:18:52,479
you just jump from one

03:18:49,359 --> 03:18:55,680
point to the other without them very

03:18:52,479 --> 03:18:55,680
just jump directly

03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:06,880
there are lots and lots of navigation

03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:10,479
patterns to achieve

03:19:06,880 --> 03:19:12,319
this hamburger menus tabs vertical

03:19:10,479 --> 03:19:14,560
navigation breadcrumbs

03:19:12,319 --> 03:19:16,880
menus bottom bars expandable lists

03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:19,279
wizards collapsible content dialogues

03:19:16,880 --> 03:19:21,200
carousels column-based navigation and so

03:19:19,279 --> 03:19:23,120
on

03:19:21,200 --> 03:19:25,279
typically you want only a subset of

03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:26,880
these patterns in your ecosystem

03:19:25,279 --> 03:19:29,200
to choose the right one or the right

03:19:26,880 --> 03:19:30,319
ones because most of the time one needs

03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:33,840
to combine multiple

03:19:30,319 --> 03:19:36,560
of cs is very fundamental to an app

03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:37,680
the one key role of a human interface

03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:39,439
guideline is help

03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:40,800
for the designers and developers to

03:19:39,439 --> 03:19:42,080
choose the right pattern for an

03:19:40,800 --> 03:19:44,239
ecosystem

03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:47,840
because not all patterns will fit into

03:19:44,239 --> 03:19:47,840
your ecosystem

03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:54,399
some patterns just fell out of time like

03:19:52,239 --> 03:19:58,560
this collapsible sidebar panels

03:19:54,399 --> 03:20:01,200
in mozilla's free firefox web browser so

03:19:58,560 --> 03:20:02,880
you would click on here and then the

03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:04,640
content would expand and the other

03:20:02,880 --> 03:20:06,880
content would collapse

03:20:04,640 --> 03:20:08,080
i don't think this pattern is used

03:20:06,880 --> 03:20:10,319
anywhere

03:20:08,080 --> 03:20:11,200
anywhere anymore at least not in a

03:20:10,319 --> 03:20:13,120
sidebar

03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:14,239
today you would probably use some kind

03:20:13,120 --> 03:20:15,920
of props

03:20:14,239 --> 03:20:17,359
on the top to switch between the

03:20:15,920 --> 03:20:29,120
contents

03:20:17,359 --> 03:20:31,760
or a vertical sidebar

03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:32,800
some patterns work only for some screen

03:20:31,760 --> 03:20:35,840
sizes

03:20:32,800 --> 03:20:38,720
like this vertical sidebar

03:20:35,840 --> 03:20:40,840
it works great on a tv on a mobile phone

03:20:38,720 --> 03:20:43,200
not so much because you don't have the

03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:45,359
space

03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:47,120
or they only work for some kind for some

03:20:45,359 --> 03:20:48,239
input methods like touch is not as

03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:50,080
accurate as mouse

03:20:48,239 --> 03:20:57,840
so the internet interface and the

03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:57,840
patterns need to adjust it

03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:04,080
and some patterns might just not fit the

03:21:02,080 --> 03:21:05,920
vision you have for your platform

03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:08,000
for example here is a different concept

03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:11,200
for the secondary navigation in ios and

03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:14,399
material design

03:21:11,200 --> 03:21:16,560
apple is using a more tab in the bottom

03:21:14,399 --> 03:21:17,680
bar to access navigation destinations

03:21:16,560 --> 03:21:20,800
that don't fit

03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:23,200
in the bottom bar so if you want to go

03:21:20,800 --> 03:21:24,239
somewhere here it doesn't fit in here so

03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:25,760
you have to

03:21:24,239 --> 03:21:27,840
push the more button and then you have

03:21:25,760 --> 03:21:32,399
attacked with more

03:21:27,840 --> 03:21:32,399
repair more navigation destinations

03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:36,960
on the other hand material design would

03:21:35,840 --> 03:21:39,760
use a sidebar

03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:42,239
to access additional navigation points

03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:42,239
in here

03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:45,680
they are both probably equally viable

03:21:44,479 --> 03:21:48,160
but if you want to

03:21:45,680 --> 03:21:50,000
have your app to be consistent in ios

03:21:48,160 --> 03:21:51,920
you need to choose the more tab and if

03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:52,640
you want to develop for material design

03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:56,239
you

03:21:52,640 --> 03:22:00,160
should choose the sidebar and that's

03:21:56,239 --> 03:22:03,359
something a developer or designer

03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:04,840
cannot choose for in there you have to

03:22:03,359 --> 03:22:07,840
give him

03:22:04,840 --> 03:22:07,840
hints

03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:20,800
so let's talk about um components

03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:22,000
yeah another basic element of human

03:22:20,800 --> 03:22:23,680
interface guidelines

03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:25,359
components are smaller building blocks

03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:27,840
of uis buttons

03:22:25,359 --> 03:22:35,600
check boxes radio buttons tabs cards

03:22:27,840 --> 03:22:38,720
lists and so on

03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:40,640
some general advice for human interface

03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:41,920
if you create human interface guidelines

03:22:40,640 --> 03:22:44,319
for these components

03:22:41,920 --> 03:22:46,720
give as much detail as possible details

03:22:44,319 --> 03:22:50,640
help to speed up design and development

03:22:46,720 --> 03:22:50,640
in details improve consistency

03:22:56,239 --> 03:22:59,840
you can see the difference in how much

03:22:57,840 --> 03:23:01,279
more detail google puts in its material

03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:03,760
design document

03:23:01,279 --> 03:23:05,520
documentations and apple doesn't i has

03:23:03,760 --> 03:23:08,720
documentation

03:23:05,520 --> 03:23:12,560
you have a width you have a

03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:17,840
height if you have detailed headings

03:23:12,560 --> 03:23:17,840
on ios it's just an image

03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:21,840
so when google released material design

03:23:19,760 --> 03:23:23,840
in 2014 they were

03:23:21,840 --> 03:23:26,080
one of the first or the first to add so

03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:29,520
much details

03:23:26,080 --> 03:23:31,760
specs to their guidelines and

03:23:29,520 --> 03:23:33,439
it was so much easier to reproduce these

03:23:31,760 --> 03:23:36,720
components for something new a new

03:23:33,439 --> 03:23:38,399
programming language or new framework

03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:39,760
and it's so much easier when you look

03:23:38,399 --> 03:23:42,800
around for

03:23:39,760 --> 03:23:45,040
for example for web develop web

03:23:42,800 --> 03:23:47,120
development frameworks

03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:49,359
every other web development framework

03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:52,160
looks like material design

03:23:49,359 --> 03:23:53,680
because it's so easy to recreate

03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:58,800
material design

03:23:53,680 --> 03:24:01,200
components in another technology

03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:02,239
i searched around a bit to find one that

03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:04,000
follows apple's

03:24:02,239 --> 03:24:13,680
interface guidelines and i think i found

03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:16,239
only one

03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:18,160
but details it's not only about

03:24:16,239 --> 03:24:20,640
expanding your ecosystem into new

03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:22,560
technologies or new toolkits

03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:24,080
but it also helps with the creation of

03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:26,560
new controls

03:24:24,080 --> 03:24:28,479
sooner or later some designer developer

03:24:26,560 --> 03:24:29,439
will have the need for new custom

03:24:28,479 --> 03:24:31,279
control

03:24:29,439 --> 03:24:34,960
to solve a problem that won't be covered

03:24:31,279 --> 03:24:34,960
by your human interface guidelines

03:24:37,439 --> 03:24:43,840
so just to showcase how this

03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:46,239
should could work let's say i created

03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:48,399
this very basic maybe not overly useful

03:24:46,239 --> 03:24:51,040
and important component for my all-new

03:24:48,399 --> 03:24:52,720
material design app

03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:54,080
it doesn't look like a material design

03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:55,760
component at all

03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:58,239
and in fact it doesn't look very usable

03:24:55,760 --> 03:25:00,000
or pretty it's a moment either

03:24:58,239 --> 03:25:01,920
but we can easily improve it by just

03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:03,359
applying the detailed specs

03:25:01,920 --> 03:25:05,760
we find in the material design

03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:07,680
documentation

03:25:05,760 --> 03:25:11,600
first let's add the padding design the

03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:11,600
button in the specification earlier

03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:15,920
now we have applied the padding here and

03:25:14,239 --> 03:25:20,840
here and here and here

03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:22,960
and here now it looks a lot better

03:25:20,840 --> 03:25:24,960
already in the next step

03:25:22,960 --> 03:25:26,800
let's apply the border radius typical

03:25:24,960 --> 03:25:27,920
from material components and add some

03:25:26,800 --> 03:25:30,479
drop shadow

03:25:27,920 --> 03:25:36,160
everything can be found in material

03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:39,439
design guidelines

03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:41,760
better but

03:25:39,439 --> 03:25:43,040
still not quite there so let's take a

03:25:41,760 --> 03:25:44,880
look around material design

03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:48,720
documentation for a similar control we

03:25:44,880 --> 03:25:48,720
could use to get more specifications

03:25:48,840 --> 03:25:57,040
from

03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:57,040
this is like the small card

03:25:57,439 --> 03:26:01,600
so we let's take the width and the

03:25:59,840 --> 03:26:03,840
height from this card

03:26:01,600 --> 03:26:05,680
and apply it together with the height we

03:26:03,840 --> 03:26:08,800
saw earlier on the button

03:26:05,680 --> 03:26:08,800
on our new control

03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:21,200
now it actually does look like some

03:26:17,920 --> 03:26:21,200
material design control

03:26:24,800 --> 03:26:33,840
i'm too fast

03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:41,760
it blends in nicely with other material

03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:41,760
design components

03:26:42,160 --> 03:26:46,479
and because we use the sandwich as a

03:26:44,479 --> 03:26:47,439
standard card we can easily use both of

03:26:46,479 --> 03:26:49,359
them together

03:26:47,439 --> 03:26:50,720
so we could for example use them in the

03:26:49,359 --> 03:26:53,680
same container on the same

03:26:50,720 --> 03:26:55,840
page store them together it would work

03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:57,680
very nicely

03:26:55,840 --> 03:26:59,680
and if i want to add an image like it's

03:26:57,680 --> 03:27:02,800
shown here in the card

03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:05,359
i could just put it in here

03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:06,800
use the same paddings and specify it

03:27:05,359 --> 03:27:10,960
over here

03:27:06,800 --> 03:27:10,960
and improve my component even more

03:27:12,640 --> 03:27:16,720
and then the process only by applying

03:27:14,479 --> 03:27:18,560
all these specifications i found in the

03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:20,080
documentation in the human interface

03:27:18,560 --> 03:27:22,000
guideline

03:27:20,080 --> 03:27:23,600
my component got much prettier and more

03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:25,840
usable as well

03:27:23,600 --> 03:27:28,880
so especially applying the paddings

03:27:25,840 --> 03:27:31,920
makes it much better

03:27:28,880 --> 03:27:33,920
of course i could do all this too if the

03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:36,960
documentation doesn't provide it

03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:38,880
i could take a screenshot open my

03:27:36,960 --> 03:27:40,160
drawing application and start measuring

03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:44,239
everything

03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:47,840
it would take me hours and hours and

03:27:44,239 --> 03:27:51,359
um i would have to make a lot of guesses

03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:52,720
is it more important that the button has

03:27:51,359 --> 03:27:54,800
the width of

03:27:52,720 --> 03:27:56,000
60 pixels or is it more important that

03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:59,760
the padding is 16

03:27:56,000 --> 03:28:02,800
pixels or what happens if i

03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:05,439
um if the title gets too long is it

03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:06,560
going do i have to light it or is it

03:28:05,439 --> 03:28:10,000
just cut off

03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:13,040
is my pop button growing um i have to

03:28:10,000 --> 03:28:13,040
make a lot of guesses

03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:18,160
what are the important areas what what

03:28:16,319 --> 03:28:19,760
did the designers or

03:28:18,160 --> 03:28:25,840
says the writers of the human interface

03:28:19,760 --> 03:28:25,840
guidelines aim for

03:28:26,080 --> 03:28:29,840
that you can take all these

03:28:28,439 --> 03:28:31,680
specifications

03:28:29,840 --> 03:28:33,040
directly from the material design

03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:36,560
guidelines makes it so much

03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:38,080
faster and easier to design

03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:40,479
and it helps you not to forget some

03:28:38,080 --> 03:28:45,040
things like a padding or

03:28:40,479 --> 03:28:45,040
um size or whatever

03:28:47,920 --> 03:28:51,359
it's the same with um

03:28:52,610 --> 03:28:59,520
[Music]

03:28:55,359 --> 03:29:03,359
so if i want to have a title in my

03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:07,520
control i could just copy the font files

03:29:03,359 --> 03:29:11,040
from the card that's something that uh

03:29:07,520 --> 03:29:13,040
all the we are in the kde human

03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:15,439
interface guidelines are missing a lot

03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:16,479
we don't have a lot of details in our

03:29:15,439 --> 03:29:18,800
stuff so

03:29:16,479 --> 03:29:19,600
it's hard to recreate them or to create

03:29:18,800 --> 03:29:21,600
them again

03:29:19,600 --> 03:29:23,520
and we actually did recreate a lot

03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:26,399
because we had to create

03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:28,479
components in qml that already existed

03:29:26,399 --> 03:29:35,840
in

03:29:28,479 --> 03:29:35,840
cued widgets

03:29:40,800 --> 03:29:43,920
okay i'm just i'm sorry i'm talking so

03:29:43,520 --> 03:29:46,840
fast

03:29:43,920 --> 03:29:49,840
i'm pretty much through my presentation

03:29:46,840 --> 03:29:49,840
already

03:30:05,279 --> 03:30:11,359
so just sum it up

03:30:09,439 --> 03:30:14,399
human interface guideline give more

03:30:11,359 --> 03:30:16,479
consistencies for an ecosystem

03:30:14,399 --> 03:30:17,439
in design they give more consistency in

03:30:16,479 --> 03:30:19,120
the inter

03:30:17,439 --> 03:30:20,800
actions and to speed up design and

03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:21,760
development for example by giving

03:30:20,800 --> 03:30:23,520
standards

03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:26,000
standardized solutions for common

03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:26,000
problems

03:30:26,319 --> 03:30:30,080
luckily i see there are a lot of

03:30:27,760 --> 03:30:32,479
questions already in the

03:30:30,080 --> 03:30:32,479
nodes

03:30:35,520 --> 03:30:39,359
today all desktops have their own human

03:30:37,359 --> 03:30:41,279
interface guidelines as they should

03:30:39,359 --> 03:30:42,960
but for a developer developers coming

03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:44,880
into the app ecosystem would it be

03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:46,560
possible to have a minimum set of human

03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:51,040
interface guidelines for the app

03:30:46,560 --> 03:30:51,040
ecosystem without having to choose one

03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:59,840
i think i don't quite understand the

03:30:56,840 --> 03:30:59,840
question

03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:08,399
so you choose the ecosystem you want to

03:31:07,200 --> 03:31:11,680
develop for

03:31:08,399 --> 03:31:13,439
it typically comes along with a human

03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:16,920
interface guideline

03:31:13,439 --> 03:31:20,030
so i don't know what you don't want to

03:31:16,920 --> 03:31:20,030
[Music]

03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:27,840
choose

03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:37,680
[Music]

03:31:39,520 --> 03:31:43,359
hello uh would you like me to read the

03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:47,200
questions for you

03:31:43,359 --> 03:31:47,840
or you okay i i can i can read them too

03:31:47,200 --> 03:31:51,600
but yeah

03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:55,520
i'm fine with you reading them okay

03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:58,319
so again you're welcome to read them

03:31:55,520 --> 03:31:59,840
okay have you um so um would you like me

03:31:58,319 --> 03:32:02,399
to take from the first question or you

03:31:59,840 --> 03:32:02,399
want me to

03:32:02,479 --> 03:32:06,840
tell me i'm going to be taking the first

03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:09,840
question have you attempted any of the

03:32:06,840 --> 03:32:09,840
questions

03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:23,840
okay um can you hear me i think my can

03:32:16,560 --> 03:32:23,840
you hear me

03:32:25,680 --> 03:32:29,439
hello can you hear me yes i can hear you

03:32:28,640 --> 03:32:33,760
okay chris

03:32:29,439 --> 03:32:34,880
uh um sorry i'm having some issues with

03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:38,640
my

03:32:34,880 --> 03:32:38,640
mic um one minute

03:32:42,399 --> 03:32:45,439
okay so the second question um do you

03:32:44,319 --> 03:32:48,000
think designers

03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:49,439
from the various desktop projects will

03:32:48,000 --> 03:32:52,880
be able to collectively

03:32:49,439 --> 03:32:55,359
exchange ideas in a space um

03:32:52,880 --> 03:32:59,040
like last or specific forum for

03:32:55,359 --> 03:32:59,040
designers on the linux platform

03:33:02,160 --> 03:33:07,439
yes i think so would but um at least for

03:33:10,720 --> 03:33:14,720
um there are not so many designers

03:33:13,760 --> 03:33:16,880
because our

03:33:14,720 --> 03:33:18,880
approach to human interface guidelines

03:33:16,880 --> 03:33:22,560
is not directed from the

03:33:18,880 --> 03:33:24,239
top to rather but there's not a

03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:26,080
group that creates a human interface

03:33:24,239 --> 03:33:30,080
guidelines and every one

03:33:26,080 --> 03:33:34,090
has to follow it but it's more a process

03:33:30,080 --> 03:33:35,680
of documenting the actual development

03:33:34,090 --> 03:33:40,080
[Music]

03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:42,239
and designers i talked mostly in the

03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:43,920
presentation are designers for

03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:45,760
applications not for the

03:33:43,920 --> 03:33:49,600
um not to write a human interface

03:33:45,760 --> 03:33:52,640
guidelines because um

03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:55,680
most designers are not you are no

03:33:52,640 --> 03:33:56,720
user interface or user or user

03:33:55,680 --> 03:34:02,640
experience

03:33:56,720 --> 03:34:02,640
experts either but of course um

03:34:02,800 --> 03:34:06,960
there could be a lot more collaboration

03:34:04,640 --> 03:34:12,319
between the desktops

03:34:06,960 --> 03:34:14,320
and a lot of exchange of ideas

03:34:12,319 --> 03:34:15,520
and i think uh something like a

03:34:14,320 --> 03:34:17,760
[Music]

03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:19,680
conference would work best especially

03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:21,920
for design is uh

03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:23,359
in my opinion very important to have

03:34:21,920 --> 03:34:29,279
personal face-to-face

03:34:23,359 --> 03:34:31,520
uh exchanges

03:34:29,279 --> 03:34:32,560
okay um thank you so much um there's a

03:34:31,520 --> 03:34:35,040
third question

03:34:32,560 --> 03:34:36,560
say them are there any lego restrictions

03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:40,800
with regard to

03:34:36,560 --> 03:34:43,200
using material design outside android

03:34:40,800 --> 03:34:45,279
not as far as i know but i'm not a legal

03:34:43,200 --> 03:34:48,399
expert

03:34:45,279 --> 03:34:49,120
okay there's very many other projects

03:34:48,399 --> 03:34:56,239
that use

03:34:49,120 --> 03:34:58,319
material design

03:34:56,239 --> 03:35:00,319
um okay so we still have more questions

03:34:58,319 --> 03:35:03,520
coming up for you but then i'll go to

03:35:00,319 --> 03:35:05,840
the fourth question how do you suggest

03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:07,439
we approach conversation between desktop

03:35:05,840 --> 03:35:09,680
and mobile and

03:35:07,439 --> 03:35:12,399
um applications that are developed to

03:35:09,680 --> 03:35:12,399
work on both

03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:20,380
um like i said in the beginning of my

03:35:18,239 --> 03:35:22,960
talk i'm much more in

03:35:20,380 --> 03:35:25,760
[Music]

03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:26,800
writing and rupturing the app the

03:35:25,760 --> 03:35:30,479
content and

03:35:26,800 --> 03:35:33,040
providing um images and

03:35:30,479 --> 03:35:33,840
videos and stuff like this and actually

03:35:33,040 --> 03:35:36,160
creating

03:35:33,840 --> 03:35:37,120
a user interface patterns or design

03:35:36,160 --> 03:35:41,279
patterns

03:35:37,120 --> 03:35:45,120
so i think you have to ask someone else

03:35:41,279 --> 03:35:48,720
who is more expert in this area than me

03:35:45,120 --> 03:35:50,960
okay um can i take the fifth question it

03:35:48,720 --> 03:35:50,960
says

03:35:51,200 --> 03:35:54,720
i g s for vr

03:35:54,960 --> 03:36:01,760
um yes okay uh for example microsoft

03:35:58,560 --> 03:36:05,040
uh universal um

03:36:01,760 --> 03:36:09,200
universal platform uvp

03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:09,200
windows platform covers um

03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:17,120
although we are at least they try to

03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:22,319
that's what they say in their

03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:22,319
in here it's um in their

03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:25,359
documentation

03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:30,080
okay so we have someone trying to

03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:33,120
quickly

03:36:30,080 --> 03:36:35,760
wrap uh get a question

03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:36,720
so it says and does microsoft hig cover

03:36:35,760 --> 03:36:40,399
vr

03:36:36,720 --> 03:36:45,520
slash error for ulu lens and then

03:36:40,399 --> 03:36:45,520
or other devices too i don't know

03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:50,399
i guess other human interface guidelines

03:36:49,680 --> 03:36:53,760
for

03:36:50,399 --> 03:36:57,279
other vr stuff like uh

03:36:53,760 --> 03:37:00,800
from steam or

03:36:57,279 --> 03:37:04,239
uh i don't know but so tons of human

03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:07,920
interface guidelines out on the web

03:37:04,239 --> 03:37:10,960
yeah um thank you so much uh fabrian um

03:37:07,920 --> 03:37:13,600
great talk on woman interface guidelines

03:37:10,960 --> 03:37:15,040
um if anyone would like to continue the

03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:16,319
conversation there's a great

03:37:15,040 --> 03:37:20,000
conversation in the chat

03:37:16,319 --> 03:37:23,120
and you can reach him out as well um

03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:24,880
if you have any further questions um

03:37:23,120 --> 03:37:26,800
thank you once again it was great to

03:37:24,880 --> 03:37:30,080
have you on the talk um

03:37:26,800 --> 03:37:31,040
i really enjoyed your talk very we are

03:37:30,080 --> 03:37:34,399
taking the

03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:40,080
presenter from you right now and we

03:37:34,399 --> 03:37:40,080
are going to be going on a break

03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:45,840
um

03:37:46,160 --> 03:37:52,880
so we're going to be going on um

03:37:49,359 --> 03:37:59,840
a break to be coming back

03:37:52,880 --> 03:38:02,080
for the pub quiz

03:37:59,840 --> 03:38:03,120
so for the meantime once again you might

03:38:02,080 --> 03:38:05,760
um have to

03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:06,479
stretch your legs take some tea or

03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:09,359
possibly

03:38:06,479 --> 03:38:10,560
um continue the conversation and the

03:38:09,359 --> 03:38:14,000
public chat which is um

03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:15,840
quite interesting in a way so i'm going

03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:17,120
to be handing it over to allison now to

03:38:15,840 --> 03:38:19,600
continue

03:38:17,120 --> 03:38:19,600
alison

03:38:24,800 --> 03:38:29,279
i don't think alison is here but now

03:38:26,720 --> 03:38:32,479
what we have to do is the

03:38:29,279 --> 03:38:37,279
closing because this was the last talk

03:38:32,479 --> 03:38:40,160
of lias right oh yeah great

03:38:37,279 --> 03:38:41,060
okay let me show myself uh neil are you

03:38:40,160 --> 03:38:44,080
around here

03:38:41,060 --> 03:38:48,239
[Music]

03:38:44,080 --> 03:38:55,840
hello all right let's see if i can

03:38:48,239 --> 03:38:55,840
get my webcam on

03:39:00,239 --> 03:39:06,640
ah i knew

03:39:03,279 --> 03:39:10,319
nice seeing you you too you too

03:39:06,640 --> 03:39:13,600
well uh 2020 and we managed to

03:39:10,319 --> 03:39:16,880
do another lis great stuff right

03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:17,760
yeah absolutely it's um it's been an

03:39:16,880 --> 03:39:21,439
interesting year

03:39:17,760 --> 03:39:24,000
shall we say um so i'm just

03:39:21,439 --> 03:39:24,720
really glad that uh everyone managed to

03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:28,080
come along and

03:39:24,720 --> 03:39:30,080
um carry on talking about apps on

03:39:28,080 --> 03:39:32,000
on linux and how we carry on driving

03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:33,840
that forward

03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:36,399
yeah i think that we've had great

03:39:33,840 --> 03:39:38,399
contents we've had

03:39:36,399 --> 03:39:39,680
well good conversations obviously it's

03:39:38,399 --> 03:39:41,600
not the same as

03:39:39,680 --> 03:39:43,600
well last year where we got to do it

03:39:41,600 --> 03:39:47,840
around a beer but

03:39:43,600 --> 03:39:51,199
we went to the amalfi coast so there's a

03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:52,640
absolutely um

03:39:51,199 --> 03:39:54,720
some interesting themes this year as

03:39:52,640 --> 03:39:57,359
well so

03:39:54,720 --> 03:39:59,120
fair amount more around how we can

03:39:57,359 --> 03:40:02,560
basically

03:39:59,120 --> 03:40:05,439
make sure that app authors can

03:40:02,560 --> 03:40:07,600
even free software app authors um can

03:40:05,439 --> 03:40:09,439
basically get money out of

03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:11,760
what they do for linux as well that's

03:40:09,439 --> 03:40:14,640
something i haven't really kind of seen

03:40:11,760 --> 03:40:15,520
highlighted too much before um is

03:40:14,640 --> 03:40:19,040
anything new

03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:21,920
you kind of saw around there alexis

03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:22,880
yeah well that's what we were after as

03:40:21,920 --> 03:40:25,680
well right

03:40:22,880 --> 03:40:28,000
we want uh las to be the place where

03:40:25,680 --> 03:40:31,120
these things can become a reality and

03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:34,000
i think that indeed we saw a lot of that

03:40:31,120 --> 03:40:34,800
we've been seeing also more talks about

03:40:34,000 --> 03:40:36,479
uh

03:40:34,800 --> 03:40:38,960
topics beyond the actual obvious

03:40:36,479 --> 03:40:41,520
technical topics right which

03:40:38,960 --> 03:40:42,640
uh i mean they're interested interesting

03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:45,120
because we're

03:40:42,640 --> 03:40:47,040
technologists all of us but we all know

03:40:45,120 --> 03:40:50,880
that these products are

03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:54,080
go far beyond from to the zeros and ones

03:40:50,880 --> 03:40:57,920
that we're so accustomed with

03:40:54,080 --> 03:41:00,319
um i just realized uh we didn't

03:40:57,920 --> 03:41:01,680
introduce ourselves maybe it's it's

03:41:00,319 --> 03:41:05,120
worth doing

03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:05,760
um i am alesh i am the president of the

03:41:05,120 --> 03:41:08,319
kdv

03:41:05,760 --> 03:41:09,359
one of the organizations that is

03:41:08,319 --> 03:41:12,800
organizing the
