00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,510
apps on how to distribute the apps and

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,100

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:12,470
go naturally I think the setup is good

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,580
to me and I mean the size is already but

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,350
it's such an interesting topic

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:21,350
I think we're constantly working on

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,180
including the number of audience okay so

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,810
can you help me with the topic of your

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,470
talk yes I gave a talk about a small

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:33,560
experiment using an open-source desktop

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,840
and this was mail client and sometimes I

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,869
think can I also make my own mail client

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,720
and learning a new programming language

00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:44,869
for us I thought let's try to make a

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,439
small email client in trust and I did I

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,900
wrote about that and turned out to be to

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,930
be a lot of fun the software worked very

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,530
fast and great considering the wall I

00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,250
was that I put in and that's what I talk

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,200
about

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,050
before had to be very fast five minutes

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,970
and in the end yeah I didn't have

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,590
exactly the right amount of time to also

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,930
do small town it was I faked the message

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,050

creating my own mail title run I do that

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,560
after this okay so any message that

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,740
