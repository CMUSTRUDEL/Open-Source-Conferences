00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,099
audience please sure

00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:15,679
I am Camilla I'm a software engineer at

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,930
the next talk I develop at the

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,619
disappoint and this your first time in

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,619
Barcelona

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,720
really nice people really friendly love

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:38,440
people's it's really cheap to compare to

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:38,440
other provinces to start go sites and

00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:45,430
can you tell me about the event so far

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,430
is any topic is there at all

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:54,890
so I really enjoy catching up on what's

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,520
happening with what's going on with snap

00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,820
and flat-pack there are a lot of talks

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,479
about it about how to snap up your

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,270
vacation how flat to fight words I was

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:13,070
really lucky knowledge so that was very

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:16,670
interesting but I I also noticed that

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:20,950
there were not that many talks are

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,619
talking about expert with a more general

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:31,039
overview about the Linux desktop

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:34,729
situation the more yeah I feel what we

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:36,500
heard from work oh and from front they

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,850
took notes that we had Monday and

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:44,320
Tuesday they gave a more generic in this

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,270
overview about the Linux desktop

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,460
[Music]

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:54,049
economics and the value of the things we

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:58,560
do and devour and Frank talk kind of T

00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:03,000
smart about what we have to do

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:08,190
and get more users to know move from

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,770
Windows or Mac OS to use deluxe so

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,760
that's maybe that next year which

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,680
improve to have more tops like there

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,600
will give more of this perspective what

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,320
we are doing wrong with hurricane proof

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,190
to get more new Linux users not just

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:30,180
about the technical technicalities of

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:37,010
packaging applications and also maybe

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:37,010
having one more day of discussions like

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,220
did you tend the last 22

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:04,890
well I will you would hope to see big

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,050
change happening after the conference at

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,269
least all the things we heard that you

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,459
need to improve our you'd like to see

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,640
that this continues you know that you

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,459
will get actionable items to do and that

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,410
we read that next year hopefully we have

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,840
the conference again and that we see the

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,940
things actually changing you know

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,989
modernize things I really like to see is

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,380
KDE and you know collaborating more on

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:34,380
the sense of not necessarily as it was

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,090
say to one of the talks to version that

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,010
is very hard to do but I think they

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,930
should be talking more and how to get

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,670
more users and how to create better

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,049
documentation so people can court the

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:51,420
applications to the Linux desktop and

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,269
how to get Adobe Microsoft interested in

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,239
heavier applications written actually

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:03,900
using our power frameworks that killed

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:06,470
educate instead of elastic JavaScript as

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,470
they are using

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,860
there's a lot that we can actually

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,790
improve on for the coming year and I

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,889
just want to say thank you and a big

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,459
thank you to everybody else bye for now

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,459
thank you

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,250
