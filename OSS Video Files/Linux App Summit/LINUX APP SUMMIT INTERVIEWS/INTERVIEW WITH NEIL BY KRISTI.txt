hello everyone today I'll be

00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,860
interviewing Neil McGovern hello Neil

00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:13,080
thank you other is this your first time

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,400
in Brasilia and how do you find the city

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,020
no so I might beat a couple of times

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,269
normally passing through you though so I

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,000
think I came through here when we had

00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,039
dead contain the extra Mederma region of

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,570
Spain so we we took a bit of a road trip

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,189
there and drove through so spent a

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,509
couple of days but it's kind of the

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,079
first time I've come from a conference

00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,550
and was really able to enjoy this it's I

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,340
always loved Barcelona it's a it's a

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,190
beautiful city with fantastic food and

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,140
great people and also for me living in

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:49,530
the UK really easy to get into itself so

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,090
it's always fun to come along absolutely

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,079
yeah

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,820
then accept some it is something that

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,469
obviously with the foundation would be

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:05,210
doing for this our third year now I

00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:09,030
think it's a really important event for

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,730
not only genome but the wider free

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,450
software communities and the ability to

00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,280
put to promote free software on the

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,700
desktop and those use of readers of the

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,410
desktop there's be the one thing I was

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,960
particularly pleased on this year is

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:30,210
there's been a real focus on growing the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,050
the program the app ecosystem rather

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,900
than just what we next doing the desktop

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:42,560
or how we're going to be compete because

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:46,980
for users to move to a free software

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,420
desktop and that means that think and

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,340
then getting power to use their own

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,140
computing there really needs to be a

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,430
compelling case of having those apps

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,899
they require to do their everyday work

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,570
to access that and so it's been really

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:07,450
good to see everyone from ad you know

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,220
elementary people throughout the it's a

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,410
wider free software community sort of

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,750
coming together and recognizing this is

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,890
a problem and trying to work together to

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,110
to solve it

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,599
and so that's been particularly good to

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,819
see this right thank you very much for

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,530
the feedback and do you think that there

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,870
is something that we should improve for

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,620
the next year or that we can include in

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,640
the conference

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,430
what's the comments to advise us yeah

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,440
suddenly this stage super happy to to

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,120
and hopeful that that we we continue

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:45,610
this next year as well and that we do

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:47,349
more again I think basically broadening

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,540
our base again and trying to get more

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:52,239
ideas for more people would be fantastic

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,870
this has been the first year that it's

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,579
it's been both you know KD which is

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,560
previously no in the past being able to

00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:05,459
get people along who wouldn't

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,280
traditionally come to a gnome or KDE

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,420
conference I think is really important

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,130
growing beyond what we traditionally

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,049
have is our desktop and wider ecosystem

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,840
is I think really important try and get

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:24,480
try and get that broad range of great

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,300
thank you very much for the comments

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,459
thank you all see you soon

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,459
