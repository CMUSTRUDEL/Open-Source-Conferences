if i do a pre-recorded talk i really

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,640

and i'll do my best to answer them

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
so i i'm going to tell you just a tiny

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
bit about myself

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,000
many of you already know me um my name

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,680
is

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,800
karen sandler and

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,560
i am really interested in software

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
freedom for a variety of issues but one

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,160
of those things

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
and i was talking about this in the the

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
chat just a moment ago

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,480
is that i have a big heart

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,600
i have um oh okay

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
so oh trying to turn down b suggests

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,720
turning down my uh my gain a little bit

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,720
so i will do that

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
how's that is that a little bit better

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
i'll just keep continuing and we can

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,519
adjust as we go um

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,040
so uh so i have a

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,760
i have a big heart i have a heart

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
condition it's called hypertrophic

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,519
cardiomyopathy

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
and that means that my heart is

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
literally thicker than a normal person's

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,760
heart and i have

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,920
it means that when it when it it beats

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
it sort of beats a little bit less

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,560
efficiently and

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
this is generally not a problem but i

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,040
have a

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,279
very high risk of suddenly dying um

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
and uh that's the medical term that they

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,040
use is called sudden death

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,959
and um so i have a pacemaker

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,000
defibrillator implanted

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,720
um right in my chest and it

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
uh it's it's screwed into my heart with

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
a wire

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
and it monitors my heart and if i get

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
into a dangerous rhythm

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
then it um it shocks me and this is

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,920
actually a picture of

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,360
my old defibrillator that used to be in

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,320
my body and you can see that there's

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
like a little

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
uh like dents and scratches which i

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,920
think is when they pried it out

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,279
um i think it's really cool to to be

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,160
able to see the stuff that

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,480
that was once a part of me and so uh you

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
know

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,839
getting this defibrillator because i've

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
given talks about this before and i

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
won't talk about it for too long here

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
but it caused me to reevaluate the

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,079
technology that we rely on and my own

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,120
technology

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,839
um and uh and instead of uh of

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
feeling um you know a little bit

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,800
helpless from the whole procedure i feel

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
like is a very

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
empowering thing and so i think like to

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,240
think of myself as a as a cyborg

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,160
and um and i'm a a lawyer as well

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,000
um and uh and so i like to think of

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
myself as a cyborg lawyer which is in a

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,120
way quite terrifying

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,959
and and i basically

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
through that whole experience i became

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,480
very passionate about software freedom

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,920
i once upon a time was lawyer to

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,440
lots and lots of free and open source

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,560
software projects

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,600
and that included both gnome and

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,720
kde so

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
so that was pretty cool there's a

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,320
question of why does it have two serial

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,320
codes um

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
and it's that one is the model number

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
and one is the serial code

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
um so yeah so we were putting questions

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,040
in

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,600
the public chat now that i'll respond to

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,200
and we can go to the shared notes later

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,560
and after after the talk is over um

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,959
so so all of this

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
caused me to believe that software

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,360
transparency was really important and we

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
needed to

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
be able to audit our code when um when i

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
i have an engineering background

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
and um and then became a lawyer and not

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,760
being able to see the source code of my

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,440
own body was quite

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,000
upsetting and so um

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,920
that caused me to be a real uh real

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
advocate for software freedom and

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,040
gave me the opportunity to advocate for

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
gnome another free and open source

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
software project

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,200
um in that way and i thought that it was

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,079
all about transparency and then when i

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,399
i was pregnant i got shocked

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
unnecessarily by my defibrillator

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,600
um because my heart was palpitating

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,399
which is super normal for

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
um for pregnant women it's about a

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,560
quarter to a third of all women they

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,199
think have

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,680
they estimate have palpitations and so

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,079
um

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,920
and so because my heart was palpitating

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,600
but i had a defibrillator it thought

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,079
that my heart was in a dangerous rhythm

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,480
and it

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,600
it shocked me um even though i didn't

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
need to be shocked

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,639
and uh and the only way for me to stop

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
my defibrillator from giving me

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
unnecessary treatment was to take

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
drugs that slowed my heart rate down so

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,680
much so that i had a hard time walking

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,680
up a flight of stairs

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,360
and it was like really hard to um

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,199
to get my head around when this happened

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
and you know it was a little bit

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,040
upsetting but but ultimately it worked

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
out okay because

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,399
the drugs were fine i managed to you

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
know i

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,760
i had the baby and everything was fine

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
and um but i

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,440
i it really was very um

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
a very interesting experience because

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,000
what

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,320
i learned from it is that even though

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
everybody involved in the process had

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
the best of intentions

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,480
right even though everybody who worked

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,519
at the medical device manufacturer

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,760
and um and

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
uh and all of the medical technicians

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,440
and the doctors

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,519
all wanted to help me and provide me

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,680
with life-saving technology

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
my use case was not a use case that was

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,920
anticipated

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,440
by the manufacturers because a very

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,279
small number of people at any given time

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
are pregnant and have defibrillators

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,600
only 15 percent of defibrillators go to

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
people under the age of 65.

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
so uh when i raised this to my um to

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
like the head of

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,160
high-risk uh obstetrics where i at my

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,680
hospital where i gave birth

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,880
um she said i've never i've never

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,519
and you know i've i've only uh once

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
had a patient with a defibrillator i've

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,480
had pacemaker to favor

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
pacemaker patients but not defibrillator

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,160
patients anyway so

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,680
um so it really stood for this

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,120
proposition of like well there are going

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
to be lots of use cases that the

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
manufacturers don't anticipate

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,399
even if everyone has the best of

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
intentions and the only way that we will

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
be able to

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,720
have technology that we rely on over

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
time

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,920
is by making sure that it's free and

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
open and that we have control over it as

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,839
a

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,680
as a society and have the ability to

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,199
have collective

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,240
action so um

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,040
that's um that's a uh

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,639
you know it was a really defining moment

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
for me and it really

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,639
changed the the lens for me of how i

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,040
view software freedom and so

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,279
um i think of software freedom as a

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,800
deeply personal issue

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,680
and even though we rely often

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,320
on collective action in order to make

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,720
sure that like to take advantage of

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
software freedom especially for folks

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,240
that are not developers

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,240
um the the ideas behind software freedom

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
and making sure that our technology is

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
safe for us to rely on our deeply

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,079
intertwined

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,199
um and so that's sort of i wanted to

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
just give you that introduction so you

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,040
can

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,839
understand where i'm coming from and how

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,160
i see the whole software freedom

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,079
movement so um

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
and incidentally that picture was taken

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,920
at aquatic

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,199
and all this to say so now we're this is

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,920
many years later and

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,560
we are in a pandemic and i miss all of

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,480
you

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
um i just want to start that i was

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,919
looking down this list of names and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,199
there are so many people who

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:14,240
i care so deeply about and i miss you

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
i i also miss those of you who i don't

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,919
know

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,880
because as someone who is trying to

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,760
advocate

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
for a better for better technology for a

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
better society

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,640
for um you know for for things to

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,760
improve

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,880
i i i can't do that alone i'm only i'm

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,520
only one advocate

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
and so much has happened over the last

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,799
year

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,919
and i look forward to conferences and

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,679
interactions

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,440
to reset to reset myself and also to

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,280
hear what all of you think so i can

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
learn and so that we can better function

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,000
as a movement

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,360
and so i i i really can't underscore

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,480
how much i miss seeing all of you

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,039
and talking to you um

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,000
so uh and and and thinking about that

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,720
and thinking about how

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
special this conference is and how it

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,520
comes out of

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,120
you know it's it's such a collaborative

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,559
process it made me think of this

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,760
conference and if anybody

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,679
can post in a public chat if they know

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
if they can guess what conference this

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
is

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,200
and i'd be curious to see if anyone

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,960
could uh could guess it

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
so i'll just leave it for just a second

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
longer so that people could figure it

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,919
out

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,840
and i'm curious if anyone's gonna gonna

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,600
guess it

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,720
okay all right so we're going to move on

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
to the next slide

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,559
but i'll keep putting our guesses in and

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,600
i'll let you know

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,840
later on if anyone gets it right

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,559
okay um so you know we rely on

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,200
conferences

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,600
a lot um uh

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,280
in order to reset our remote communities

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
because we're all working around the

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
world

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,400
and and of course we're

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,720
you know no one was better prepared

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
for a pandemic in a way than we were in

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,520
terms of the remote nature of

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,640
of of avoiding other people in person

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,960
like we were

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,440
very well situated to um

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,880
uh we were very well situated to deal

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
with uh with working from home

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,559
almost all of us that i i and again

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
looking at the list of names on the side

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,559
those of you who i know

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
almost all of you were uh or a very high

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,440
percentage of you were already working

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,679
from uh from home before the

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,559
the pandemic already happened and

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
conservancy

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,919
which is the organization that i worked

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,400
for the software freedom conservancy

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,000
we are a charitable nonprofit that um

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,760
that is a fiscal sponsor and so we've

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,200
got around 50 member projects

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,840
and we're also known for working on um

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,240
defending the gpl and enforcing copyleft

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,840
and

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,520
um also for our um our project

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
member project outreachy which i will

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,400
i'll talk about in a little bit too

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
um so uh so we at conservancy were

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,799
already a remote organization

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
but um but not going to conferences was

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,840
uh

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
was really a a change and not being able

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
to

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,559
uh to see people um

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,159
luna mentions that um that it is all it

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
is always better to see people online

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,960
than not at all and i think

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,600
that is exactly right and that is why

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,280
we are we are here today because even

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,679
though we can't be in person

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,919
and it's not the same it's still really

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,039
important for us to get together and

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,760
um and share our ideas um and

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,200
and sync up and i i should just i went

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,240
forward on the slide so i'm gonna have

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
to go back again

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,080
but um but this picture is a uh

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,600
it's a photo i found that's marked in

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,559
public domain where it's a doll

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,559
it looks like the doll's working

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,840
remotely it looks like the doll has a

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,760
keyboard but when you look a little

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,000
closer it's actually a television remote

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
which

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
i really astounded me when i i noticed

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,280
that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,520
um so the um

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
the upside to this the huge win was that

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,400
we were ready to deal with this kind of

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,400
situation

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,000
we know how to communicate with each

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
other from afar we know how to

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,600
communicate

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,440
asynchronously and we know how to

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,960
communicate synchronously

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,720
um when um you know using various

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,520
online communication tools and we had

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,600
a lot of tools going into this that we

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,440
had already developed and relied on and

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,000
worked into our communities

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
before the pandemic so this is one of

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,480
those situations

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,480
where we are so

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
like we we we were we were so ahead of

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,919
the curve both in understanding what it

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,720
means to work remotely

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,039
and um and how to gather people together

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,280
to

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,080
discuss important issues remotely but

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120
also

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,240
we were ready technologically with the

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,840
tools that

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,280
um that would help us um uh to

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,640
to do that with software freedom but

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,240
unfortunately that the fact that we had

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
these tools and that they were really

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,240
good

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,000
did not help us to spread the use of

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,159
those tools generally

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,559
the um i think

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,280
i can do a poll can i do a pull

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,280
yes i can

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,960
i'm going to set up a really super quick

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,960
poll

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,600
no i think i i set up an accidental

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,400
instead of an actual accidental yes or

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,320
no poll

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,960
i think which uh failed anyway

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
i i guess just uh i was just looking for

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,400
a yes or no for people who

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,559
um people who knew

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
who have friends and relatives who

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,400
started using

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,200
teleconferencing or other remote tools

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
that had not

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,520
used it before i would guess it's

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,480
actually uh oh i did a yes no yeah

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,840
okay yes yes i was wondering if uh oh

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
yeah okay so people are saying yes they

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,880
didn't know

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
probably almost everybody here has

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
someone or many people

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,159
who had never produced any of these

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,200
remote tools and

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,480
and started using them and i was so you

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,679
know we were all

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,960
in a we were all in a negative emotional

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,280
state when the pandemic

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
started of course um there were very

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,159
serious issues and there have been very

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,280
serious issues both

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,919
uh both related directly to um to covet

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
but also to a lot of political

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,640
situations throughout the world during

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,080
this time

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
and so it's been an extremely stressful

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
time in a variety of ways but at the

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
beginning of the pandemic part of me was

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
thinking

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,039
well at least this is a great

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,919
opportunity for us to be able to get

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,000
people to use

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
the tools that we have started to work

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,559
on and it was

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,279
it was in a way exciting but at the same

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,840
time

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,520
they what what really happened is that

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,799
people jumped on the proprietary tools

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
that were already there

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,240
um many people who had never heard of

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,480
zoom before

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,080
started talking about zoom zoom fatigue

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,120
as if they had using zoom their whole

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
lives it was

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,720
uh you know really really fascinating um

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,000
you know a parent group at my kids

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,600
school

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,320
they they set up a a a slack

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,679
um you know room and they were

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,279
encouraging people to join

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,559
and um and even though i suggested we

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,039
use

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,039
one of the other solutions instead and

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,400
set it up and made it available

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,240
um i did not somehow

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,440
do that in a way that was effective

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,960
enough that people felt like they would

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,640
adopt it they all used

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,320
these proprietary tools that had been

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
standing around and that that

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,919
were also functioning at the same time

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,200
even though many of them

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,799
had a very steep learning curve for the

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,080
proprietary tools and

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,240
um and which would have been similar to

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,200
the free and open source software tools

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,880
and so it was

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,039
extremely disappointing because the

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
ability to have people come onto you are

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,400
solutions that could have been

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,039
customizable that could have had

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
so many more um you know could have had

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,760
follow-on effects for investment in the

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,000
technology

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,000
didn't really materialize and so one of

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,039
the deep disappointments of the pandemic

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,240
is that folks began to understand a

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,000
little bit more about

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
our lives the way we collaborate and the

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
way we conduct our communities all

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
around the world

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,919
but at the same time we fail to bring

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,760
our solutions and we fail to i mean

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,159
we did in some ways and i'll get to that

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
too so i don't want to be too negative

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,559
but but you know negotiating these power

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,559
dynamics is really really hard

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,400
you know when people are under deep

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,960
stress it's very difficult

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,000
to say well i know you want to talk to

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
someone and they want to

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,039
you know i know you want to talk to me

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,960
and you want to use zoom but

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,320
can you use will you use jitsi will you

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,799
use big blue button can we

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
can we talk about that and what i found

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,000
was that

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,520
you have to really evaluate where what

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
the power dynamic is

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,559
and where you stand on that how can you

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
be

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,559
cons you know how can you be considerate

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,279
of other people's

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,760
mental state and their needs while also

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,960
being

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,799
a zealous advocate being a a really

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
persuasive advocate and

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,559
being appropriately uncompromising and

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,799
this is really really difficult

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,600
um you know an example of what i found

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,760
for example

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:24,080
is that like um here's a good one so my

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,960
um my one of my children

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,919
takes violent lessons and the violin

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,919
teacher

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
suggested a proprietary tool i think it

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,640
was facetime

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,039
but because i pay that teacher

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,880
for lessons i was it was very easy for

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,679
me to say okay this is a situation

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
i have control over this situation so

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,159
i'm going to

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,120
um i'm going to ask to move it to

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,640
a free solution even though it's a

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,080
little bit of an inconvenience and i can

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
offer to pay for that time

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,600
that if there's any learning time and it

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
turns out this you know

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,520
uh i think that one was jitsie jizzy is

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,360
so easy you know so easy to use and so

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,760
is big blue button there wasn't any time

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
um for trading but the uh the teacher

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,480
appreciated that

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,640
that offer and then it was easy to move

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,840
to that whereas uh an institutional

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,600
decision so

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,640
um i teach a a class at uh columbia law

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
school

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
and they had made the decision to use

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,799
zoom it was uh

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,520
it was a non-starter to try to negotiate

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,080
a cha a move away from that for the

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,000
whole

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,200
uh for for my class within the law

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,279
school um

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,640
and they have a whole structure for uh

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,320
for classes but i could move my

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,200
participation off to the extent that i

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,960
could so i

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,720
made a big blue button room and that's

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
what we used and so you know

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,320
it's it's it's tricky because it's

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,120
alienating to

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,120
run in and say no no no we must use only

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,840
free tools and if you don't you're a bad

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,679
person

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,880
it's not a great way especially to deal

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,240
with people when they're under stress

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
it's a great way to make them never want

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
to work with you ever again

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,600
but at the same time to use every ounce

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
of our power

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,440
in the situation to get people to use

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,720
better tools because by getting people

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,559
to use better tools

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
it will it will improve things in the

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,799
long run for everyone

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,840
and so you know i think it's what we've

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,240
learned is that it

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,679
it it's particularly uh it's

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,520
particularly difficult to negotiate

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,480
these power dynamics and i think that

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,279
um in some ways uh we we failed and one

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,399
of those ways

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,880
was largely in so many conferences that

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,120
were

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
organized for free and open source

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,480
software

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,520
were done um uh were done

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
in um we're done using proprietary

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,640
solutions

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,559
um there was even there were even

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559
conferences that were built as

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,559
as software freedom as free software

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,120
conferences that were using

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,559
proprietary software and for those

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,159
conferences

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,840
you know i think it's really important

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,440
to meet people where they are

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
if people want to use the tools that

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,399
they are going to use and that means

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
that people can hear your message more

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,600
clearly

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,720
then it's worth using them so for

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,640
example

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,240
a conference about ventilators that i

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,080
attended you know

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,679
it it's not you know that's not within

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
the software freedom community

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,039
uh but i could bring the ideas of

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,360
software freedom them that's worth

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,039
engaging with proprietary software um

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,399
for to get people to move away from

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,640
proprietary software

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,000
but conferences that are for for

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,600
software freedom

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,880
is it really a software freedom

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,440
conference if it's not proprietary

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,039
software

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,039
and if all of the attendees have to use

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,520
proprietary software and so

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
um you know i really had to figure out

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
how to

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,559
handle that and um in many situations i

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
recorded a talk that

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,080
using free software that included um

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,039
uh an explanation of why the proprietary

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,480
software was bad

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:44,559
but i was disheartened and upset

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,520
because like how how could it seem

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,200
like how could it be that um that we

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,799
would need to rely on these proprietary

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,320
solutions in order to have

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,600
our conferences even amongst ourselves

00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,039
and so it was really really tough

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,679
um but

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,960
there were some wins in this time and i

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,320
would say that guadac

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,080
last year was one of the first

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,840
conferences that i went to that was

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
a big blue button conference and it went

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,559
remarkably well thanks to the

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,440
sysadmin team and then and just the fact

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,559
that we're meeting

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,679
here using big blue button is a huge

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,080
one and um and really reflects a ton of

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
work

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,120
from the conference organizers so i'm

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,200
you know

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,039
really grateful for that and we have you

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,360
know about 100 people that are all

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,080
um here listening to this talk right now

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,440
live

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,480
and i just you know that is is it's it's

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,760
uh it's it's it's a difficult task task

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,559
and i'm really grateful for the

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,679
organizers

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,039
for for doing that um and

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,919
um and and uh the mo i think the biggest

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,000
software freedom win and conferences

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
over the pandemic so far was fosdem they

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,760
invested an incredible amount of time

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,320
and energy and resources

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,880
in making fosdem online be completely

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,640
free

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,919
and they were wildly successful

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,760
fosdem had i think in total around 40

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,360
000 people participate in it and

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,399
at one time peak attendance was 33

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,080
000 attendees and it was all done using

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,760
a combination of different

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,679
those different tools that i had in the

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,480
previous slide

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,279
they had 25 simultaneously simultaneous

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,840
talks of the same

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
you know like going on at any given time

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,240
um i

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,159
co-organized the legal and policy dev

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,880
room so i just have a screenshot of

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,840
our um of a panel that it was the

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,360
organizers

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,320
from uh that dev room at our peak we had

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,799
almost 300 people just in our own dev

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,919
room

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,519
and it all went completely well and so

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,760
the huge win is that we demonstrated

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,960
that it was possible there are a ton

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,720
of uh of of

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
conferences that are smaller that said

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,039
that they couldn't they couldn't

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,200
possibly handle

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,000
a um using free software to conduct the

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,559
conference

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
but i'm so glad that fosdem demonstrated

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,399
that it could be done on such a

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,760
big scale because now we know that it's

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,840
possible and if we can

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,880
invest the resources we can do it and it

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,279
was great there were

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,960
private rooms where organizers were able

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
to talk to speakers and get them queued

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
up and answer any questions and have

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,399
them ready and then

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,399
there was the ability to invite

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,320
participants at the track into a private

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,080
room to have conversations with speakers

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,240
after their talks so that

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,440
it simulated the hallway track it was

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,679
extremely successful

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,279
and i think was uh was really exciting

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
and i really have to applaud the fosdem

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,600
organizers for doing that because now we

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,000
know

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,320
that it's just a matter of resources and

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,519
that we can invest them

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,679
and uh and have a have a free format

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,360
so i think that was a huge win during

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,039
the pandemic for software freedom

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,640
even though um it's been so

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,440
disappointing over and over again to be

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,679
asked to use proprietary software um and

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,880
i

00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,559
i use this this is a slide of a tweet

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
where um where somebody posted a um a

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,799
news of a german town that was running

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,200
their own um jitsi server

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,360
so that schools and local choir groups

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,960
don't have to rely on skype and zoom

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,880
and there are quite a lot of those small

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,720
stories like that folks that are

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,559
schools that are using big blue button

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,559
um uh

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
governments that are local governments

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,760
that were making

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,200
jitsi and big blue button available to

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,480
their constituents so that they could

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,240
avoid using

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,799
um free and open source software and so

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,640
and have some kind of local control and

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,200
i've been doing a bunch of local

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,240
of advocating with local politicians to

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,320
explain to them

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,919
how how things could be done differently

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,600
and how if we have our own

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,600
um instances that means that we have a

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,960
lot of control over um over how that

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,480
could be and that there are

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,480
um companies that they could hire for

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,840
support and it creates a whole ecosystem

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,760
and then we could improve the tools

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,399
themselves and not rely on

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,200
big proprietary surveillance platforms

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,159
so

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,120
um you know i think that i think that

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,240
it's easy to be

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,880
negative about it because it's

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,799
disheartening to be asked over and over

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
again to use proprietary software

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,159
but one of the great things that came

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,760
out is that we have the alternatives and

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
we can offer them and we just need to

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,480
stick to our guns

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,280
but more importantly provide the

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,760
resources so that folks don't feel

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
feel like the free folks do feel like

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
the free options are

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,639
are really viable and that they'll be

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,399
supported when they do that and each one

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,079
of us should engage with our local

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:34,800
politicians to let them know that this

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:38,560
is the case

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,560
try to move forward in the next slide

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,119
but there we go but then i went too of

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,480
course

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,599
um and so um one of the conferences that

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,839
i mentioned was the ventilator

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
conference

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,520
there was uh what's one thing that has

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,960
been really positive about the pandemic

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,800
is that this idea that

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
we need to come together as a community

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
because there are

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
a real problems that we as a society can

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,560
can solve together

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,400
right away when um when we we all began

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,160
to understand the nature of the pandemic

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,320
people came together and started

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,480
uh locally every people started making

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,480
masks themselves and distributing them

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,920
um you know i had a neighbor who just

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,440
dropped off masks with

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,000
with any household that wanted them on

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,200
the block um people started

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,480
turning to um how we can use 3d printing

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,079
and other technology in order to to help

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
everybody else and there was this case

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,000
of a

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,359
um a hospital in italy that was using

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,760
um 3d printed valves um which

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,400
uh which worked out really well there

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
was some

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,480
misinformation about the whether there

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,359
were

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,760
threats made by the manufacturer over

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,800
the

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,760
um the patents on those devices but

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,720
ultimately

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,520
the company was very happy for these

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,320
valves to be

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,440
printed locally to save lives and there

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,680
was this

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,760
this idea of we're in this together and

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,000
we can all contribute together

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,119
that i think was a win for our society

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,920
during the pandemic and

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,839
uh there are a ton of open source

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,520
ventilator projects public invention has

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,560
identified over a hundred

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,680
and this is one of the areas where we

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,800
have um we have difficulty because we

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,440
have uh we have we have this idea that

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
we're gonna

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
uh scratch our h and i don't need to

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,160
tell a community that comes out of the

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,960
desktop space how tough it is when

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
you've got

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,320
um lots and lots of different viable

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,000
solutions solving

00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,599
try you know working on a similar

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
problem but not fully cooperating

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,839
together

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,200
and this is uh you know much more

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,480
of the case in the um in the ventilator

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,240
space since there are

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,920
just so many of them and there aren't

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,560
just one or two that are really solving

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
the problem

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,880
that are able to um to work together the

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,400
whenever possible the way gnome and kde

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,680
have done for a long time

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,000
but um but uh but in fact the community

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,720
is

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,560
is is so fractured it's so difficult and

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,480
um and part of it is also that there is

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,680
a um

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,480
a uh you know a the

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,599
the the manufacturers are are reluctant

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,280
to participate

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,200
in free and open source software

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,400
solutions for a variety of reasons

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,119
um and uh this uh

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,640
but but there's this idea that we that

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,920
there's an obligation to share that

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
there's an obligation

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,240
at least during the pandemic to help out

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,839
folks that don't have the resources and

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,200
this is a picture of

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,480
a ventilator where

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,880
where the manufacturer made the

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,400
um made the software available

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,599
on a non-commercial license and there

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,359
have been a lot of examples of this

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,599
during the pandemic so one of the wins

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,359
of the pandemic is this idea that people

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,920
have understood that they shouldn't be

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,040
holding back helping other people

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,000
in a in order to prop up proprietary

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
business models

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,680
but at the same time so there's this and

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,720
there's a desire to share

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,520
but at the same time because this desire

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,400
to share

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,640
has not been articulated um in it with

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,560
the degree of depth that we understand

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,680
in the software freedom movement um

00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,800
there are a lot of these

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,000
halfway solutions which are applauded

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,240
as being a fantastic step

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
steps forward and huge steps towards

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,440
sharing

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,359
and actually they're they're not really

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,480
they are short-term solutions that work

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,160
as advertising

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
for the use of the products in the long

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,960
run and

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,119
don't actually bring any kind of

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,839
self-actualization

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,320
or any independence to the the

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,680
communities that will be relying on them

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,599
so you know this this this i guess

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,920
as with anything all of these wins and

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,839
losses are deeply tied up together

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,440
um and and and this is one of those

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,240
things and because

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,599
uh because there are a few people who

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,520
are articulating

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,640
why these um these narrow scope sharing

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,320
licenses

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,880
are problematic and how um you know

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,160
because no one's articulate articulating

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,480
that in the mainstream

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,480
we're losing we've we're losing this

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
opportunity to bring these messages like

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,000
the idea to say

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,079
yes this helps us with this pandemic

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,920
like with this pandoric situation today

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,240
but what about our next pandemic like if

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,280
we don't democratize this technology

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,040
we're just going to be in the same

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,280
situation the next time it happens

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,359
or forget about a pandemic another

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,040
situation where there's a problem where

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,880
we're relying on technology

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,240
and communities don't have control over

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,680
it all over the world

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,000
you know how will we solve that problem

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,720
then the answer is to think holistically

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,760
about our technology instead of thinking

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,560
about it on this

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,520
piecemeal basis and demanding that

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,880
companies are

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,640
more upfront about um their technology

00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,240
and that they rely more on on

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,599
sharing licenses so

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,119
so that was another a huge win and loss

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,040
right

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,640
during the pandemic individuals have

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,040
been under so much stress

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:17,359
and while under ordinary circumstances

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,560
abusers use use smart home devices

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:25,200
to um to manipulate

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:28,240
and and abuse their their partners

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,520
this became even more of

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:36,720
a situation during the pandemic where

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,720
when folks were stuck at home their

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,800
problems that that were um were endemic

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,960
to

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,800
um uh to chew home life became a lot

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,319
worse and so for example

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,319
um domestic abuse rose worldwide during

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,680
covet 19 which is i think

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,000
not a um a huge surprise when you

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,880
think about it but that means that our

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,359
technology

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
is is is more critical than ever and

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,160
educating people about how to control

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,160
their own technology

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,760
and also about coming together as

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,800
communities to be able to vet our

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,720
technology

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,480
um and to provide us with the granulated

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,319
control that we deserve

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,440
has become all the more essential um

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,200
so you know obviously i think this is

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,720
just one of those situations where

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,640
um where it's it's it's one example

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,480
of how um of how the pandemic

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,359
has brought out the the best and the

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,240
worst of our society and of individuals

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,800
and so

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,000
um people are are pointing to the

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,079
inequality

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
that is exacerbated by the pandemic and

00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,000
this is across

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,839
all areas um many people who

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
are um uh who who are

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,680
uh you know don't have as many access to

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,480
resources and who are underprivileged to

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,400
begin with

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
are in a much worse situation during the

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,240
pandemic it's the folks that have to

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,359
go out and work jobs where they're

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,359
delivering food for example or

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:10,319
or interacting with people um

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,760
uh you know uh that have to that can't

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,640
just stay at home the way that a lot of

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
our

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
our tech workers are able to just stay

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,960
at home and hold up

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,960
are much more vulnerable to both

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,400
contracting covadite and then also

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,920
having negative outcomes because

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,960
especially in places like the united

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,200
states where i live

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,000
there is not even access to health care

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,200
um and so

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,119
it's uh it's just deeply problematic

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,960
because all of these inequalities that

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,960
we've already baked into our system

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,599
become even worse and

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,079
you know i i've i've been encouraged to

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,560
see

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,280
how many people in the software freedom

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,960
community

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,400
have been able to weather the storm

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,440
because they

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,400
are able to um to hold up work on their

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,440
tech jobs and um and and it's hard to be

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,839
isolated

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,480
but they're able to protect themselves

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,720
and

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,319
and their families and to be able to

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
keep food on the table and to keep

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,000
paying rent

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,560
um and that is simply not the case for

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,760
everyone

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,839
and we're still um you know all of these

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,720
opportunities that we've um that we've

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,520
we have in tech are are generally have

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,920
been

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,200
unevenly available to people and so you

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,760
know free software

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,440
it clearly has the potential to provide

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,960
opportunities and empower those who are

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,040
disadvantaged it's one of the

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
reasons why i feel so passionately about

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,200
software freedom is it

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,800
it's about democratizing our technology

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,079
but at the same time i i don't know if

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,359
it actually is

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,400
is doing that because we have not done

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,280
a wonderful job of bringing education

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,440
and bringing

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,680
software freedom solutions to people who

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,520
are in disadvantaged communities

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,880
we've had a lot of rhetoric about it but

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,200
we have not

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,800
necessarily been able to have that many

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,079
we haven't had that many successes

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,920
in in in actually taking action

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
to spread the access to software freedom

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,440
and the access to technology

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,200
and using software freedom as a

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,319
mechanism for doing that

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,000
um and so one of the

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,920
the projects that conservancy is

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,359
involved in um and and

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,760
and me personally and uh is our ichi

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,440
which

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,520
was formed as the um

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,440
the outreach program for women when it

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,920
was originally uh

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,119
conceived in the gnome community and

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,839
then

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,359
kde has been a participant over the

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,520
years as well

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,760
so outreachy is an internship program

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,560
that provides opportunities to

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,400
people who are impacted by systemic bias

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,079
and who are underrepresented

00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,599
and who are impacted by that under

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,560
representation

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,119
and so the program is run now such that

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,680
applicants write an essay to explain

00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,560
how they've experienced systemic bias

00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,480
how they've been

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,640
underrepresented and how that affects

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,240
their lives and so having

00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,760
this um having this

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,160
uh this program became even more

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,839
essential during the pandemic

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,200
our application rates

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,520
went through the roof and

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,760
and we've you know we've we've worked

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,760
really hard to try to expand

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,240
the program during this time because we

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,599
see how essential it is we also

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,359
um outreachy had a travel stipend built

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,960
into it where we encouraged people to go

00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,400
and attend free software conferences but

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,200
obviously since none of that is

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,359
happening now

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,560
we turn that into stipends and we paid

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,240
them out to

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,760
pass interns who could have traveled as

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,920
well to help people

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,160
who have already documented themselves

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,160
as uh being impacted by bias and

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,760
underrepresentation to help weather

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,280
through the storm and so

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,119
um you know i'm proud that's something

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,960
that that i've been involved with and we

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,760
worked really hard to try to expand the

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,960
program

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,160
um so even though uh

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,680
a lot of corporate funding has

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,880
contracted during this time we've worked

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,400
really hard to try to increase

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,760
fundraising so we could increase the

00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,520
number of interns

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,880
that we have participating in outreach

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,560
and i'm really proud to say that we're

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,280
about to announce that we have

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,480
approximately uh 70 interns for the

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,000
current round which is

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,480
the biggest round that we've done by far

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,280
usually we're at around 50 interns for a

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
round and so

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,400
we uh we worked really really hard for

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,079
that

00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,480
so um so someone's asking if people can

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,119
read

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,359
the papers of folks that submitted their

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,280
application if they could read their um

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,960
their applications and um and know it we

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,000
don't make those public because

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,200
uh i'm worried about about uh

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,640
we actually just uh we we delete as much

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,160
information as we can because we

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,599
recognize that

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,680
that all these essays and when you read

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,560
them they are so there's so many of them

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,560
contain

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,680
a lot of really personal personal

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,960
information where people talk about

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,720
their bad experiences

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:59,440
and it could be identifying um so

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,440
we don't want to we don't want to risk

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,440
exposing people's personal information

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,440
or inadvertently

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,560
giving enough information that that

00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,359
someone could figure out who our

00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,119
applicants

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,160
were but uh but we work really hard to

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,680
evaluate our

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,119
essays and um

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,040
and uh uh as a as a consequence

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,040
um you know feel feel really good about

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,599
that and so even though in this last

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,079
round

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,680
um we can't we can't provide even though

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,640
we're providing a lot more internships

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,359
than we did

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,200
um it's we're we're going to be unable

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,200
to provide as many internships as i

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,000
would like to or as are needed there's a

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,680
huge

00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,160
need right now um we had 3 000

00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,040
applicants to outreachy over the last

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,079
round

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,760
so i'm proud we can do our part and

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,440
and hopefully we can do more in the

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,640
future so

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:55,839
that's uh you know that's where we are

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,079
are with that but um but nonetheless um

00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,599
uh um i think one of the wins is that we

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,920
are able to scale up outreaching and

00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,000
give people opportunities that they need

00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,640
um to be able to get into this situation

00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,880
where they can be one of the people who

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,880
uh who has a comfortable tech job and

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,599
can provide for their families without

00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,920
having to

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,920
risk

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,880
unsafe practices and i'm being asked

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,000
what our selection process is i don't

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,800
want to get too into it because

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,720
of this isn't a talk about outreachy but

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,160
but we do have a really careful

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,640
um rubric that we use when we

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,839
um you know when we evaluate our

00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,520
applications

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:37,200
so um

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,880
one of the big wins to just move on to a

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,960
slightly different topic

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,960
of the pandemic is that people really

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,680
understand that they're reliant on tech

00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,880
in a way that they didn't before while i

00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,559
think a lot of people thought of

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,920
software as a tool like they would look

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,359
at like a hammer or something they

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,559
looked at their

00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,160
their computers and their their handheld

00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,680
computers aka phones

00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,280
as if they were just these things that

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,240
that you know they could use whenever

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,000
they felt like it

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,839
being in a pandemic made people realize

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,119
how much they're reliant on it a lot of

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,000
for a lot of people

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,920
their phones and their computers were

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,559
their only lifelines to the people they

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,559
loved

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,240
and so they realized that they are

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,880
reliant on tech

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,760
in ways that they they hadn't realized

00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,520
before

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,000
um so uh you know that

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,599
i i think that that is a huge win and i

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,640
think people also in the pandemic

00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,240
realize

00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,920
you know as for example i have relatives

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,839
that now

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,680
use the word zoom bombing like they know

00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,440
what those things mean they understand

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,119
that there are uh surveillance

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,000
components to this technology and they

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,280
understand

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,359
how critical it is um that they

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,760
shrug a little bit less than they used

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,720
to about the fact that uh companies are

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,359
collecting a

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,760
tremendous amount of data on them so

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,760
they

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,359
they they realize that they're more

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,000
reliant um

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,920
on technology than ever before it's like

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,640
a completely different situation than it

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,079
was

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,960
um you know even two or three years ago

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,240
and i have

00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,440
far-flung relatives who are um you know

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,040
non-technical or just never saw

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,480
despite every time me talking about

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,319
software freedom as best as i could at

00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,640
family functions and things like that

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,599
um finally over the last year texting me

00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,920
and saying

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,839
um or emailing me and saying i'm so glad

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,839
you introduced me to these ideas

00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:28,160
before i started reading all of these

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,160
articles because now i see that these

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,000
issues are really important and i'm so

00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,119
glad you've been working on it and so

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,400
it's it's fascinating and

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,160
and it means that we're in a really

00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,280
exciting time where there is a lot of

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,359
opportunity

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,200
um and i think that the

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,960
the part of the problem is that is that

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,359
folks are really beaten down

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,880
by by the fact that they have no choice

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,920
with respect to these technologies so

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,920
they know that they're

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,280
reliant on them and they can see their

00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,400
use of their technology in a way they

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,880
never did before

00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
but they're every bit is feeling like

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,359
they don't have

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,880
that much control there is that power

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,839
dynamic right and they're not in the

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
power seat

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,000
um this is a a slide i like because it

00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,240
has a picture of

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,160
an art exhibit where this artist put out

00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,680
the i printed out the terms and

00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,559
conditions on different colored papers

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,599
for different

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,480
um common services that people use

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:20,960
um and there was a study done that

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
showed that

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,240
you would have to do nothing for a

00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,440
full-time job except read these terms of

00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,359
services for

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,640
three months before you could read just

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,839
the terms of service that the average

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,000
person agrees to

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,880
um in the ordinary online services that

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
they provide

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,240
and they've become desensitized to them

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,520
we all have we all just

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,200
click agree just i agree um

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,720
because you don't really have a choice

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,319
and when someone's invited you to a

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,720
teleconference and you have to

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,839
set up an account and agree to terms

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,000
you're going to do that

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,280
before the conference starts right

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,119
you're not going to have time to

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,960
consider and read all of these terms of

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,440
services and we're not doing a great job

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,359
as

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,200
a society at putting these things in

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:02,559
check

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,079
so so i think that there's this is sort

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,400
of the downside of that

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,200
and um so one of the things that i've

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,559
been working on

00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,119
with um uh with molly de blanc is to

00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,839
create a declaration of digital autonomy

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,440
where we look holistically at all of the

00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:21,839
um uh at what are

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,000
our what we rely on for our technology

00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,839
and um and coming up with principles

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,040
so that we can evaluate our technology

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,160
and demand that we

00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,520
have um uh we have better

00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,920
so um so i recommend checking out

00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,200
techautonomy.org

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,240
and um and uh you know let us know if

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,079
you have any

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,359
any suggestions or feedback i think that

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,200
would be really uh it would be really

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,920
helpful it's just a it's just a draft

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,760
um and um and so we've got we really

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,079
want to get input from people

00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,200
um about what what should be better we

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,440
haven't been thinking about

00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,520
our technology as holistically as we

00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,920
should we suffer freedom advocates have

00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,720
been

00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,520
siloed in our space and um and other

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,119
people who

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,440
are focused on um

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,359
more focused on other areas of ethical

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,400
technology are siloed in their spaces

00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,599
and we need to

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,520
do more work about that i've been doing

00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,599
that in the medical devices space as

00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,800
recently as five years ago i didn't even

00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,079
know there's there's a

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,960
you know there's a a a

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,920
an advocate who uh whose name is hugo

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,280
campus who

00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,520
has the same heart condition as me um

00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,319
he has exactly the same condition as me

00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,040
but he

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,680
is uh he advocates for patient access to

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,559
data

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,040
and you know there are the folks that

00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,559
are

00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,240
doing the hacking work on medical

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,839
devices and we until

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,520
somewhat recently we're not well

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,920
communicated with each other at all

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,599
so we need to do more of that organizing

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,040
and communication so that we all work

00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,920
together and think about our technology

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
as holistically

00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,559
because otherwise software freedom is

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,280
not going to be a part of that

00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,040
discussion

00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,800
and we have to articulate why software

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,319
freedom is important as part of that

00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,760
whole

00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,680
as part of that whole discussion and

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,000
frame it that way

00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,599
so that we can bring the discussion to

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,599
something that we can actually act on

00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,160
um one of the biggest wins in the

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,079
pandemic is that we

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,200
in the free software community we're

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,800
here for each other

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,480
we're a community that talks to each

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,800
other that knows how to communicate

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:24,079
but also we care about each other so

00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,480
um so you know i think that that is just

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,000
uh

00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,319
like one of the things that's the most

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,040
powerful during the during the pandemic

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,480
to remember

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,800
that we've set up these great

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,800
communities and we support each other

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,280
we at conservancy have chats every

00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,760
thursday um and that will happen

00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,160
in two hours a little bit over two hours

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,440
in the conservancy irc channel

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,559
so um

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,000
uh and um and i welcome you to join and

00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,839
the idea is just um

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,520
just a place to chat we talk about

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,920
important software freedom issues but

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,920
also

00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,920
just um just hang out on irc

00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,119
um yeah there's some just i was

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,359
distracted trying to look for a moment

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,760
at the chat in the

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,040
sidebar to um to answer some of those

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,319
questions but i don't do that anyway

00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,280
so coming back around because we're

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,559
getting to the end of this and

00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,520
supporting each other

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,200
uh nobody guessed the right conference

00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,079
at the beginning of the talk

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,319
the talk the the conference that i

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,960
linked to was the desktop summit

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,440
in gran canaria in 2009 which is one of

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,799
the very first conferences that

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,400
that i i participated wholeheartedly in

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,839
and it was really fun for me because i

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,640
was a lawyer to both

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,760
kde and um and gnome at my in that at

00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,880
that time i was still at the software

00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,280
freedom law center

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,960
um and it was super fun to flip between

00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,599
the gnome community and the kde

00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,359
community

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,400
and the reason why i'm coming back to

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:53,520
that is that in 2009 in gran canaria

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,400
i felt like i i

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,359
honestly at that point i had felt like i

00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,160
was coming to

00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,400
suffer freedom too late i felt like

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,880
everything had happened already i felt

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
like

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,920
uh like oh if i'd only been there in you

00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:10,079
know

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,799
in in 2000 and in you know 2002 2000 if

00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,480
i'd only

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,799
had the confidence when i first started

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,319
participating in 2005 to become more

00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,359
involved and to do more

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:21,680
uh you know i felt like you know

00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,280
like like i had missed it it all

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,839
happened all the important things were

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,640
done

00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,640
and looking back that is so laughable

00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,040
like there's absolutely

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,440
there's so much has happened in in in

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:37,359
the in the time since then and i wish

00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,559
that i had realized that um

00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:44,079
i wish i had realized that um at

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:45,680
that desktop in gran canaria that

00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,440
so much would happen and that everyone

00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,799
who was there was a part of it and so if

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,760
this is your first

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,559
conference um if las is your first

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,280
conference

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,400
or if um if you you've started quite

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,640
recently

00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,000
don't feel like your opinion doesn't

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,960
matter and don't feel

00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,200
like uh like so much has has already

00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,799
happened and you've missed it because

00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,640
what matters is what's happening right

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,359
now if we've learned anything from the

00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,920
pandemic

00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,119
it's that uh and richard cushing i'm so

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,040
glad you're here for this being your

00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,240
first conference that is so cool

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,280
um uh and and matthias

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,440
uh gides too fantastic so

00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,960
like the main the if we learn anything

00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,079
from the pandemic is that we don't know

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,480
what's coming down the road

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,119
we have to be ready we have to work

00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,359
together

00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,880
and we are constantly need to iterate

00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:34,319
the what we're doing for software

00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,160
freedom to get people to understand it

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,200
and to make a world where we can rely on

00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,400
our technology

00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,200
better and i'm so hoping that i can see

00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,680
all of you

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,319
soon um in person so that we can meet

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,079
and have

00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,000
those kinds of fantastic personal

00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,799
dynamics that we have when we get

00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,720
together

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,319
but i know that the fact that we can

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,920
participate here and now

00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:59,359
and here and also uh charles

00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:01,520
sirois or syrah i'm glad you're here too

00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,640
and so um i look forward to meeting you

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,240
all and seeing you all

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,960
thank you so much for participating this

00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,960
because together we will figure out

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,319
what we've learned from the pandemic we

00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,240
will celebrate our wins

00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,839
learn from our losses and be better

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,280
together so

00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,680
thank you so much for listening and i'm

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,200
gonna see if there's time for

00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,960
um i think i answered most of the

00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,160
questions as they came up in

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:27,200
the um

00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,760
uh in the chat i think christy said

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,799
there were

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,760
shared notes very strange giving

00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,920
conversation

00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,839
giving like a talk to like just seeing

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,839
myself and not anybody else

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,119
yeah and i think that one of the

00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,520
questions is also interesting because

00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,599
it says that you think uh so i'm going

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,839
first with the first question

00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,960
how and why do you think we failed in

00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:53,760
the adaptation of this

00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,440
different free and open tools so maybe

00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,240
that's somehow related

00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,359
to the beginning of your presentation if

00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,319
you'd like we can

00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:04,079
first answer this yeah i mean i think i

00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,520
covered that i think we were ready with

00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,960
our technological solutions and we were

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,920
ready with our rhetoric but we didn't

00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,079
bring it together

00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,200
we didn't provide the infrastructure and

00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,760
we didn't

00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,280
uh advertise it in a coordinated way at

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,240
the beginning of the pandemic

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,079
we didn't empower individuals and we

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,040
were all struggling independently to try

00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,799
to deal with

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,880
our own personal issues during the

00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,240
pandemic i know anybody who was a parent

00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,559
had little kids that were home all the

00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,760
time

00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,839
anyone who you know anyone who has an

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,200
underlying condition was terrified that

00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,880
we were going to

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,720
get sick and many people were dealing

00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,000
with being sick

00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,520
and dealing with loved ones who were

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,240
sick and so there were significant

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,160
challenges

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,920
but i think that we should what we can

00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,400
do is we can learn from that and come up

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,520
with

00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,799
with a more coordinated way of

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,440
of dealing with these issues in the

00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:53,040
future um and it's important coming

00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,240
together in conferences but it's also

00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,680
through a lot of collection

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,119
collective action and having our

00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,839
rhetoric ready for the next time that it

00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,839
happens as well as our solutions

01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,720
great the second question do you think

01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,680
adoption

01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:12,240
of remote tools will stay for future

01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,839
false events after the pandemic ends

01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,160
considering from a point of view where

01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:19,200
it helps spread out the word for people

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,559
who are unable to travel yes i think

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,000
that we've learned a lot from that in

01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,520
that regard too is i think that we're

01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,359
going to continue to provide better

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,160
mechanisms for people to participate

01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,760
remotely

01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,680
and so having conferences where there's

01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,760
a hybrid component

01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,160
um uh is really good i think one of the

01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,079
things that i i loved is that that i i

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,280
i might do more of in the future is

01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,960
having uh

01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,559
and we might do a conservancy is having

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,760
pre-recorded talks where

01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,280
the speaker can engage with um with

01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,040
questions during the talk

01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,960
um as i said at the beginning to heckle

01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,200
themselves which is a

01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,400
a you know pretty silly way of referring

01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,160
to it but but

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,599
i think that a lot of those mechanisms

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,000
to the extent that we're doing remote

01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,680
events

01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,359
will stick and i think that having

01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,200
remote sessions that are tacked onto

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,480
in-person conferences

01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,640
will be essential and i hope that all

01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:10,480
the conference organizers continue to

01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:12,559
evaluate that

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,839
i see there's a question about gpl or

01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,440
later

01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:17,200
which i think is really out of scope for

01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,520
this so

01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,520
um

01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,119
uh oh but that was the end of the

01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:29,359
questions these the rest of these were

01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,359
uh were for the previous talk

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,000
yes so i guess that we have we had these

01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,559
two questions

01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,319
the the shared notes for you to answer

01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:44,799
uh thank you so so much for joining us

01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:47,520
for joining us on this lesson really

01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,760
hope to see you in person soon

01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,359
me too thank you so much for organizing

01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
it and to all of the organizers you are

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,359
all so

01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,559
awesome and this is so hard to do so

01:01:55,359 --> 01:02:00,559
um i think everybody give your

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,680
your muted applause to them because they

01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:06,799
are fantastic

01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:09,760
thank you so much thank you karen

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,799
so now we'll have a break it will be a

01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,160
30 minute break

01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:18,559
and we will hear each other again

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,559
at 5 30 pm utc

01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,839
thank you

01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:09,920
hi we have 30 minutes well just

01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,920
under uh 30 minutes about 20 before we

01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,760
start the next segment

01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,560
uh be sure to um for our speakers dan

01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,880
and aryan

01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:23,920
uh please click the blue headset button

01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:28,239
underneath the slides so you can

01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,239
rejoin the audio and access your

01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,840
microphone

01:18:52,800 --> 01:19:09,840
hi there just a reminder we will start

01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:09,840
in 20 minutes please enjoy a brief break

01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:30,480
hello and welcome back

01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:33,920
how is everyone

01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:37,520
all right well we now

01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,719
have argan and dan talking about how to

01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,440
make your application

01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,199
multi-platform thank you both very much

01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:46,239
for being here today

01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:50,880
very excited to have you

01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:50,880
um please take it away get started

01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:57,119
thank you allison um so yeah let's

01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,560
let's first start by introducing

01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:00,560
ourselves i'm uh

01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,480
aryan i'm a software consultant working

01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,679
for xivia in the netherlands

01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:08,000
and i'm doing lots of coding

01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,440
also in my spare time and next to that

01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,280
like cycling and

01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:14,880
beer brewing my name is danielle i'm

01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,440
really excited to give this talk with

01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,080
aryan

01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,760
um for my day job i work for ford motor

01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:23,040
company where i design

01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,880
safety into complex electrified and

01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,280
automated technologies

01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,360
and um in my free time i've been working

01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,520
on this app with aryan in order to model

01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,400
these complex systems using open source

01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:36,800
software

01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,800
and also like cycling like aryan does

01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:45,520
so what are we going to uh talk about

01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,639
um it's about uh going multi-platform so

01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,679
first of all

01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:51,119
we ask ourselves the question why do you

01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,320
actually want to bother

01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:55,199
and secondly i'm going we're going to

01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,400
give a brief

01:39:55,199 --> 01:40:00,080
introduction of uh our case the modeling

01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:03,199
tool

01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,600
and and next we're going to see what we

01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,800
did

01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:10,480
for linux windows and mac os

01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:14,000
and lastly there are some takeaways

01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:16,480
that hopefully you can bring to your own

01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,480
projects

01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,960
what at least in our case

01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,880
uh we're developing a software and what

01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:31,520
we want is to have a

01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:36,159
uh these apps to be useful for others so

01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:38,400
people get value out of it and

01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:39,440
better they are actually ready to

01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,880
contribute back

01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,880
to the to the project

01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,960
and if you look at this chart you see

01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:51,760
that actually

01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:53,840
the potential of doing that for a linux

01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,480
only application is

01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,840
uh well you're covering not that much of

01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:01,119
the the potential

01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,159
user base at best for developer tools

01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:06,000
it's it's

01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:10,239
roughly 25 percent um

01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:13,520
so uh well we were leaving out a lot of

01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:14,560
potential users uh by just staying on

01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,960
linux

01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,600
so that's why we made an effort to also

01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,360
cover

01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,360
the other desktop platforms

01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,960
so what was our reasoning for going

01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:32,000
multi-platform

01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:35,040
a broader and more inclusive user base

01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,679
so not only people

01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:39,600
that are uh like-minded on linux for

01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:44,840
example but also people for

01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:48,239
with windows and and a mac

01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:49,840
background um we think it can help

01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:52,960
people introduce

01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:56,400
being introduced to open source

01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:59,440
um if you're on these other platforms

01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:04,719
uh using open source tooling is not

01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,719
that that much present

01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,360
for us also it's a sense of

01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:12,480
being future proof you know we're not

01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,679
tied to

01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:18,159
this particular operating system

01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,760
which also ties in with with the fourth

01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:23,600
point

01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:28,080
it we improve

01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:30,239
the the adaptability people are not do

01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,600
not have to use linux so for example if

01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,560
you want to use this tool on your

01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,880
project

01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,159
it would be a bit sad if you leave out

01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,080
your uh

01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:40,560
your fellow teammates that are only

01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,560
using

01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,840
windows

01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:55,119
so well what are we targeting

01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,119
the major desktop platforms

01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:59,199
in doing so we try to uh automate as

01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:02,719
much as possible

01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:06,480
we're doing it in our spare time and

01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:09,679
doing uh tasks by hand

01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:11,840
is labor intensive and and it's really

01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:15,600
prone to error

01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:19,520
and also we don't want to scare away

01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:20,880
people with with those scary messages

01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:25,840
that you nowadays have

01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,840
on windows and mac os

01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:40,080
so on to our use case

01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:43,119
um we uh

01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:48,159
both work on kafor which is

01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:50,880
a modeling tool that supports uml csml

01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:52,159
uh ramul i hope i pronounced it right

01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,760
then

01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:55,760
which is a risk assessment

01:43:56,159 --> 01:44:01,440
modeling language and c4

01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,360
modeling language which is more

01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,320
simplified

01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:07,360
more easily accessible it's running on

01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,119
gtk

01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:11,440
as you might see from the from the

01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:14,560
screenshot

01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:15,600
it's written in python so it's it's

01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:19,280
roughly

01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:23,119
44 000 lines of python code

01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:26,239
of course with well with gtk bindings

01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:30,000
and i started this project almost

01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:31,280
20 years ago um with the idea that that

01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,119
it can breach a gap

01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:37,920
between technical people and less

01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,920
technical people

01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:45,520
so about four years ago i started to get

01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:47,040
involved with before as well

01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,119
i was looking for an open source

01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,880
modeling tool that i could use to model

01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:52,400
these really complex systems that i

01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,159
talked about earlier

01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,000
so for example if you had a car that

01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:58,719
could park itself

01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,360
we would design how the behavior and

01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,400
structure

01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:04,560
and requirements of that vehicle would

01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:08,000
all work together safely

01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,440
and i stumbled across before and i was

01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,159
really immediately blown away

01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,639
it was i'm really simple to use and was

01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:15,440
also

01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:17,040
um using python which for me out you

01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:19,199
know i'm not a professional

01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,560
software developer um was a lot more

01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,400
accessible to me

01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,840
um to kind of jump right in and get

01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,679
started

01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:27,119
um and unfortunately at the time aryan

01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,360
had gotten busy with other

01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:30,880
projects so the project uh hadn't been

01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:33,040
updated in a while

01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,800
and we'll kind of talk over the next

01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:38,480
couple slides about

01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:45,840
um yeah how we brought it back up to uh

01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:45,840
to be modern again

01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,600
so next we're going to discuss how you

01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:58,000
can set up your project for success

01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:00,480
um with kind of these tips we learned

01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,480
the hard way

01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,360
so when we first you know when i first

01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:08,480
picked up the app um before had this

01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:10,320
docking widget called etk docking

01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,080
um and it created an experience that

01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:14,960
you'd expect from like a complex

01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:17,920
ide like eclipse so where it allowed you

01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:18,719
to rearrange and hide and maximize and

01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,760
pop out

01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:24,320
ui components and that required creating

01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:27,440
some really custom

01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:30,719
gui widgets and gtk

01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:32,560
gtk 2 in this case and pi gtk which were

01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:34,560
the python bindings at the time

01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,600
and although it was really clever it

01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,159
would have had to

01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:40,480
been completely rewritten from scratch

01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:42,960
um to move to gtk3

01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:45,600
and pi g object which are that which is

01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,840
the introspection library for gtk

01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,480
and also we were upgrading from python 2

01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:52,800
to python 3 at the same time

01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,000
also if you came across a bug or an

01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,719
issue it was really

01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,119
hard to get it fixed because you are i

01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:59,360
would say

01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:00,800
exploring the edge cases of the gui

01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,719
toolkit itself

01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,560
and probably most other people haven't

01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,400
run into a similar problem before

01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,960
because you're really creating these

01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,639
very custom widgets here's a small

01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:12,800
example

01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,159
where we defined our own compact button

01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,520
so the compact button is

01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:20,639
inheriting from the gtk widget

01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:23,280
and it has a couple of class

01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,320
definite class properties defined for

01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,880
the name

01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:28,159
and also the signals and properties and

01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,119
they're defined in those

01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:32,880
um double underscore definitions or also

01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:35,679
called dunder

01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,280
and the first ones the name named etk

01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:39,119
combat button and then there's two

01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:42,400
python dictionaries that define the

01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,400
signals and the properties

01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:52,239
so i guess reflecting on this do

01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:53,520
you know users really need that much

01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:56,880
customization

01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:58,800
in their in their ui um

01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,320
and i think keeping things simple and

01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,920
consistent and aligned with the human

01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,560
interface guidelines is really the way

01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,920
to go

01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,920
so that you don't have these like

01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:09,119
painful upgrades

01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:11,280
um gtk and cute already provide you know

01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:13,520
this really great foundation to build

01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,360
gui applications with

01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,199
and in the same vein that you want to

01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:19,040
keep your gui pretty simple

01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:21,679
i would also try to keep your tool set

01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:24,480
small and simple as well

01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:26,159
so try to keep to just a few libraries

01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:29,600
and make sure those libraries

01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:31,440
are well supported cross-platform

01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,600
here is an example for the dependencies

01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:36,080
of before so you can see here

01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,040
that of course we depend on python

01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,280
itself

01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,719
and pi g object provides the python

01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:43,760
bindings

01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:46,159
for gtk pi chiral

01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,280
is the canvas widget and then we have

01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:49,520
two of our own

01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,719
libraries that we also support one's

01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,840
called gafos

01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:55,280
and it provides a diagramming widget

01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,520
which allows you to

01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,480
draw shapes and relationships to the

01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,600
shapes

01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:03,280
and generic is a generic programming or

01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,320
multi-dispatch

01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:09,119
um i guess library that allows you to

01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:10,320
call functions or methods based on the

01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:13,760
type

01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:15,679
and finally recently aryan added css

01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,920
support for skinning

01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:22,639
the diagrams and customizing how they

01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,639
look and so we depend on css2 as well

01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:28,560
this is one nice thing for us for python

01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,119
as well that

01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,320
batteries are also included and you have

01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,960
most of what you need

01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,400
already to build even very complex

01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,400
applications

01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:40,480
there are tools like cookie cutter which

01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,199
help you fully create a new project from

01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,000
scratch

01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:44,639
using the best practices for things like

01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,719
testing

01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,679
and packed packaging already set up for

01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:52,320
you that's a really big advantage

01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,080
for before we also use a more modern pi

01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,880
project dot tomml

01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:59,520
to configure our project instead of kind

01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:02,000
of the more legacy setup.pi

01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,280
and we use poetry for building the

01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,440
project into a wheel

01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,800
and then uploading it to the python

01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,520
package index or pi

01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,400
pi but there's also a few other tools

01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,280
like flit

01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:15,040
and pip tools that are great as well in

01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,800
other words i recommend setting up your

01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,520
project based on the language you are

01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,080
using

01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,599
their their best practices and then try

01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:24,080
to design a gui

01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:26,639
that will conform to the gui's interface

01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,639
guidelines

01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:33,280
packaging your app so they can be easily

01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:36,239
installed on each platform is

01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:38,239
a very challenging problem each platform

01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:41,040
really needs its own solution

01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:42,400
and next we'll talk through talk about

01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,159
some of the tips we learned along the

01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,840
way

01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:48,000
i would say kind of the previous

01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,080
solution for linux

01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,440
and i guess maybe i'll pause and say

01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,080
sorry our emojis

01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,560
aren't showing up in the slides that was

01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:58,000
a

01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:59,920
cool smiley face um yeah so some of the

01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,599
previous solutions were things like deb

01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:04,639
and rpm

01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:06,800
um in our great solutions but it also

01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:08,880
made it difficult for app developers to

01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,639
get the latest version of your app

01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,719
out to their users because it often

01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,639
required um

01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:17,440
i guess people to upgrade their actual

01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:20,159
distribution to get the new versions

01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:21,360
flat pack and at the distribution

01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:24,000
platform for it

01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:26,639
called flat hub provide a great way to

01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,920
distribute your apps for linux

01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,679
i guess the format is really great

01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:32,400
because it sandboxes your app

01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:34,239
it allows installation by non-root users

01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:35,280
and also has really good desktop

01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:37,679
integration

01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:39,119
one of the killer features for as an app

01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:42,320
developer that we found

01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:43,440
was um the maintained platforms called

01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,199
runtimes

01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,280
and these really provide that strong

01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:49,599
foundation to package your app

01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:52,480
on top of with all the dependencies you

01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,480
need included

01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:58,719
one of the challenges we faced with flat

01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:01,119
pack was getting a reliable build script

01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:04,480
to work with python dependencies

01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:05,199
flat pack uses a manifest file which is

01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,639
a sort of

01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:10,960
recipe in json or yaml format

01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:12,960
and among other things the manifest has

01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:17,040
all of your dependencies for your app

01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:20,639
including the download url for it and

01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:23,920
as well as the sha 256 um sum

01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,840
the hash of the of the of the file this

01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,840
helps ensures that the flat pack build

01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,679
is rep reproducible

01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:31,119
so that you get the same result each

01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:32,880
time

01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,040
and although there's a flat pack builder

01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,920
tool for python it uses pip to

01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,639
re-resolve

01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:40,000
all the project dependencies and it

01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,639
defaults to using

01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,800
source distributions instead of of the

01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:46,159
binary format that python has called a

01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,480
wheel

01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,199
we tried to use this for a while and

01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,159
even um

01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:53,040
created a poetry builder tool that we

01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:56,159
upstreamed

01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:58,320
um to the flat pack builder tools

01:52:56,159 --> 01:53:00,480
however every time we went to go make a

01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,000
new release something would break

01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:04,320
and we'd have to troubleshoot for a

01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,159
while and this is not really what you

01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:08,159
want from a release process

01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:09,920
you want it to be simple and reliable

01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:11,760
and automated so you can just push out a

01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,599
new version to your users

01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,040
so to fix this we end up using a simple

01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:18,400
bash script

01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:19,119
um and what it does is download a the

01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:22,320
wheel

01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:24,480
off of pi pi that python package index

01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,599
um with all of its dependencies and then

01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,560
writes um

01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:30,000
the download url and the the hash the

01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,920
manifest

01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,719
here you can see in this bash script we

01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:38,159
use pip to download the new version

01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:40,639
we use find and awk to list

01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:43,360
all the dependencies we downloaded it

01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:45,360
and put them in two columns with a name

01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,440
and the the name of the package and the

01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:50,800
file name and then we use curl

01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:54,639
and um jq to

01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:57,280
hit the pi pi endpoint and get the um

01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:59,599
the url and that the hash so that we can

01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:01,119
put that in the manifest

01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:02,560
dash scripts aren't the solution to

01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,520
everything in this case it made our

01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:05,679
manifest

01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,560
generation really simple and reliable

01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:10,560
and it has been great ever since

01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:12,560
a second challenge is that flat hub uses

01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,840
a separate github repository to build

01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,159
all the packages

01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,159
what is great that everything is set up

01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:20,159
to do automated builds

01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,599
and publish a flat hub it also adds a

01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,080
little bit of extra complexity and

01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:24,639
maintenance

01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,920
because now you're packaging a split

01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:30,400
between your main repo

01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,400
and the one that flat hub provides

01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,520
so next i'll talk for a minute about app

01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,440
image because it's another great

01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,480
solution

01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:42,239
um so after we had been supporting flat

01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:44,000
pack for a while we got a request from

01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:45,520
one of our users to create an app image

01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,920
and i was a little familiar with it

01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:51,119
because i had downloaded app images for

01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:52,639
other python apps in the past and

01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:55,199
i always thought it was nice because you

01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:57,119
have this single file format that you

01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:59,360
can download and just run from there and

01:54:57,119 --> 01:55:01,599
you don't have anything to install

01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:03,040
one thing we did learn while packaging

01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:04,560
our app for app image

01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:06,800
was because there's no external

01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,719
dependencies that also means for the

01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:11,599
developer you can't rely

01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,760
on these runtimes or other dependencies

01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:16,239
being available for you when you go to

01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,960
build the app image this does create

01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:19,920
some tension

01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,920
because i would like my app to be using

01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,920
the latest version of python

01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:25,760
the latest versions of the gui toolkits

01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,920
and other dependencies

01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:28,880
and this because this is open source and

01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,639
i want to

01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,239
always be developing on the latest and

01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,960
greatest and keep things

01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:36,239
simple and more fun to develop with and

01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:39,599
also probably a little bit more

01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:41,599
secure unfortunately things like glibc

01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,199
aren't backwards compatible so you

01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:45,119
should really build your app

01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:48,480
against an older distribution to

01:55:45,119 --> 01:55:48,480
maximize compatibility

01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:53,360
unfortunately some of those older

01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:54,960
distributions then don't ship with

01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,960
you know newer versions of things like

01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,159
gtk they're often three to five years

01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,920
out of date

01:55:58,159 --> 01:56:01,920
there are tools to help with this and

01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:03,760
even darker containers

01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,960
with the right dependencies you can use

01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:08,480
but this isn't as

01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:08,480
straightforward as we would have liked

01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:16,560
so for windows msys2 provides

01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:18,239
in a great environment for building

01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,840
installing and running applications in

01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:22,800
windows

01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,119
it has a bash command prompt so a lot of

01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,360
you

01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:26,880
if you're used to working in linux will

01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,320
feel pretty comfortable and right at

01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,360
home

01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:34,080
it is also the recommended way to run a

01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:36,000
ggk application in windows

01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:38,480
and once we got before running in

01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,880
windows we used pi installer which is a

01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:43,360
python library to bundle it with all the

01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,199
needed dependencies

01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:46,480
however this wasn't all smooth sailing

01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:50,159
either

01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:53,599
python and msys2 has many patches

01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:56,880
um in order to get it to compile against

01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:58,800
ming ww64 gcc

01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,639
instead of the default microsoft visual

01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,480
c plus plus

01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,320
that's what python is normally built

01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:06,639
with in windows

01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:08,159
since msys2 is kind of a niche

01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:11,119
environment in windows

01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:12,880
python and most of the libraries aren't

01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,840
very well tested in it

01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,119
and it is common for things to break we

01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,040
were able though to

01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:20,800
contribute upstream and get pull

01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:23,360
requests merged to projects

01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,320
like virtual and for the virtual

01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:27,360
environments

01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:29,280
pi installer and poetry to fix bugs and

01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:31,920
improve compatibility

01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,199
although this you know yak shaving isn't

01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,880
directly making our app

01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:36,400
better it does improve the overall

01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:39,119
ecosystem for others

01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:40,639
to make use of it as well i hope we can

01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:42,960
eventually get some of these

01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:45,760
downstream patches to python pushed

01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,760
upstream as well

01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:51,440
after feedback from our users we also

01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:53,440
did implement code sighting in windows

01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:55,040
and windows users were getting those

01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,440
kind of scary messages

01:57:55,040 --> 01:58:00,239
saying hey this app that you download is

01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:02,159
not safe to run from the internet

01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:04,239
this does involve paying a couple

01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,599
hundred dollars a year on a code signing

01:58:04,239 --> 01:58:07,520
certificate

01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,440
and was a little bit of a foreign

01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:11,280
experience for us but it was pretty easy

01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:13,760
to integrate it with our continuous

01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:15,520
integration build process here you can

01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,080
see the sign tool that ships with a

01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,119
windows

01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:21,040
sdk signs the application using their

01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:24,239
certificate

01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:28,800
a timestamp server that's with that

01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:32,199
tr and also td and fd provide the

01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,679
time stamp and the file digest using the

01:58:32,199 --> 01:58:35,040
sha-256

01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:38,800
and we're able to integrate that with

01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,800
our continuous integration for the app

01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,920
so that kind of brings us to the last

01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,840
platform

01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:50,960
which is mac os on mac os we kind of

01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:54,000
have a

01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:56,800
similar ish situation to windows

01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,920
but not that bad because macos under the

01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,360
hood already has

01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:05,599
a bsd like

01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:09,199
unix environment bc unix environment

01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,840
and there is a project called homebrew

01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:12,480
which is

01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:12,960
which you can use to install all sorts

01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:15,040
of

01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,040
open source dependencies and this also

01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:20,639
includes gtk

01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:24,239
which is really fortunate for our

01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,239
effort to make it running on mac os

01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:28,080
and next to that of course we also have

01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:31,760
to deal with the

01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:34,000
with the code signing um

01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:36,800
on mac os for those who are not really

01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,800
familiar with it

01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,080
you build an app which is kind of like

01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:43,280
an app image on

01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:47,360
on linux as dan

01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:50,880
explained it contains

01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:54,159
files with a particular starting file

01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:55,520
which is the info.plist

01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:57,280
and from there basically the whole

01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,360
application is started

01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:01,280
so the the app directory contains

01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,639
everything

02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:04,320
our application but also the

02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,800
dependencies that we use that are not

02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:09,440
native

02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,440
on mac os such as gtk

02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:13,280
next to that it's common to distribute

02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:16,639
this app

02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:18,159
in a disk image which is

02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,480
something like well you can think of it

02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:24,239
like like an iso image

02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:26,239
it's a read-only image that

02:00:24,239 --> 02:00:27,520
well that basically packages the

02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:29,840
application

02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:31,760
you can set the background in it and it

02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,159
give it a nice appearance when people

02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:35,440
first

02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:40,000
start well downloaded it

02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:42,560
and and start it up

02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,440
um one thing that we had to deal with

02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,880
which is

02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:48,960
uh quite different from how it works on

02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:51,280
linux is that library references all

02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,400
are all absolute so if you compile

02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:55,119
something against

02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:56,000
a certain library that library should be

02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:59,920
in

02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:01,280
is in a particular folder on your path

02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,000
you should not move it because then

02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,000
stuff breaks

02:01:04,159 --> 02:01:10,400
in order to get it in the app

02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:11,360
folder however yeah you need to copy it

02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:14,400
over

02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:16,880
and there are some uh tricks

02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:19,360
tricks you can do some renaming to make

02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,960
sure that for example the library is not

02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:24,320
absolutely referenced but it's

02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:26,800
referenced relative to the

02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:28,320
to the executable binary which in our

02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:33,280
case is the the second file

02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:33,280
in this example the the macos gav4 file

02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,719
thirdly there is some work that has to

02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,920
be done with environment variables so

02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:43,360
that for example

02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:46,560
font config works the xdg

02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:50,880
directories are set properly and

02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:54,480
stuff like pixbuff modules are loaded

02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:55,840
as you would expect we used to use our

02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:59,199
own script for that

02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:02,880
which was again a nice

02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:06,400
well i said it piece of basher

02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:09,760
magic um however

02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,360
uh at some point when the the mech of

02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:14,480
the the windows build was

02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:15,920
working properly it proved to be quite

02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:17,920
easy to also

02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:20,560
do the build for mac os with buy

02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:23,840
installer so that that's what we

02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:27,040
uh move towards and uh well actually we

02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:27,040
well we never looked back

02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,400
it saves us a lot of uh maintaining is

02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:36,320
what we used to have is that with every

02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:40,480
uh big update even on on homebrew or

02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:42,880
on or on macos itself

02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:44,080
we needed to revise our packaging script

02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:45,840
because something broke

02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:49,280
and now with my installer we haven't had

02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,280
that problem since

02:02:54,159 --> 02:03:01,040
lastly then there is the designing

02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:04,400
to avoid the scary messages for

02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:09,040
for users so dan is actually an

02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:09,040
official apple developer nowadays

02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:14,880
so that we can sign the application and

02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,119
just like windows everything is

02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:20,560
performed in the build pipeline

02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:22,960
which saves us quite a bit of work

02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:26,560
actually

02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:30,400
because for the signing we need to sign

02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:32,560
both the the app so the dot app

02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,840
folder and everything in it needs to be

02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,320
signed

02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:38,159
and once that's done it can be packaged

02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,400
in the disk image and that also has to

02:03:38,159 --> 02:03:40,000
be

02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,920
signed so you can imagine what that

02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,280
would be if you would have to do that

02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,280
for every release by hand

02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,400
here at the bottom i pasted a little

02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:59,920
screenshot

02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:02,320
of what it looks like when we do an

02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,079
average build this is just something

02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:06,079
that i picked from

02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:07,920
well quite recently i don't know where

02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:11,440
it was it was not a release build

02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:13,440
that you can see by the version names

02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:14,560
and what you can see is that everything

02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,560
like the app image

02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:21,599
the the mac os image the two installers

02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:26,000
for for windows that is the

02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:29,199
the pure python executable

02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:32,079
and there is the python executable the

02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:32,079
the source code

02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:39,760
um what we learned from all of this is

02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,800
that uh we should approach each platform

02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,840
separately

02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:46,880
um initially we had uh

02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:49,440
well actually our first platform that we

02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:52,560
supported was mac os

02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:57,440
and only after that

02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:59,760
we implemented a flat flat pack

02:04:57,440 --> 02:05:00,960
then came windows which allowed us to

02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,159
revise

02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,800
mac os and after that the the app image

02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:06,239
so

02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,599
the order in which things happens which

02:05:06,239 --> 02:05:09,440
is not the order in which we explain

02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:12,639
them

02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:14,960
um what also helped a lot was to work

02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:17,440
with upstream projects

02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,239
especially ironing out issues for

02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:21,520
example in

02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:25,520
by installer safety says well

02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,520
nowadays it saves us a lot of hassle

02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:31,119
and well we integrate everything in the

02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,400
build pipeline so

02:05:31,119 --> 02:05:36,320
when we do a release basically nothing

02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:37,599
special happens except from that the

02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:40,239
version number

02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:43,040
is not a death version but this is a

02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:43,040
release version

02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:52,000
um well this

02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:52,000
of takes us to the end of our

02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:56,079
presentation

02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:05,520
i see no questions in the

02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:05,520
shared note so far

02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:10,560
we are excited to answer your questions

02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,560
if you have any

02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:20,400
obviously

02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,400
what about security what do you mean

02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:34,000
security

02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:37,520
um as part of the i don't know if this

02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:41,760
answers your question but um flatback

02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,760
applications are started in a

02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:47,040
in a container basically kind of kind of

02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:50,239
a containerized environment

02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:53,119
and as part of the manifest we provide

02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,920
some well we request some permissions

02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:59,280
like

02:06:53,920 --> 02:07:00,960
access to the to the file system

02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:03,679
and that is taken care of in the flat

02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:06,719
packs and i think if you install them

02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:10,560
the flat pack will ask you for

02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:12,960
permission or your consent

02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:15,119
on the permissions that the application

02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:18,239
is asking for

02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:18,239
does that answer your question

02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:29,040
looks like the next question is have you

02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:30,320
experimented to use flat pack on windows

02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:34,639
with

02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:37,199
um windows subsystem for linux 2

02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:39,119
so we haven't experimented with that and

02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:41,440
it's because i think mostly

02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:43,199
our build environment is that emphasis

02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:46,719
to one and not

02:07:43,199 --> 02:07:46,719
windows subsystem for linux

02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:52,320
i guess i've seen recently that

02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:54,719
windows subsystem from linux is actually

02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,920
able to run gui applications as well so

02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:57,840
maybe in the future there's some

02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,000
potential there where you could

02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:01,599
um actually use windows subsystem for

02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,719
linux to uh

02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:06,480
package your gtk admob for windows

02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:08,719
but we haven't experimented with that

02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:11,599
yet we're still using

02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,119
msys2 for our packaging and to my

02:08:11,599 --> 02:08:17,040
knowledge the

02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:18,320
the the gui support from wsl is

02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:23,199
experimental still

02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:26,239
so it's not a mainstream feature

02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:29,840
uh what are you missing most on flatup

02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:33,840
from a developer perspective um

02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:36,560
well i think that then pointed that out

02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:38,400
kind of is that we have our flat pack

02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,639
built currently in a separate repository

02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:44,000
so it means that we have to

02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:47,440
kick off a separate build to actually

02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,159
perform the flat pack build

02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,520
and it would be really nice if we could

02:08:50,159 --> 02:08:54,880
integrate that

02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:58,079
with our with our main line

02:08:54,880 --> 02:09:01,280
so that we for example also can do uh

02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:04,079
nightly builds from flat pack

02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:06,159
call them nightly just every commit

02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:07,920
create a fresh build for uh for

02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:10,159
flat pack for everybody who wants to be

02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:12,320
a cutting edge which is probably dan and

02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:12,320
me

02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:19,599
so the next question is how is the build

02:09:17,199 --> 02:09:20,880
pipeline built what software or services

02:09:19,599 --> 02:09:24,000
compose it

02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:25,280
so our project is using github

02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,760
although you know there's lots of other

02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:30,960
good alternatives like git lab as well

02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,159
um so we are using github actions um and

02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,639
actually we

02:09:32,159 --> 02:09:35,920
iterated a few times on that as well we

02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:38,400
were

02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:39,119
used a few different services over time

02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,800
um

02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:42,719
but eventually would github actions was

02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:45,119
released we started using that

02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:47,040
um it is nice because some of the

02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:48,800
actions are reusable so you don't have

02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:50,719
to figure out say

02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:52,800
you know how to check out your code how

02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:54,079
to sign an app all those different steps

02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:55,840
you can just grab an

02:09:54,079 --> 02:09:57,199
action that's already been developed and

02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,280
it does a lot of the work for you which

02:09:57,199 --> 02:10:01,440
is really nice

02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:04,079
and we make use of other things other

02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:06,320
automations like to label our pr's and

02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:09,440
automatically create our news

02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:12,239
um for release and um

02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:12,800
we also use like things like dependabot

02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:14,719
which

02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,280
automatically bumps our dependencies

02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:20,000
when new versions are released

02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:20,480
um and every time we commit or merge a

02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,880
pr

02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:23,920
it runs the full build including what

02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:26,719
ariane showed

02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:28,239
for the cr yeah packaging the app and so

02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:30,560
we can test it

02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:33,280
at every build instead of only when it

02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:33,280
gets released

02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:38,159
yeah ever since we haven't made any rc

02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:43,280
or alpha releases anymore

02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:45,360
yeah just stop doing that i just

02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:46,400
next question did you consider using qt

02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:50,960
or qt

02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:53,360
or cute quick um back in the days

02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,840
but then i have to recall going back

02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,679
like 20 years

02:10:54,840 --> 02:11:01,040
um i

02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:03,199
choose gtk because it was

02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,800
well first of all the game was built

02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:07,599
with it which was a

02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:08,880
quite impressive application especially

02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:10,480
20 years ago

02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,679
so i thought if it's good enough for the

02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:16,719
 it's probably good enough for me

02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:20,000
and next to that the license of

02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:23,119
uh well cute is is backed by

02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,760
by a company and

02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:27,360
gtk was purely open source so that was

02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,360
one of the

02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:36,880
more idealistic um

02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:40,960
uh well reasons why i took gtk

02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:44,239
um and i don't know if i would

02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:45,040
have been better off with cute i think

02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:46,880
uh

02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:49,119
qt has a lot more features so that's

02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:54,079
that's definitely uh

02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:54,079
what uh by choosing gtk i missed out on

02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:59,119
i think in general we'd like gtk pretty

02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,639
good though as well so

02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:02,639
i don't think it was like a bad choice

02:12:00,639 --> 02:12:04,560
sorry so yeah yeah well

02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:06,079
and one of the things back in the days

02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,040
i'm just

02:12:06,079 --> 02:12:10,560
trying to recollect my memory a little

02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:13,119
back in the days

02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,960
gtk was quite strong on the language

02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:17,440
bindings

02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:18,880
as far as i recall better than cute at

02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,960
that point

02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,079
so that was because i wanted to develop

02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:25,040
it in python

02:12:22,079 --> 02:12:26,320
um that was one of the the also one of

02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:28,880
the reasons why i took

02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,880
gtk

02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:33,520
so the next question is about where do

02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,320
we keep our signing key for mac and

02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,760
windows

02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:38,159
is it on the build server or do you

02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:43,599
inject it into the build task

02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:46,480
so um the signing key is kept in

02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:48,639
in github i secret so you add a secret

02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:51,520
to your repository and then it's

02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:52,800
that secret's all encrypted and then um

02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:56,639
the build pipeline has

02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:59,679
access to access to the secret um

02:12:56,639 --> 02:13:02,639
if you're doing a build from

02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:03,119
um the main repository so people who are

02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:06,079
maybe

02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:07,199
fork the the repo or creating a pr don't

02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:10,639
have access to the

02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:12,239
the secret um and then depending on what

02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:15,040
type of sign-in key is

02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:16,000
we yeah convert the format from the the

02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:18,639
secret into the right

02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,880
format during the build and and use it

02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:22,560
like that

02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:25,599
actually i don't think i even have

02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:25,599
access to those keys

02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:31,040
no it's it's really a secret then how

02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,040
are you yeah it's

02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:47,119
i also face this issue of split

02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,800
repositories oh that's more like a

02:13:47,119 --> 02:13:51,119
comment okay

02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,119
um

02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:59,599
okay well we will check that out thanks

02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:03,280
for the

02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:03,280
thanks for the suggestion george

02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:08,400
do you plan or are you moving already to

02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:12,560
gtk

02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:16,960
yes um we started moving to

02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:20,239
gtk4 um so far the

02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:27,840
x has been good uh good

02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:27,840
we can keep both gtk 34s

02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,639
to switch only to gtk4 then we

02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:39,840
definitely need

02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:43,040
to well it will be one hell of an

02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:44,719
exercise because we also have to rework

02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:46,320
all the packaging for all the platforms

02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:49,520
all in one shot

02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:52,079
and well our time is precious so it

02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:55,040
rather do it in small steps

02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:56,400
so i'm currently uh we're working on

02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:59,599
getting

02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:02,480
uh support for both gtk 3 and gtk 4

02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:02,480
in the application

02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:07,679
i think arnan's just waiting for my pull

02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:11,119
request review and then we'll have gtk

02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:11,520
for her support right yeah then it's

02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:15,599
kind of

02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:17,599
like it starts and it does something but

02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:22,320
of course still issues but we can fix

02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:25,599
those as we go along

02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:29,520
um what desktop setups do you use

02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:29,520
personally for developing the app

02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:36,320
i'm currently running ubuntu linux

02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:39,040
stripped pretty much all the ubuntu

02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:41,920
stuff um

02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:43,199
and i'm using visual studio code as my

02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:47,520
editor of choice

02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:50,719
nowadays how about you then

02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:53,679
so i'm using susie tumbleweed

02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:54,880
um as yeah converted not that long ago

02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:58,000
maybe like six months ago

02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:01,119
i used to be used ubuntu i like it

02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:04,960
it's really nice um i'd normally use

02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:07,679
pycharm it's probably the the main

02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:10,320
editor i use although sometimes use vim

02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:13,360
and other editors occasionally as well

02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:15,599
um yeah and then i guess

02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:16,480
the rest of the python ecosystem we use

02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,840
as well

02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:19,840
as far as the developer tools

02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:28,719
yeah and i have actually been working on

02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:32,639
this application also for for a long

02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:34,880
time on mac os

02:16:32,639 --> 02:16:36,639
for the last two years i've switched to

02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:40,160
linux but before that

02:16:36,639 --> 02:16:44,080
i helped them by doing it or

02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:44,080
by building it on my quest actually

02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,559
so yeah i think if you couldn't tell

02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:50,160
from the presentation i

02:16:48,559 --> 02:16:52,160
normally handle a lot of the windows

02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:53,359
stuff and already normally handles a lot

02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:55,280
of the mac stuff and then we kind of

02:16:53,359 --> 02:17:01,359
work together on the linux

02:16:55,280 --> 02:17:03,040
thing so

02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:06,080
cool so if there are no more questions

02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:14,160
then i think we can uh

02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:18,399
wrap it up and if i fill up the floor

02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:21,519
yeah thanks everyone thanks a lot

02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:21,519

02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:56,399
about writing native linux desktop apps

can and do

02:30:24,319 --> 02:30:28,640

02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:31,120
linux desktop

02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:32,640
the most famous one is probably the irc

02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,520
client polari

02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:36,720
but there's also the flat seal the

02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:40,160
permissions manager

02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:42,000
and foliate the the ebook reader and

02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:44,080
commit message editor and things like

02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:45,520
that

02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:47,280
a lot of these apps are available on

02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:48,880
flat hub which means that even though

02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:50,560
they use the gnome platform libraries

02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:52,160
they work anywhere flat pack is

02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:54,080
available which is on

02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:55,680
i think pretty much all major linux

02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:59,920
distributions

02:30:55,680 --> 02:31:01,359
um traditionally

02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:02,960
at djs we've been aiming our

02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:04,399
documentation at programmers who have

02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:05,439
already written desktop apps in other

02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:07,520
languages

02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:10,000
other programming languages and want to

02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:13,600
use javascript for

02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:16,240
convenience or rapid development

02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:17,920
because it's faster than writing some

02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:19,760
compiled languages like c

02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:21,520
but one of the reasons we always give

02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:23,760
for even having javascript bindings

02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:25,359
in the first place is so that it's more

02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:27,680
familiar to web developers

02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:28,720
and they can get started quicker on our

02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:32,640
platform

02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:33,920
and uh so this this talk is about

02:31:32,640 --> 02:31:36,880
answering the question is that really

02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:38,880
true i was curious about whether i could

02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:40,399
present a talk from that perspective and

02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:42,720
and this talk is going to be sort of an

02:31:40,399 --> 02:31:44,080
experiment and it's been

02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,680
brewing in the back of my mind for a

02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:48,000
while and in conversations with other

02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:48,000
people

02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:52,640
um a bit about what it is and isn't this

02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,160
talk is for people who know javascript

02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:57,200
from other contexts like

02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:58,640
front-end web development or node.js

02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,479
and are interested in how they could use

02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:02,080
their existing knowledge to write an app

02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:04,319
for the linux desktop

02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:05,680
it'll consist of a walkthrough with some

02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:07,760
digressions here and there

02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:09,520
uh starting with setting up a project

02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:10,399
skeleton and setting up your developer

02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,840
tools

02:32:10,399 --> 02:32:14,160
to things that you might want to be

02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:15,200
aware of while coding to distribution by

02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:19,200
a flat hub

02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:22,720
which i hope there's not too much uh

02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:24,160
overlap with dan and ariane's excellent

02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:26,240
talk that we just listened to before

02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:30,240
mine

02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:31,760
um so one thing to note a few years ago

02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:34,319
this talk would have only applied to the

02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:36,080
gnome desktop because these technologies

02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:38,000
like gjs and gtk they're part of the

02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:39,520
gnome platform but ever since we have

02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,960
flat pack and flat hub

02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:43,439
you can basically write and publish an

02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:46,880
app using whatever desktop platform you

02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:48,319
want and it'll work on any linux desktop

02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:50,479
so the other thing with this talk is is

02:32:48,319 --> 02:32:52,319
a resource that you can go back to later

02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:52,720
and re-read and click on all the links

02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:55,920
in it

02:32:52,720 --> 02:32:59,120
it's uh shared uh

02:32:55,920 --> 02:33:01,280
you know at this uh um

02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:02,720
this url right here you can go there now

02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:04,240
if you want but

02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:07,840
there's no reason to because i'm sharing

02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:07,840
the screen

02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:13,359
anyway this talk is not going to be a

02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:14,479
tutorial on how to code a desktop app

02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:16,399
because there

02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:18,640
are plenty of those already there's a

02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:20,640
link to one in the slides

02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:22,800
another thing this talk is not it is not

02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,680
presented by an experienced web or node

02:33:22,800 --> 02:33:26,000
developer

02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:27,280
i i do know some things about web

02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,720
development in javascript but i'm not

02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,840
really familiar with the latest tools

02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:32,960
and best practices

02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:35,280
uh in in that environment i guess at

02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:38,000
heart i'm a linux desktop programmer

02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,160
and in my day job at igalia i work on

02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,760
javascript engines in browsers

02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:43,920
so like i said at the beginning this is

02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:45,600
an experiment experiment for me

02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:49,120
i might get some of these things wrong

02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:52,319
there could be better ways to do things

02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:54,720
so the cat is telling us to

02:33:52,319 --> 02:33:56,479
get on with it already let's go i'm

02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:58,080
going to talk first about the process of

02:33:56,479 --> 02:33:59,280
setting up your project and how you

02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:02,800
might want to organize

02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:05,120
your development tools before we do that

02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:06,880
we need an idea for an app

02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:08,800
there's a long tradition of having an

02:34:06,880 --> 02:34:11,439
example app in the gtk documentation

02:34:08,800 --> 02:34:14,000
called bloatpad so i stole that name

02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:15,680
unfortunately i did not make up this pun

02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,960
i love making up puns but i didn't make

02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:18,800
up this one

02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:20,000
uh you can see my sketches for the app

02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:22,880
in the background here

02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,720
uh and the the tagline of this app is

02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:26,240
going to be the unnecessary note-taking

02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:27,600
app because really there are plenty of

02:34:26,240 --> 02:34:29,520
good note-taking apps already

02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:32,080
and bloatpad is not going to shatter any

02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:32,080
paradigms

02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:36,000
so the first thing we have to do is have

02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,920
something to start with if you

02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,680
one thing you could do if you're using

02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:41,200
gnome builder as your editor or even if

02:34:39,680 --> 02:34:41,920
you're using a different editor you can

02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:43,200
still

02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:44,960
launch gnome builder and create the

02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,479
project

02:34:44,960 --> 02:34:47,920
the the new project dialog which i've

02:34:46,479 --> 02:34:50,560
shown here allows you to create a

02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:52,720
project skeleton

02:34:50,560 --> 02:34:54,720
and then there's also this gtk js app

02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:56,240
repository that you can use as a

02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,760
starting point

02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:59,439
both of these are quite similar to each

02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,880
other and i think one was probably based

02:34:59,439 --> 02:35:03,040
on the other

02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:04,319
um but both of them give you a project

02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,040
skeleton

02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:08,720
uh the skeleton looks kind of like this

02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:11,280
there's a here's a list

02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:12,880
of what it gives you and i'll come back

02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:14,399
to most of these things at some point in

02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:17,520
the talk

02:35:14,399 --> 02:35:18,960
um the first item on the list a nissan

02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:21,600
build system

02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:23,200
a little bit about build systems uh the

02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:24,720
one included in the project skeleton is

02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:27,280
mison which is

02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:29,359
popular for compiled languages although

02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:30,960
i'd say it's a pretty unfamiliar system

02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:33,520
for people who develop only in

02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:33,520
javascript

02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,160
nissan is great and you'll definitely

02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:39,760
need it if your app is going to include

02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:40,399
any native code that gets imported into

02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,800
javascript

02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:44,160
which many desktop apps eventually end

02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:44,880
up doing well i'm not going to cover

02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:47,840
that

02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:49,760
in this talk so if you start an app from

02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:51,280
scratch i would recommend keeping nissan

02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:53,359
as the build system

02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:56,640
but if you know the javascript ecosystem

02:35:53,359 --> 02:36:00,240
you'll be familiar with yarn

02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:01,920
and you know yarn is similar to npm

02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:03,359
which may be even more familiar

02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,359
but yarn will allow you to easily

02:36:03,359 --> 02:36:07,680
install popular javascript development

02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:09,520
tools like eslint

02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,960
npm would work for this as well so what

02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:13,920
i've done here

02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:14,640
is created a package.json with yarn in

02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,560
it

02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:19,359
and put the snippet into it in order to

02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:21,920
wrap the most important nissan commands

02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:22,720
so if we have this snippet we can just

02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:25,280
do

02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:26,240
yarn start and we'll see the skeleton

02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,680
app run

02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:31,359
it's the one that you get in the

02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:31,359
skeleton is just a hello world app

02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:36,240
so a couple of other things about

02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,560
other tools from the excellent

02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:41,600
javascript tooling ecosystem

02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:42,080
um which is honestly in a lot of ways

02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:44,960
quite

02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:46,399
a lot better than the uh tooling

02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:49,200
ecosystem that we have

02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:50,000
for desktop apps so we should take stuff

02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:54,240
from there that's

02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:58,080
uh that's good and useful um

02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:59,840
blinting prettier is uh i guess

02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:01,200
what they call themselves an opinionated

02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:04,800
code formatter

02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:06,880
uh i guess you can disagree on

02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:08,479
whether it's uh its style is the one you

02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:09,040
prefer or not but in the end for a new

02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:10,479
project

02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,319
just installing it and doing what it

02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:14,720
says is easy and it frees you from ever

02:37:12,319 --> 02:37:16,800
having to worry again about code style

02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:18,640
um and i found it's so good to use

02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:20,399
eslint together with prettier

02:37:18,640 --> 02:37:23,439
in order to catch things like unused

02:37:20,399 --> 02:37:25,200
variables and things like that

02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:27,280
so you can use yarn to install those

02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:30,160
locally and add another snippet to your

02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:32,000
package.json

02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:33,359
typescript is another really prominent

02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,680
part of the

02:37:33,359 --> 02:37:37,760
excellent javascript tooling ecosystem

02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:40,240
and it mostly works on gjs

02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:41,600
thanks to the hard work of evan welsh it

02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:42,800
does require a little bit of manual

02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,560
setup

02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:46,000
uh you can go to this link in the slides

02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:47,600
to find out more

02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,439
you can use it in two ways the simplest

02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:51,120
way is to write regular javascript and

02:37:49,439 --> 02:37:54,160
use the typescript compiler

02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:56,160
at compile time to verify the types this

02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:59,040
is like static analysis

02:37:56,160 --> 02:38:00,640
and this mostly works again requires

02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:02,640
writing some type annotations in doc

02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:04,880
comments occasionally

02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:07,600
and you can also write typescript code

02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:09,600
directly and transpile it to javascript

02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:12,640
that works with ggs2 although i haven't

02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,640
done this myself yet

02:38:13,359 --> 02:38:19,040
um there are

02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:20,640
you know hundreds or thousands more

02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,680
developer tools and build tools in the

02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:23,200
javascript

02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:25,120
ecosystem a lot of that ecosystem

02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:26,960
revolves around bundling

02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:28,240
uh bundlers i think are probably not

02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:29,520
needed when you're writing a native

02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:32,160
desktop app

02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:33,520
the default project skeleton includes

02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:36,560
build code to put all of the

02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,760
javascript sources and data files into a

02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:40,319
g resource bundle

02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:41,520
which is a binary blob that's loaded

02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:43,200
into memory at startup

02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:45,200
and it makes module imports lightning

02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:47,760
fast which is quite different from the

02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:50,399
situation on the web

02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:51,359
so we don't need bundling for that

02:38:50,399 --> 02:38:53,040
reason

02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:55,040
another thing that bundlers do is tree

02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:56,160
shaking and this is really vital in web

02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,439
development where you either have to

02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:58,720
shake the tree to remove library

02:38:57,439 --> 02:38:59,760
functions from your dependencies that

02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,680
you aren't using

02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:03,920
or you have to use thousands of tiny

02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:07,040
dependencies that do only one thing like

02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:08,640
the infamous left pad

02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:10,160
this isn't so vital in our situation

02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:12,240
with a desktop app because

02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:14,319
we have an entire platform in the flat

02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:15,760
pack runtime in the form of c libraries

02:39:14,319 --> 02:39:17,120
that have their own javascript bindings

02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:20,560
and it's there

02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:22,399
whether we use it or not but still

02:39:20,560 --> 02:39:24,560
tree shaking is useful to eliminate dead

02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:27,280
code in your own code base

02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:27,840
but instead of using a bundler there are

02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,240
other

02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:33,200
packages such as find unused exports

02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:33,200
that you could use for that

02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:37,520
another big thing in the in the

02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:40,720
javascript build tool ecosystem is

02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:42,880
minifiers that probably isn't needed

02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:44,960
either for a desktop app

02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:47,760
because with the g resource bundles that

02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:49,840
i mentioned we only do the disk io once

02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:51,120
at startup and there's far less

02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:53,600
javascript code than in a typical

02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:55,920
website that bundles all of its

02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:57,359
dependencies the load time is not really

02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:00,479
a problem

02:39:57,359 --> 02:40:02,160
um you might want to use transpilers

02:40:00,479 --> 02:40:04,240
such as babel

02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:05,520
or other things that implement sort of

02:40:04,240 --> 02:40:07,920
these compile time

02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:09,359
transformations on your code these will

02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:11,200
probably work with a bit of custom

02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:13,840
configuration it depends on what exactly

02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:15,359
you're transfiling

02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:16,880
something like babel you might not need

02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:18,080
it at all because you don't need to

02:40:16,880 --> 02:40:21,200
support old browsers

02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:22,880
and old engines in your app you can just

02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,680
target the latest version in the flat

02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:27,200
pack runtime

02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:29,040
so a lot of the use cases of

02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,479
babel you can just write modern

02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:32,880
javascript by default and you don't need

02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:34,240
to transform anything

02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:36,560
you might use a bundler if you use

02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:39,040
runtime dependencies from npm

02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:40,160
and i'll have more about that later in

02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:45,600
the talk

02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:45,600
but first uh assembling the ui

02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:49,200
i don't know what this cat is doing but

02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:52,560
it's building something but

02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:53,200
yeah you and so tools for constructing a

02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:56,160
ui

02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:58,319
is probably where in the desktop

02:40:56,160 --> 02:41:01,120
platform we lag farthest behind the web

02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:02,800
in developer experience because it's

02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:05,600
very simple the web has html

02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:06,160
and any browser can it's automatically a

02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:08,080
tool for

02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:10,479
displaying it editing it and debugging

02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:14,840
it uh that's that's not the case

02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:17,600
with um desktop ui files

02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:18,640
so in the platform that we are using

02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:23,200
with gtk

02:41:18,640 --> 02:41:26,160
um we have uh there's an xml format for

02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:28,160
for ui description files so this this

02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,720
kind of xml file plays roughly the same

02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:32,000
role

02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:33,600
as html does in the trinity of html css

02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,680
and javascript

02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:38,080
but unlike with html there is another

02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:40,000
alternative that's actually widely used

02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:43,279
this alternative is that you can

02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:47,040
assemble your your ui in code

02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:48,720
if you come from web development

02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:50,800
this sounds kind of ridiculous building

02:41:48,720 --> 02:41:52,240
your ui in code is

02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:53,920
roughly the same thing as building up a

02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:56,399
whole web pages dom

02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:57,200
using document.createelement in your

02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:59,840
code

02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:02,080
that would be really inconvenient and

02:41:59,840 --> 02:42:05,040
it's not really a feasible alternative

02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:06,240
but this is different with djs because

02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,640
um

02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:09,600
you know the gnome platform has a

02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:11,760
heritage from c

02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:13,680
where originally building your ui and

02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:15,439
code was the only option so it's

02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:17,359
the apis to do it are a lot more

02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:18,720
convenient actually

02:42:17,359 --> 02:42:21,120
but you know on the other hand in web

02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,399
development we have tooling like jsx

02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:25,279
which we did not have

02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:26,720
in gjs so there are other alternatives

02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:30,479
which are not open to us

02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:32,960
uh developing a desktop app so

02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:34,080
i guess the big question is uh you know

02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:35,680
do you want to do it

02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:37,680
in an xml file or do you want to do any

02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:39,040
code and here's here's an example of

02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,439
what each option

02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:42,960
looks like a snippet of code doing the

02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:46,080
same thing

02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:47,760
um on the top is the xml file and on the

02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:51,200
bottom is the code

02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:54,479
so you can see the the xml file is quite

02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:56,880
uh quite tedious to write by hand

02:42:54,479 --> 02:42:58,479
um we have you know on the right of the

02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:59,279
screen here we have the glade ui

02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:01,359
designer

02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:03,439
uh which is a program that allows you to

02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:06,800
visually assemble the ui

02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:09,120
and it outputs one of these xml files

02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:11,040
sadly it currently only works for gtk3

02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:13,680
and if you want to use gtk4

02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:15,040
uh you could write the ui file by hand

02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:17,040
or you could

02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:18,800
first build it in gtk3 and then use a

02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,640
tool to do the initial conversion and

02:43:18,800 --> 02:43:23,359
then maintain it by hand

02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:23,840
this is not really a good developer

02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:27,120
story

02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:28,080
but luckily uh work on a replacement is

02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:33,200
already underway

02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:33,200
uh there's actually on several fronts

02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:38,399
but um yeah for now i'd recommend using

02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:42,399
gtk3

02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:44,319
or uh using glade to generate an initial

02:43:42,399 --> 02:43:45,520
file and then converting it to gtk4 and

02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:48,319
then maintaining it

02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,319
later by hand

02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,479
so this is what the front page of the

02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:53,920
app looks like after i built it in glade

02:43:52,479 --> 02:43:56,560
and i use the preview function to

02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:57,840
render it in a window uh so you can see

02:43:56,560 --> 02:44:01,760
here the

02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:04,560
icon is uh it's sort of uh

02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:05,520
it stands out more than we'd like it to

02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:07,200
and

02:44:05,520 --> 02:44:08,960
it's also slightly off-center due to the

02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:10,080
way that the the symbolic icon is

02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:12,160
aligned

02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:14,399
these are things that we can fix with

02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:17,920
css just like we would

02:44:14,399 --> 02:44:19,359
on a web app so you can go back to glade

02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:21,040
and you can give your ui widgets

02:44:19,359 --> 02:44:24,399
particular css classes

02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:25,439
uh or you can add css classes in the xml

02:44:24,399 --> 02:44:27,279
file by hand

02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:29,200
and you can reference them in your app's

02:44:27,279 --> 02:44:30,640
css file

02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:33,040
and there's an example of that here on

02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:35,200
the slide there is a fairly big

02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:37,680
difference between css from the web and

02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:39,760
css in a gtk application

02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:41,520
it's you know it's the same syntax and

02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:42,960
it's the same box model for margin and

02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:44,640
padding and it's largely the same

02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:47,120
properties that you can set

02:44:44,640 --> 02:44:48,560
but the positioning model which

02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:50,319
personally i find the most confusing

02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:54,319
part of css on the web

02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:54,800
it's completely different in gtk and the

02:44:54,319 --> 02:44:58,080
other

02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:59,600
associated ui libraries like lib handy

02:44:58,080 --> 02:45:01,279
they have a much more flexible design

02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:01,680
language of layout containers to work

02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:04,960
with

02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:07,840
in html we just have div and span

02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:09,600
uh and that's all so and you know you

02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:10,880
can use cx css to make one of those into

02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:14,319
a flexbox

02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:16,160
but i mean this but like this

02:45:14,319 --> 02:45:17,680
this richer design language of layout

02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:19,680
containers means that the responsibility

02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:21,279
for positioning things mostly shifts to

02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:24,080
the ui file

02:45:21,279 --> 02:45:25,040
so there's no uh you know position

02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:28,880
absolute or

02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:31,840
float left in the css that we have

02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:33,200
on the desktop platform so here's what

02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:35,760
that same preview looks like

02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:36,960
when i applied that css to it so now you

02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:39,040
can see the icon isn't quite so

02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:40,720
prominent and it's got a shadow now

02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:42,160
and it's got these extra pixels of

02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:44,800
padding which visually aligns it better

02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:44,800
with the button

02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:51,040
so now that's done the ui looks

02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:52,800
mostly like we want it to uh we have a

02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:54,319
base on which to build

02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:56,160
and it should be somewhat familiar if

02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:58,240
you're coming from a

02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:59,439
web app background so now it's time to

02:45:58,240 --> 02:46:02,640
write some code

02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:03,359
uh cat does not want to write some code

02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:05,600
but you know

02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:06,640
i do so i'll show you some of the things

02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:09,120
that you might need to know

02:46:06,640 --> 02:46:10,000
about the gnome developer platform and

02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:12,479
i'll compare it to things

02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:14,160
that might be familiar for node.js

02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:16,800
developers

02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:19,279
uh the most important thing is that we

02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:22,000
have api documentation on

02:46:19,279 --> 02:46:23,600
on this address here in the slides this

02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:26,319
is for

02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:27,200
the gnome platform and it's it's for the

02:46:26,319 --> 02:46:29,840
javascript

02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:32,319
binding version of it um one thing that

02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:33,760
might not be familiar if you're

02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:35,760
coming from a node background if you're

02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:39,520
browsing the api you notice the sections

02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:42,800
for properties and signals

02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:45,760
these exist because the ui elements

02:46:42,800 --> 02:46:47,279
inherit from gtk widget

02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:49,120
and that's a class that provides things

02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:50,399
such as properties signals and css

02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:52,840
element names

02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:53,920
a ptk widget in

02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:55,439
[Music]

02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:59,200
this platform plays roughly the same

02:46:55,439 --> 02:47:01,200
role as a dom element in html

02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:04,080
you'll find that i guess the gtk widget

02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:07,920
relies on object orientation much more

02:47:04,080 --> 02:47:09,439
uh you know dom elements have an

02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:11,680
inheritance hierarchy too

02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:13,760
but for a lot of applications you don't

02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:17,920
even need to care about that

02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:20,319
for dtk widgets you kind of do um

02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:22,319
and the interesting thing that's

02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:23,680
different from the web platform is gtk

02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:26,560
widget inherits from

02:47:23,680 --> 02:47:28,000
g object.object which actually that's

02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:29,520
the class that provides the signals of

02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,640
properties functionality

02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:33,520
so even things like files and output

02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:36,960
streams

02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:38,399
and uh um

02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:40,319
and network requests they have

02:47:38,399 --> 02:47:43,279
properties and signals

02:47:40,319 --> 02:47:45,040
uh and this is kind of like node where a

02:47:43,279 --> 02:47:47,359
lot of objects are uh

02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:48,800
inherit from event emitter but it's not

02:47:47,359 --> 02:47:53,120
the case for everything

02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:56,560
um in you know in gjs really everything

02:47:53,120 --> 02:48:01,040
has properties and signals almost

02:47:56,560 --> 02:48:03,520
um there's es modules

02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:04,640
this is something new that you uh you

02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:07,120
might not realize it works

02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:08,160
natively in gjs this is new in the

02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:10,640
latest

02:48:08,160 --> 02:48:11,359
version of the flat pack runtime we have

02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:13,120
uh you can

02:48:11,359 --> 02:48:15,359
just import es modules so this is

02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:18,800
another initiative thanks to

02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:20,319
uh evan welsh um this is the thing that

02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:21,680
for the web platform you have to use

02:48:20,319 --> 02:48:23,439
bundlers for a lot of the times because

02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:24,640
you can't count on users browsers being

02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:27,680
able to

02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:28,080
uh support es modules um but we support

02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:31,520
them

02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:34,160
natively you can just use them um

02:48:31,520 --> 02:48:35,840
another thing is about uh async

02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:38,880
operations

02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:40,240
uh in the gnome platforms of the what we

02:48:38,880 --> 02:48:43,279
have in gjs

02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:45,439
all the i o is cancelable as well which

02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:47,760
is

02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:51,120
something that you know node

02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:53,279
asynchronous io doesn't always have

02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:55,040
in gjs it works using callback style but

02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:56,399
we have some experimental support for

02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:58,479
promise style

02:48:56,399 --> 02:48:59,840
and you can opt into it for each method

02:48:58,479 --> 02:49:02,800
uh with this

02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:04,160
uh gio.promisify thing at the start of

02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:07,040
your program

02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:08,720
um that sort of signifies that you want

02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:09,520
to use the experimental support for that

02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,800
method

02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:12,720
once you've done that you then you can

02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:14,800
use it like in the code example down at

02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:16,319
the bottom with a weight

02:49:14,800 --> 02:49:18,000
this uh experimental support was

02:49:16,319 --> 02:49:20,720
actually done by an outreach intern

02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:22,319
obviously a couple of years ago and we

02:49:20,720 --> 02:49:23,760
have another outreachy internship that's

02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:24,840
still in the application period for

02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:28,080
working on

02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:30,000
uh making this support uh

02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:31,520
just part of the platform and not

02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:34,080
experimental anymore

02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:36,720
so look out for improvements uh here

02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:36,720
coming soon

02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:45,279
um there are lots of

02:49:42,080 --> 02:49:47,120
runtime libraries that if you're coming

02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:48,319
from a web or node background you might

02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:51,520
want to use

02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:52,080
uh the one of these libraries from the

02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,479
node

02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:59,600
ecosystem um most desktop apps don't

02:49:56,479 --> 02:50:01,439
end up doing this because there's a lot

02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:04,000
in the platform already but in many

02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:05,840
cases it is actually possible to do this

02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:07,200
um so the first thing you want to do

02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:08,000
like it may or may not work so the first

02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:10,560
thing you want to do is check

02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:11,359
if you actually need uh to depend on

02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:14,160
this library

02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:15,279
in some cases you really don't it you

02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:16,880
know a library might be something that

02:50:15,279 --> 02:50:17,760
the grown platform already provides in

02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:21,040
another way like

02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,080
like network i o or uh it might be a

02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:24,720
dependency

02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:26,479
that sort of abstracts over different

02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:28,880
versions of browsers

02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:30,399
and you might not need that because in

02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:33,200
the desktop platform you can target

02:50:30,399 --> 02:50:35,680
modern javascript

02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:37,520
if you do need the library you start by

02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:38,720
checking if it has any node dependencies

02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:40,960
and check if it ships

02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:42,479
an es module entry point so if it

02:50:40,960 --> 02:50:44,240
doesn't have any node dependencies and

02:50:42,479 --> 02:50:45,840
if there's an es module great

02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:47,760
you can probably just copy that module

02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:49,200
into your sources import it directly and

02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:52,000
it'll work

02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:52,479
if there's not it might ship a browser

02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,520
bundle

02:50:52,479 --> 02:50:57,120
which will probably already work

02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:59,040
some modules do that and if it doesn't

02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:00,960
have that you can build your own bundle

02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:03,279
with a tool called browserify that's

02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:05,760
available in npm

02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:06,960
uh so here's how to do this browserify

02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:10,240
trick you

02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:14,000
add this dash s option and

02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:16,880
uh that builds a umd module and umd is

02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:18,800
stands for universal module definition i

02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:20,880
think

02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:22,479
you can import the umd module and it has

02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:24,720
a side effect which is to install the

02:51:22,479 --> 02:51:28,080
library as a global object

02:51:24,720 --> 02:51:30,240
um so yeah the global object's

02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:31,200
kind of growth this is the best way that

02:51:30,240 --> 02:51:34,160
i've found to do this

02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:36,000
so far it's not ideal uh so it would be

02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:37,840
really cool if somebody would write a

02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,600
rollup plugin for gjs modules or

02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:43,359
something

02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:45,439
rollup is another bundler tool from the

02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:46,880
node ecosystem there might be a better

02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:48,399
way that already exists that i haven't

02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:50,880
found yet

02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:52,319
but in the examples that i'll show in a

02:51:50,880 --> 02:51:55,040
minute i'm going to

02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:55,040
use this trick

02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:01,279
so as an experiment i decided to take a

02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:04,000
look at the top five dependent upon

02:52:01,279 --> 02:52:06,640
npm libraries there's a link here with

02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:08,399
somebody who

02:52:06,640 --> 02:52:10,319
you know compiles and updates this list

02:52:08,399 --> 02:52:12,880
by submetric let's see if i could make

02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:15,359
them work in the gjs app

02:52:12,880 --> 02:52:16,640
so the top of the list is lowdash it's a

02:52:15,359 --> 02:52:20,560
very popular

02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:22,319
utility library first of all

02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:23,520
consider if you really need it many of

02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:25,200
the functions that it provides are

02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:27,359
actually no longer necessary if you can

02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:29,520
target modern javascript

02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:31,120
so the example here with low

02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:32,960
dash.defaults it can actually be

02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:34,160
replaced with object destructuring which

02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:38,160
is

02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:40,960
a newer javascript language feature

02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:43,120
other things you might still need it for

02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:43,920
lowdash provides an es module with no

02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:46,479
dependencies

02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:48,080
in the low dash es package so you can

02:52:46,479 --> 02:52:49,920
copy this file from

02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:52,800
this package into your source directory

02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:56,240
and import it into your code

02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:57,279
and then it just works uh number two on

02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:59,359
the list is chalk

02:52:57,279 --> 02:53:01,279
that's a popular library for printing nc

02:52:59,359 --> 02:53:03,359
color codes to the terminal

02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:06,160
uh and that does not ship a browser

02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:07,520
bundle it does ship an es module but it

02:53:06,160 --> 02:53:09,040
imports other modules that need node

02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:10,479
module resolution so we can't use it

02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:12,960
directly either

02:53:10,479 --> 02:53:15,359
so for this one i used the browser if i

02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:17,120
trick to build a umd bundle

02:53:15,359 --> 02:53:18,720
um and then i also found that i needed

02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:21,760
to make one edit in that bundle

02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:24,000
because uh the

02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:26,000
browser bundle that browserify generates

02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:27,600
by default the ansi colors were disabled

02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,319
because browsers mostly don't support

02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:30,399
them

02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:33,680
so i had to make this one edit and after

02:53:30,399 --> 02:53:33,680
that it worked

02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:38,080
number three on the list is request

02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:41,359
which is a library

02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:42,240
for network i o it's a very popular

02:53:41,359 --> 02:53:43,920
library but

02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:45,359
but it's been moved to maintenance mode

02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:47,760
because there are better ways to do

02:53:45,359 --> 02:53:50,720
requests in modern javascript

02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:52,160
um and there is actually one in the

02:53:50,720 --> 02:53:54,160
gnome platform uh

02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:55,600
lib soup is the known platform's network

02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:57,920
i o library

02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:59,439
uh and so you know i'd recommend using

02:53:57,920 --> 02:54:02,479
that it integrates with

02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:05,200
uh the main loop uh

02:54:02,479 --> 02:54:06,080
and in the upcoming libsub3 there will

02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:08,080
be an api that

02:54:06,080 --> 02:54:09,359
will integrate even better with await in

02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:12,560
javascript

02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:15,920
um so i've i've shown like

02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:17,840
uh the code sample that's on requests

02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:20,240
website and another

02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:22,160
uh the bottom code sample is doing the

02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:26,080
same thing but with libsub

02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:27,920
um so you know despite request being one

02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:30,720
of the most dependent upon modules

02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:34,160
in the web ecosystem in desktop app code

02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:35,760
you might as well use libsub

02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:37,520
number four on the list of popular

02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:39,760
modules was commander this is a library

02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:43,040
for parsing command line options

02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:44,479
um this one it needs the same trick with

02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:47,600
browserify that we did with

02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:48,000
uh with number two chalk but yeah i

02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:49,439
didn't

02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,960
didn't even have to edit anything in

02:54:49,439 --> 02:54:52,560
this case the generated bundle just

02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:54,960
worked

02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:57,040
uh number five on the list was react uh

02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:58,560
so this is a browser-specific thing

02:54:57,040 --> 02:55:00,720
it doesn't really apply to writing

02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:02,240
desktop apps because it's a library for

02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:05,840
making user interfaces

02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:08,479
specifically in the html dom

02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:09,920
although there is a library react native

02:55:08,479 --> 02:55:11,279
which abstracts over different mobile

02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:13,680
platforms and it allows you to write

02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:15,840
react apps

02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:17,200
for ios and android and it would be

02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:18,560
really cool if this worked for the linux

02:55:17,200 --> 02:55:21,279
desktop as well but i think that would

02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:21,279
be a lot of work

02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:26,960
anyway i'm going to skip the part of

02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:29,120
writing the actual code

02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:30,640
of bloatpad and i've linked to the code

02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:32,160
in my slides here so you can click on it

02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:37,040
later if you're interested

02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:42,800
to see how i did it but i'm going to um

02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:46,560
go and share uh the actual app running

02:55:42,800 --> 02:55:48,399
so i really hope that i can

02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:50,399
uh share a different window without

02:55:48,399 --> 02:55:52,640
breaking my uh

02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:52,640
um

02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:56,640
without breaking my screen share for the

02:55:54,880 --> 02:55:59,840
rest of the presentation let's let's see

02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:59,840
if that works

02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:04,080
uh can everybody see the app

02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:18,880
yes um

02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:21,120
okay so you know i'm going to

02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:22,160
uh create a note let's see what's my

02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:26,000
to-do list

02:56:22,160 --> 02:56:28,560
for may 13th

02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,840
uh i'm a really bad typist under

02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:32,560
pressure while i'm giving a talk at the

02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:37,160
same time so excuse my typos

02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:41,840
um let's see uh

02:56:37,160 --> 02:56:41,840
praise and talk

02:56:46,800 --> 02:56:53,120
and then after that relax uh

02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:55,359
you go back uh the

02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:56,960
notice now in a list of notes i can add

02:56:55,359 --> 02:57:00,680
another note

02:56:56,960 --> 02:57:02,240
other ideas for my app

02:57:00,680 --> 02:57:08,399
[Music]

02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:11,840
notepad for cats

02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:15,120
you can go back and edit the

02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:16,560
notes and uh you know

02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:18,720
there's a couple of other features that

02:57:16,560 --> 02:57:20,399
you get for free or almost for free here

02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:21,200
you can really easily make an about

02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:24,800
dialogue

02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:29,120
using platform apis you get

02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:29,120
keyboard shortcuts help

02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:37,790
and that's it for the for the app

02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:41,099
if i can go back to

02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:41,099
[Music]

02:57:41,359 --> 02:57:51,840
sharing the talk

02:57:52,399 --> 02:57:55,760
okay it looks like it's sharing on my

02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:00,479
end

02:57:55,760 --> 02:58:04,479
um so hope these are showing

02:58:00,479 --> 02:58:07,279
anyway uh so now the app is done um

02:58:04,479 --> 02:58:08,800
you have to actually get users so this

02:58:07,279 --> 02:58:10,800
is also

02:58:08,800 --> 02:58:12,240
uh like the way that we do this with

02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:14,080
desktop apps is quite different from the

02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:17,520
way you do it with a web app

02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:19,920
um this is actually one place

02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:22,000
where the desktop platform really has

02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:24,960
the potential to outshine the web

02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,399
because it can actually be a lot easier

02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:28,319
with desktop apps

02:58:26,399 --> 02:58:30,000
when you have a desktop app once your

02:58:28,319 --> 02:58:31,040
user downloads it they don't need to

02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,640
keep

02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:34,399
using your bandwidths and using your

02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:35,920
computing resources when they run it so

02:58:34,399 --> 02:58:38,080
you don't need to run a server that has

02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:39,359
to scale really

02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:41,200
you know really hard with the number of

02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:42,399
users and

02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,800
you know what most people do is pay

02:58:42,399 --> 02:58:46,399
somebody else to do that

02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:48,080
you know your user downloads the app and

02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:49,840
they run it on their computer and you

02:58:48,080 --> 02:58:51,680
can concentrate on

02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:53,920
answering bug reports like this cat is

02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,920
doing

02:58:54,319 --> 02:58:59,200
um so you know i'll be talking about

02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:02,399
building the app as a flat pack and

02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:02,399
distributing it on flat hub

02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:05,840
there are certain requirements that you

02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:07,680
have to meet in order to distribute your

02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:09,120
app on flat top but luckily the project

02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:11,120
skeleton that we generated

02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:12,640
early in the talk it meets these

02:59:11,120 --> 02:59:15,439
requirements there are only a few things

02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:18,399
that we need to fill in

02:59:15,439 --> 02:59:20,240
one thing that will be kind of

02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:22,319
unfamiliar to

02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:24,640
people coming from the web platform is

02:59:22,319 --> 02:59:25,600
the app stream meta info file this is a

02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:27,760
kind of

02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:29,439
manifest that provides the description

02:59:27,760 --> 02:59:30,160
that users see when they go to flat hub

02:59:29,439 --> 02:59:31,439
like i've

02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:33,840
you know taken a screenshot of that here

02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:37,200
on the right and users also see this

02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:38,880
information in their updater application

02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:40,880
so flat hub requires you to have one of

02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:41,680
these because it ensures a good

02:59:40,880 --> 02:59:43,200
experience for

02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:45,840
users installing and updating the

02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:47,520
software that i've linked to

02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:50,000
a description of the file format here in

02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:50,000
the slides

02:59:50,080 --> 02:59:53,600
but you don't have to write it from

02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:55,279
scratch there's a generator

02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:57,040
there's another link here to get you

02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:58,399
started you go to this

02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:59,920
you click on this link you fill out the

02:59:58,399 --> 03:00:00,880
answers to a few questions about your

02:59:59,920 --> 03:00:03,200
app

03:00:00,880 --> 03:00:04,560
and the result of that process can

03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:05,680
actually just replace the file that was

03:00:04,560 --> 03:00:06,720
generated along with the project

03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:10,080
skeleton

03:00:06,720 --> 03:00:12,319
you can just copy and paste it in um

03:00:10,080 --> 03:00:13,600
you will need screenshots for flat hub

03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:15,200
these screenshots are linked in this

03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:15,840
manifest so you have to host those

03:00:15,200 --> 03:00:18,880
somewhere

03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:20,319
usually in your apps git repository

03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:23,600
and then for flat hub you also have to

03:00:20,319 --> 03:00:25,520
have a content rating in this manifest

03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:27,040
and so they use the scale given by the

03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:29,120
open age rating service

03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:30,720
and that also has a handy generator it's

03:00:29,120 --> 03:00:32,319
also linked in this slide

03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:34,479
you can answer questions about your app

03:00:32,319 --> 03:00:35,600
and it spits out a rating that you can

03:00:34,479 --> 03:00:39,840
download

03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:39,840
and just paste into your file

03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:43,439
another file where we have to fill in

03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:46,399
some blanks is the desktop file and so

03:00:43,439 --> 03:00:46,399
this one is used

03:00:46,479 --> 03:00:50,080
not at the point of distribution but

03:00:48,479 --> 03:00:51,200
this is used by the user's desktop

03:00:50,080 --> 03:00:53,600
environment to

03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:55,680
determine how to display your app like

03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:57,680
where to put it in the applications menu

03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:59,040
if there is such a thing in that user's

03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:02,560
desktop

03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:02,960
uh and for the the i guess for the

03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:05,279
things

03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:06,720
that the one was already generated uh in

03:01:05,279 --> 03:01:09,040
our project skeleton

03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:11,920
we really only have to fill in the

03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:13,359
comments and categories fields

03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:15,040
but i've included a link to the

03:01:13,359 --> 03:01:16,960
description of this file format in case

03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:18,880
you want to know what all the fields are

03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:20,560
and then there's a list of categories

03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:22,080
that you can pick from but the field is

03:01:20,560 --> 03:01:25,200
free form so you can pick up

03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:28,160
you can pick any that apply

03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:28,160
or add new ones

03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:33,439
you'll need an icon the icon that i've

03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:35,200
shown here is the placeholder icon that

03:01:33,439 --> 03:01:36,880
you get from the app skeleton that's

03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:38,240
generated

03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:40,560
i'm not going to go into the whole

03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:42,960
process of designing an icon but

03:01:40,560 --> 03:01:45,600
one of the gnome designers who i believe

03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:46,880
gave a talk this morning

03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:49,120
unfortunately didn't see it because it

03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:50,240
was at like 2 30 in the morning my time

03:01:49,120 --> 03:01:51,840
but

03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:54,240
there's a very nice blog post on how to

03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:54,240
do this

03:01:55,040 --> 03:02:00,720
um and that's all for submitting your

03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:02,640
app to flat hub

03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:04,479
you know there's instructions for

03:02:02,640 --> 03:02:06,160
actually doing the submission that

03:02:04,479 --> 03:02:08,240
the submission works as a github pull

03:02:06,160 --> 03:02:09,680
request and once the pull request is

03:02:08,240 --> 03:02:11,600
accepted you've pretty much taken care

03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:12,640
of your distribution channel and all you

03:02:11,600 --> 03:02:16,479
have to do now is fix

03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:16,479
bugs and push updates whenever you do

03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:22,080
hopefully once your app is released and

03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:22,560
you get users something that you might

03:02:22,080 --> 03:02:25,200
want to do

03:02:22,560 --> 03:02:27,920
is translate your ui into the languages

03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:29,359
that your users speak

03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:31,680
so what you need to do this is a

03:02:29,359 --> 03:02:34,000
translation framework and the platform

03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:35,200
heavily prefers one that comes built in

03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,800
and it's called get text

03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:38,399
it's been around a really long time and

03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:39,680
it's quite well supported in all kinds

03:02:38,399 --> 03:02:41,520
of tools

03:02:39,680 --> 03:02:43,359
uh it's under the you know the file

03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,920
format used in get text is understood by

03:02:43,359 --> 03:02:46,560
a lot of

03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:48,640
existing tools including translation

03:02:46,560 --> 03:02:50,479
websites such as trans effects

03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:52,479
or you can get a program such as g

03:02:50,479 --> 03:02:53,760
translator or po edit and kick off the

03:02:52,479 --> 03:02:55,359
process by

03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:57,520
translating the ui yourself into a

03:02:55,359 --> 03:03:01,120
language that you speak

03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:03,680
it's my experience having written an app

03:03:01,120 --> 03:03:05,520
not talking about blogpad here but once

03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:07,120
your app gets some users translators are

03:03:05,520 --> 03:03:09,439
some of the easiest volunteers to find

03:03:07,120 --> 03:03:10,720
if you make it easy for them

03:03:09,439 --> 03:03:12,080
it's a really low threshold way for

03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:13,439
people to contribute they don't have to

03:03:12,080 --> 03:03:14,960
know how to program

03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:17,439
it's really nice for them if they can

03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:20,880
just go to a website or

03:03:17,439 --> 03:03:23,600
download some program and and you know

03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:24,880
translate the ui messages into their own

03:03:23,600 --> 03:03:27,840
language

03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:29,120
it's it's quite low threshold low

03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:31,840
friction

03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:34,160
uh you've just got to make it possible

03:03:31,840 --> 03:03:34,160
for them

03:03:34,479 --> 03:03:38,560
so uh we've gotten to the end i think

03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:40,080
the conclusion is that it's quite

03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:41,760
possible if you know javascript from

03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:44,479
some other context to use that knowledge

03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:47,680
to develop apps for the linux desktop

03:03:44,479 --> 03:03:51,200
some things might be really familiar

03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:52,960
to js developers

03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:54,319
some things about the desktop platform

03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:55,439
might be even better like

03:03:54,319 --> 03:03:56,640
you're being able to target one

03:03:55,439 --> 03:03:57,920
environment instead of a million

03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:59,359
different browsers

03:03:57,920 --> 03:04:01,760
other things might be worse or more

03:03:59,359 --> 03:04:03,200
confusing like the situation with xml ui

03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:04,960
files

03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:06,880
so what i'm advocating for us as desktop

03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:08,560
developers is to learn more about

03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:10,319
web and node development and try to

03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:12,160
reduce friction for this really large

03:04:10,319 --> 03:04:13,520
group of developers

03:04:12,160 --> 03:04:15,040
but you know not everything should be

03:04:13,520 --> 03:04:18,640
copied or not everything is even going

03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:20,160
to be applicable to desktop development

03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:22,399
and that was my experiment i hope it was

03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:25,040
useful to someone uh because that

03:04:22,399 --> 03:04:25,920
means that it was successful i'd like to

03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:28,800
take questions

03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:30,319
um i may have wasted the question time

03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:32,319
with the uh

03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:34,840
um showing the slides in the beginning

03:04:32,319 --> 03:04:37,120
but uh yeah i wonder if there's a bit of

03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:37,760
uh if you go ahead and stop your screen

03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:40,160
share there

03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:40,960
are questions in the shared notes that

03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:43,600
you can

03:04:40,960 --> 03:04:45,760
answer uh because this is the last

03:04:43,600 --> 03:04:46,080
session of the day it's okay if we run a

03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:48,240
little

03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:49,600
a couple minutes longer but essentially

03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:50,000
you have three minutes left of your

03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:54,240
formal

03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:56,080
time slot okay uh

03:04:54,240 --> 03:04:58,080
the first question is isn't glade ui

03:04:56,080 --> 03:05:01,680
deprecated for creating uis

03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:01,680
uh i don't think it is

03:05:02,080 --> 03:05:09,920
um it's uh still actively maintained for

03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:11,279
gtk3 uis and uh

03:05:09,920 --> 03:05:14,880
you know the maintainer of glade is

03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:17,359
working on reversion for gtk4

03:05:14,880 --> 03:05:19,040
i hope that answers the question a

03:05:17,359 --> 03:05:21,359
second question

03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:25,120
is uh for maintenance which is better

03:05:21,359 --> 03:05:25,120
xml ui files or code

03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:33,200
it really depends

03:05:28,720 --> 03:05:38,560
on your preference uh

03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:41,120
i think you know personally i prefer

03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:42,160
using xml files and making changes when

03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:45,840
i need to make changes

03:05:42,160 --> 03:05:47,120
in glade i know lots of other people who

03:05:45,840 --> 03:05:50,960
would really prefer code

03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:50,960
so it's uh it's up to you

03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:58,840
um which language is djs built upon

03:05:55,200 --> 03:06:02,720
um djs is

03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:04,800
uh embedded in it is a copy of

03:06:02,720 --> 03:06:06,319
uh the spider monkey javascript engine

03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:08,080
which is the same

03:06:06,319 --> 03:06:11,120
engine that's used in the firefox

03:06:08,080 --> 03:06:14,160
browser uh and so it's

03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:17,600
uh yeah it's javascript

03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:19,520
uh plus the layer that uh

03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:20,800
you know that dynamically generates the

03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:22,960
bindings between

03:06:20,800 --> 03:06:26,319
these platform libraries and what the

03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:26,319
code that people write in javascript

03:06:26,800 --> 03:06:30,319
um is there an easy way to add a webview

03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:33,920
browser widget

03:06:30,319 --> 03:06:35,439
uh it's not a stupid question at all

03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:36,560
the person who asked this said sorry for

03:06:35,439 --> 03:06:37,680
the stupid question but it's not a

03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:40,960
stupid question

03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:43,279
um yes there is there's a platform

03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:47,279
library called webkit gtk

03:06:43,279 --> 03:06:48,319
and that uh yeah that library provides a

03:06:47,279 --> 03:06:52,240
browser widget

03:06:48,319 --> 03:06:54,479
and it's i believe it is part of the

03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:55,840
flat pack runtime so you already get

03:06:54,479 --> 03:06:58,880
that library for free you don't even

03:06:55,840 --> 03:06:58,880
need an extra dependency

03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:06,319
um there's actually an example

03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:08,160
in the examples directory in the ggs

03:07:06,319 --> 03:07:08,560
repository i can link to it after the

03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:12,479
talk

03:07:08,560 --> 03:07:15,279
in the chat maybe um

03:07:12,479 --> 03:07:17,439
question five can gjs be used cross

03:07:15,279 --> 03:07:19,120
platform linux windows mac android and

03:07:17,439 --> 03:07:23,040
ios

03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:26,720
uh the answer is uh sort of

03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:31,040
it works on linux and mac

03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:33,680
uh i have understood that it works

03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:35,120
on windows although i don't know how

03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:37,920
easy the developer story

03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:39,840
is for writing an app in it and and

03:07:37,920 --> 03:07:43,200
packaging it on windows

03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:46,160
uh i would sincerely doubt

03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:48,640
that you could write an android or ios

03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:48,640
app with it

03:07:49,359 --> 03:07:54,560
but you know who knows that that might

03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:54,560
be possible one day

03:07:55,680 --> 03:08:00,479
uh how does djs compare to electron

03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:03,520
performance and memory wise

03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:07,840
um i think

03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:07,840
that uh

03:08:08,240 --> 03:08:14,240
yeah i don't have uh

03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:14,800
numbers at my fingertips right now but

03:08:14,240 --> 03:08:17,200
uh

03:08:14,800 --> 03:08:18,479
electron is basically an embedded uh

03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:21,120
webview widget

03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:22,080
so anytime you embed a webview widget uh

03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:24,479
your

03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:26,479
um performance is going to go down a bit

03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:30,399
and your memory is going to go up a bit

03:08:26,479 --> 03:08:32,080
uh because like the web is

03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:34,000
you know web is a huge platform

03:08:32,080 --> 03:08:36,640
embedding a webview widget

03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:38,800
um it's sort of necessarily going to

03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:42,399
increase the resources that you use

03:08:38,800 --> 03:08:44,640
so uh you know the

03:08:42,399 --> 03:08:46,880
anecdotal evidence is that electron apps

03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:49,200
uh

03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:50,560
you know they depending on what

03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:54,800
dependencies you use

03:08:50,560 --> 03:09:00,840
uh you know they can use like easily 350

03:08:54,800 --> 03:09:03,359
uh um megabytes of memory or something

03:09:00,840 --> 03:09:05,200
uh you know still the answer depends on

03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:07,760
on what dependencies you're using but

03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:09,040
generally native desktop apps are going

03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:13,520
to be

03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:13,520
much more lightweight than that and uh

03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:17,359
you know if you wrote it in a compiled

03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:17,920
language it would be even more

03:09:17,359 --> 03:09:20,479
lightweight

03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:22,399
but the interpreted languages that you

03:09:20,479 --> 03:09:26,160
can use for writing desktop apps like

03:09:22,399 --> 03:09:27,520
uh gjs python and stuff like that

03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:29,279
uh they are generally going to be

03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:31,120
lighter than uh using an embedded

03:09:29,279 --> 03:09:33,439
browser

03:09:31,120 --> 03:09:33,439
um

03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:39,439
6.1 is it native code or is it js

03:09:38,399 --> 03:09:42,000
runtime

03:09:39,439 --> 03:09:44,239
gjs native code for gui elements and js

03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:47,680
for my logic written in js

03:09:44,239 --> 03:09:51,040
uh so

03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:54,239
the the setup that we have here

03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:56,080
in in gjs um like you're running a

03:09:54,239 --> 03:09:59,120
javascript interpreter and that

03:09:56,080 --> 03:10:02,720
is falling into native code

03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:06,399
uh so

03:10:02,720 --> 03:10:07,040
i guess i don't know if that answered

03:10:06,399 --> 03:10:10,880
the question

03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:13,040
um so yeah like all of the

03:10:10,880 --> 03:10:16,000
uh all of the code that you don't write

03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:19,680
is native code let me put it that way

03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:20,720
um can this djs be easily packed for

03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:24,840
windows and mac

03:10:20,720 --> 03:10:27,600
uh i guess

03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:29,120
the the answer depends on what you uh

03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:34,080
what you call easily

03:10:29,120 --> 03:10:37,439
um for mac it's not too hard for windows

03:10:34,080 --> 03:10:40,479
i don't have experience doing it so

03:10:37,439 --> 03:10:43,600
somebody else might have to answer that

03:10:40,479 --> 03:10:45,920
um question 8 is there http 2 support in

03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:49,920
gjs and is it transparent

03:10:45,920 --> 03:10:52,160
uh so djs itself doesn't have

03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:54,399
any http support because that's provided

03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:58,000
by the gnome platform

03:10:54,399 --> 03:11:01,200
so lib soup has has that i believe that

03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:04,000
http 2 support appeared in libsub 3

03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:05,200
which was released very recently i don't

03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,160
know if it's in the

03:11:05,200 --> 03:11:09,040
current version of the uh flat pack

03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:10,479
runtime or

03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:12,880
it's going to be in the next version i'd

03:11:10,479 --> 03:11:15,760
have to look that up

03:11:12,880 --> 03:11:18,560
um question nine is webkit gtk

03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:22,080
cross-platform as well like available in

03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:25,040
windows and mac as well uh

03:11:22,080 --> 03:11:27,680
i believe it is available in mac uh

03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:30,800
windows i am not sure

03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:32,800
um question 10

03:11:30,800 --> 03:11:34,840
will it have good compatibility with

03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:38,479
cute

03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:42,800
uh i'm not sure if does

03:11:38,479 --> 03:11:42,800
it mean gjs in this case um

03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:50,319
but if yeah if it means uh

03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:50,720
dji okay yes the questioner is writing

03:11:50,319 --> 03:11:52,640
uh

03:11:50,720 --> 03:11:54,160
as we speak so does djs have good

03:11:52,640 --> 03:11:54,960
compatibility with respect to ui with

03:11:54,160 --> 03:11:58,560
cute

03:11:54,960 --> 03:12:01,600
uh it doesn't um

03:11:58,560 --> 03:12:05,359
because you know uh

03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:06,319
cute has other uh you know other ways to

03:12:05,359 --> 03:12:09,359
write

03:12:06,319 --> 03:12:10,880
um you know other language bindings gjs

03:12:09,359 --> 03:12:12,000
is for implementing language bindings

03:12:10,880 --> 03:12:16,239
that are based on g

03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:18,640
object so

03:12:16,239 --> 03:12:19,680
yeah you can you can use c libraries but

03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:22,000
they have to be

03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:22,960
uh written in the form of g objects and

03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:25,040
that's what

03:12:22,960 --> 03:12:27,680
ggs can sort of dynamically generate

03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:27,680
bindings for

03:12:28,479 --> 03:12:35,279
um there's a question

03:12:32,399 --> 03:12:36,160
11 appearing let's make that the last

03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:40,239
one

03:12:36,160 --> 03:12:44,160
the rust story um

03:12:40,239 --> 03:12:46,960
i guess if you want to

03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:48,960
write part of you know the if you want

03:12:46,960 --> 03:12:52,239
to write native code in your app

03:12:48,960 --> 03:12:55,680
uh with rust um you

03:12:52,239 --> 03:12:56,080
can you know you you can write it in the

03:12:55,680 --> 03:12:58,720
form

03:12:56,080 --> 03:13:00,080
of uh g object introspection library and

03:12:58,720 --> 03:13:03,200
then you can import that library

03:13:00,080 --> 03:13:06,880
in gjs i haven't that's not something

03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:06,880
that i've done myself in any of my code

03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:10,880
but i know that it's possible

03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:16,640
yeah so let's um

03:13:15,279 --> 03:13:19,359
let's call that the last question

03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:20,399
because i otherwise i'm going over time

03:13:19,359 --> 03:13:22,720
here

03:13:20,399 --> 03:13:24,640
um and before i go i'd like to thank

03:13:22,720 --> 03:13:26,239

and you can find the code for the uh

03:13:42,720 --> 03:13:45,840
fake app that i wrote

03:13:43,760 --> 03:13:47,920
